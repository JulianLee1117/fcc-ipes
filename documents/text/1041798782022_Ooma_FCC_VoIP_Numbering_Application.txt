treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").l
Ooma is voluntarily providing this information, "ofa kind that would notcustomarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, Ooma would suffer
substantial competitive harm ifthisinformation weredisclosed.3
ExhibitAis accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECTTO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALTREATMENT
-NOTFOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
