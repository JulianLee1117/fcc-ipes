REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Clear Rate Communications LLC; Supplement to
the Application of Clear Rate Communications LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 25-128
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 Clear Rate Communications LLC ("Clear
Rate Communications") hereby submits supplemental information to its Application for Authorization to
Obtain Numbering Resources originally submitted on March 6, 2025, in the above-mentioned docket
number.
Clear Rate Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment of Exhibit A of the supplement to the application because the documents contain sensitive
trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information
Act ("FOIA").3 Moreover, Clear Rate Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A of the supplement to the application is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT - NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, Clear Rate Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
Clear Rate Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A of the supplement to the
application originally submitted on March 6, 2025.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
Clear Rate Communications is submitting supplemental information per FCC Staff’s request to
provide additional proof of its 911 and 988 obligations under part 9 of the relevant chapter.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”

3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which Clear Rate Communications seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". The
supplemental information outlines Clear Rate Communications’ compliance with its 911 and 988
obligations, which contain proprietary information concerning Clear Rate Communications’
network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A to the supplement of the application contains information relating to commercial
matters which can be used by other interconnected VoIP providers to compromise Clear Rate
Communications’ position in the highly competitive interconnected VoIP business sector.
Detailed operations and commercial information of the type provided by Clear Rate
Communications could compromise Clear Rate Communications’ position in this highly
competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this information would result in substantial
competitive harm to Clear Rate Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use Clear Rate Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to Clear Rate Communications’ detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning Clear Rate Communications’ commercial agreements, as well as
information as to how Clear Rate Communications provides its services. This information is not
normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
Clear Rate Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibit A of the supplement
to the application to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
Clear Rate Communications does not believe that the information is available to the public or
that the information has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non-
disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
Clear Rate Communications requests that the information in Exhibit A of the supplement to the
application be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CLEAR RATE COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns Clear Rate Communications' proprietary network information, related
to current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, Clear Rate Communications respectfully requests that Exhibit A of the
supplement to the application be granted confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
