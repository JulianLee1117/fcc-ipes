REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of First Communications, LLC; Application of First
Communications, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section
52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 22-
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.l5(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 First Communications, LLC ("First
Communications") hereby submits its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
First Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment
to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial
information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3 Moreover, First
Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT - NOT
FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, First Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
First Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
First Communications is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as
proof of First Communications' facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission's Rules.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”

Page 2 of 3
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which First Communications seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A
describes the agreement between First Communications and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning First Communications' network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoIP providers to compromise First Communications’ position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by First Communications could compromise First
Communications' position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this
information would result in substantial competitive harm to First Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use First Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to First Communications’ detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning First Communications’ commercial agreements, as well as information as
to how First Communications provides its services. The prices and terms for the provision of such
services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure of the
Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to First Communications’ carrier
partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
First Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; First
Communications is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement, except
as expressly authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
First Communications does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or
that the Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a
non-disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
First Communications requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. First
Communications and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in effect
indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance would cause
competitive harm to First Communications’ carrier partner regarding of the timing of the
disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT FIRST COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns First Communications' proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, First Communications respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3006 or
via email to croesel@inteserra.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Sincerely,

This ICC June 9, 2004 Order Amendment to the Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and 252 of the

WHEREAS, provisions of the Agreement require the incorporation into the Agreement of new prices such as
those established by the Order; and
WHEREAS, based on the foregoing and except as may be otherwise expressly noted, the Parties are entering
into this Amendment to incorporate pricing changes into the Agreement, subject to the reservation of rights and other
provisions hereof.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

conflict or inconsistency.
2. AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT

under ICC orders. Nothing in this Amendment expands, contracts, or otherwise affects either Party’s rights
or obligations under the Agreement beyond the express provisions of this Amendment.
2.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including anything in the Agreement or this Amendment (including

retroactive application of rates contained in this Amendment is not intended and shall not be construed in
any way to limit either Party to rate application “true-up” provisions contained in the Agreement, any
amendment to that Agreement, including that certain Amendment that contains Schedule 9.2.8, or any FCC
or ICC Orders including the Final Order in ICC Docket No. 01-0662, as such limitation is strictly limited to
those rates specified in Attachment A.
2.4 To the extent the underlying Agreement does not contain terms and conditions for UNE(s) listed in
Attachment A to this Amendment, this Amendment does not provide CLEC with the ability to obtain and/or
order such UNEs. Rather, CLEC must negotiate a separate amendment incorporating the appropriate terms
and conditions into the underlying Agreement before ordering and/or obtaining any such UNE(s) under this
Agreement.
3. AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE DATE
3.1 The effective date of this Amendment shall be immediate upon approval of this Amendment by the ICC

expend diligent efforts to arrive at mutually acceptable new provisions to replace those rejected and/or
modified by the ICC; provided, however, that failure to reach such mutually acceptable new provisions within
ten (10) days after such suspension shall permit either party to terminate this Amendment upon five (5)
days’ written notice to the other.

terminate on the termination or expiration of the Agreement; provided, however, this Amendment, in whole
or in part, may terminate or expire earlier pursuant to other provisions of this Amendment, including Section
6, as provided in Article 28 of the Agreement. This Amendment does not extend the term of the Agreement.
5. APPLICATION OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS
5.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Amendment is the result of ICC rate orders and solely
addresses pricing. Accordingly, the Parties further acknowledge and agree that no aspect of this
Amendment qualifies for portability into any other state under any state or federal statute, regulation, order
or legal obligation (collectively "Law"), if any. The Parties also acknowledge that the entirety of this
Amendment and its provisions are non-severable, and are “legitimately related” as that phrase is understood

collecting and remitting all applicable 911 fees and surcharges on a per line basis to the appropriate Public Safety
Answering Point (“PSAP”) or other governmental authority responsible for collection of such fees and surcharges, and
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree that the existing Interconnection Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and
between Illinois Bell Telephone Company d/b/a SBC Illinois1 (“SBC Illinois”) and Globalcom Inc. (“CLEC”) is hereby
amended as follows:
(1) To the extent that the Agreement contains a “9-1-1” or “E9-1-1” section of the Resale Appendix2 governing CLEC’s
resale operations, (hereafter, “Reseller CLEC”), the parties agree to add the following terms:
(A) Upon the Effective Date of this Amendment, and no later than November 30, 2005, the Parties hereby
agree to comply with the changes made by the Illinois Commerce Commission to the Illinois
Administrative Code (the “Code”), Title 83, Chapter I, subchapter f, Part 725, Section 725.810,
regarding collection and remittance of all applicable 911 fees and surcharges. (B) The Reseller CLEC
is responsible for remitting the aforementioned 9-1-1 surcharges or fees regardless of whether such 9-
1-1 surcharges or fees are billed and/or collected from the Resale End User, and regardless of whether
they are itemized on a per-line basis or simply included as a part of the overall charges assessed to
the Resale End User.

will cease billing the 9-1-1 surcharges to the Reseller CLEC on the monthly Resale Services bill, and

unchanged by this change in billing processes.
(2) All other terms and conditions of the Agreement remain unchanged.
(3) This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall
be coterminous with such Agreement.
(4) EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
(5) In entering into this Amendment and carrying out the provisions herein, neither Party waives, but instead expressly
reserves, all of its rights, remedies and arguments with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings
and any remands thereof and any other federal or state regulatory, legislative or judicial action(s), including, without

AMENDMENT TO
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT
BY AND BETWEEN
ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY d/b/a AT&T ILLINOIS
AND
PEERLESS NETWORK OF ILLINOIS, LLC
Peerless Network of Illinois d/b/a AT&T Illinois1, as the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier in Illinois, (hereafter,
“ILEC”) and Peerless Network of Illinois, LLC as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) in Illinois, (referred to as
“CARRIER”), in order to amend, modify and supersede any affected provisions of their Interconnection Agreement with
ILEC in Illinois (“Interconnection Agreement”), hereby execute this Reciprocal Compensation Amendment for ISP-Bound
Traffic (“Amendment”). CLEC is also referred to as a “LEC”.
1.0 Scope of Amendment
1.1 ILEC made an offer to all telecommunications carriers in the State of Illinois (the “Offer”) to exchange traffic on
and after September 1, 2004 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating
compensation plan of the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order, In the Matter of Implementation of the
Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound
Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel. April 27, 2001) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”) which
was remanded but not vacated in WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 01-1218 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
1.2 The purpose of this Amendment is to include in CARRIER’s Interconnection Agreement the rates, terms and
conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan for the exchange of ISP-bound traffic lawfully
compensable under the FCC ISP Compensation Order (“ISP-bound Traffic”).
1.3 This Amendment is intended to supercede any and all contract sections, appendices, attachments, rate
schedules, or other portions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement that set forth rates, terms and
conditions for the terminating compensation for ISP-bound Traffic. Any inconsistencies between the provisions
of this Amendment and provisions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement shall be governed by the
provisions of this Amendment.
2.0 Rates, Terms and Conditions of FCC’s Interim ISP Terminating Compensation Plan
2.1 ILEC and CARRIER hereby agree that the following rates, terms and conditions shall apply to ISP-bound Traffic
exchanged between the Parties on and after the date this Amendment becomes effective pursuant to Section
4.1 of this Amendment.
2.2 Compensation Rate Schedule
2.2.1 The rates, terms, conditions in this section apply only to the termination of for ISP-bound Traffic, and ISP-
bound Traffic is subject to the rebuttable presumption in Section 2.3.
2.2.2 The Parties agree to compensate each other for the transport and termination for ISP-bound Traffic on a
minute of use basis, at $.0007 per minute of use.
2.3 ISP-bound Traffic Rebuttable Presumption
2.3.1 In accordance with Paragraph 79 of the FCC’s ISP Compensation Order, LEC and ILEC agree that there
is a rebuttable presumption that any of the combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-bound traffic
exchanged between LEC and ILEC exceeding a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio is presumed to be
ISP-bound Traffic subject to the compensation terms in this Section 2.0. Either Party has the right to

rebut the 3:1 ISP presumption by identifying the actual ISP-bound Traffic by any means mutually agreed
by the Parties, or by any method approved by the Commission. If a Party seeking to rebut the
presumption takes appropriate action at the Commission pursuant to Section 252 of the Act and the
Commission agrees that such Party has rebutted the presumption, the methodology and/or means
approved by the Commission for use in determining the ratio shall be utilized by the Parties as of the date
of the Commission approval and, in addition, shall be utilized to determine the appropriate true-up as
described below. During the pendency of any such proceedings to rebut the presumption, LEC and ILEC
will remain obligated to pay reciprocal compensation rates for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and the rates set
forth in Section 2.2.2 for ISP-Bound Traffic. Such true-up shall be retroactive back to the date a Party
first sought appropriate relief from the Commission.
3.0 Reservation of Rights
3.1 The Parties reserve the right to raise the appropriate treatment of Voice Over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) and
traffic utilizing in whole or part Internet Protocol technology under the Dispute Resolution provisions of this
Agreement, including but not limited, to any rights they may have as a result of the FCC’s Order In the Matter of
Petition for Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services are Exempt from Access
Charges, WC Docket No. 02-361 (Rel. April 21, 2004). The Parties acknowledge that there is an on-going
disagreement between LECs and ILEC over whether or not, under the law, VoIP traffic or traffic utilizing in whole
or part IP technology is subject to reciprocal compensation or switched access charges. The Parties therefore
agree that neither one will argue or take the position before any regulatory commission or court that this
Amendment constitutes an agreement as to whether or not reciprocal compensation or switched access charges
apply to that traffic or a waiver by either Party of their position or their rights as to that issue. The Parties further
agree that they each have reserved the right to advocate their respective positions relating to the treatment and
compensation for VoIP traffic and traffic utilizing in whole or part Internet Protocol technology before any state
commission or the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) whether in bilateral complaint dockets,
arbitrations under Section 252 of the Act, state commission or FCC established rulemaking dockets, or before
any judicial or legislative body.
4.0 Miscellaneous
4.1 This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission and shall
become effective ten (10) days following approval by such Commission.
4.2 This Amendment is coterminous with the underlying Interconnection Agreement and does not extend the term or
change the termination provisions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement.
4.3 EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
4.4 Every rate, term and condition of this Amendment is legitimately related to the other rates, terms and conditions
in this Amendment. Without limiting the general applicability of the foregoing, the change of law provisions of
the underlying Interconnection Agreement, including but not limited to the “Intervening Law” or “Change of Law”
or “Regulatory Change” section of the General Terms and Conditions of the Interconnection Agreement and as
modified in this Amendment, are specifically agreed by the Parties to be legitimately related to, and inextricably
intertwined with this the other rates, terms and conditions of this Amendment.
4.5 In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies
or arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying
Agreement (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this
Amendment) with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which
the Parties have not yet fully incorporated into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
