RE: Request for Confidential Treatment to Application of SimpleVoIP, LLC. For
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(G) of the
Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, SimpleVoIP, LLC.;
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources
as an IPES carrier.
SIMPLEVOIP, LLC respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459
of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold
from public inspection, Exhibit A to this application in its entirety as confidential
because the documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive “Pricing”
information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The information in Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not
customarily be released to the public” and therefore, this information qualifies for
confidential treatment under FOIA. SIMPLEVOIP, LLC respectfully submits that it
would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed Under Seal
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s
rules, SIMPLEVOIP, LLC hereby states as follows:
1. SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS

2. CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING THE SUBMISSION PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(2).

Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR, FINANCIAL OR, CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which SIMPLEVOIP, LLC seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors” as defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibit A consists of
commercial agreements between SIMPLEVOIP, LLC and its interconnected VoIP
partner to provide PSTN originating and terminating services, all of which contain
proprietary information concerning SIMPLEVOIP, LLC’s network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS
A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to SIMPLEVOIP, LLC’s disadvantage. SIMPLEVOIP, LLC
has numerous competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it
operates. Detailed commercial information on operations of the type provided by
SIMPLEVOIP, LLC could compromise its position in this highly competitive
industry. Release of this information would therefore result in substantial
competitive harm to SIMPLEVOIP, LLC.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use SIMPLEVOIP, LLC’s proprietary and commercial information
to its detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how SIMPLEVOIP,
LLC provides services as well as about SIMPLEVOIP, LLC’s commercial agreements
with others in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
