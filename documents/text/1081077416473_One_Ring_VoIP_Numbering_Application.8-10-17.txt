Re: Request for Confidential Treatment for Application of One Ring Networks, Inc. For
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, One Ring Networks, Inc.
(“One Ring”) hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering
resources.
One Ring respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and treatment Exhibit 1 to this application as confidential because that document
contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of
the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 The information in Exhibit 1 is “of a kind that
would not customarily be released to the public,” therefore, this information qualified for
confidential treatment under FOIA2 One Ring respectfully submits that it would suffer
substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit 1 is accordingly marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST
FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4
One Ring hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT5
One Ring seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit 1 to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION6
One Ring is submitting the Confidential agreement between it and its carrier partner, as
proof of One Ring’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED7
The information for which One Ring seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.”8
Exhibit 1 consists of a commercial agreement between One Ring and its carrier partner
and contains proprietary commercial information concerning One Ring’s network,
customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION9
Exhibit 1 contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to One Ring’s disadvantage. One Ring has numerous competitors in the
Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed
operations and commercial information of the type provided by One Ring could
compromise One Ring’s position in this highly competitive industry. Release would
therefore result in substantial competitive harm to One Ring.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use One Ring’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
One Ring’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how One
Ring provides services as well as about One Ring’s commercial agreements with others
in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE11
One Ring has not distributed the information in Exhibit 1 to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES12
One Ring has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit 1.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE13
One Ring requests that Exhibit 1 be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit 1.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT ONE RING BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED14
The information concerns One Ring’s proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
Should you have any questions regarding the foregoing information, please don’t hesitate
to contact me.
Respectfully submitted,
