RE: Request for Confidential Treatment to the Application of Versatel, LLC /dba/ 46 Labs
Communications for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to
Section 52.15(G) of the Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Versatel, LLC DBA
46 Labs Communications; here forward known as (“46 Labs”) hereby submits its
application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources as an IPES carrier.
46 Labs respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibits C&D to this application in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive “Pricing” information that
falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
The information in Exhibit C&D is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA. 46
Labs respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibits C&D are accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed Under
Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules, 46
Labs hereby states as follows:
1. SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(1).
46 Labs seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits C&D in its entirety.

2. CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING THE SUBMISSION PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(2).
46 Labs is submitting the confidential agreements between it and its ICA/CLEC
partner as proof of 46Labs’s facilities readiness as required by Section
52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which 46 Labs seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors” as
defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibits C&D consists of commercial
agreements between 46 Labs and its CLEC partner of which contain proprietary
information concerning 46 Labs’ network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION PURSUANT
TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibits C&D contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to 46 Labs’ disadvantage. 46 Labs has numerous
competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it operates. Detailed
commercial information on operations of the type provided by 46 Labs could
compromise its position in this highly competitive industry. Release of this
information would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to 46 Labs.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use 46 Labs’ proprietary and commercial information to its
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how 46 Labs provides
services as well as about 46 Labs’ commercial agreements with others in the
market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR
§ 0.459(b)(6).

46 Labs has not distributed the information in Confidential Exhibits C&D to the
public or any parties within 46 Labs or outside 46 Labs except on a need-to-know
basis.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF
THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(7).
46 Labs deems the information in Exhibits C&D to be confidential.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE TIME FRAME DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY BELIEVES THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(8).
46 Labs requests that Confidential Exhibits C&D be treated as confidential for a
period of five years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the
information in Confidential Exhibits C&D.
9. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT 46 Labs BELIEVES MAY BE HELPFUL IN
DETERMINING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(9).
The information deals with 46 Labs’ proprietary network, related to current and
planned operations, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
