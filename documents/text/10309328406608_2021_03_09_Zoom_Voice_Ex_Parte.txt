Re: Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Application Filed by Zoom Voice
Communications, Inc. Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3) of the Commission’s Rules,
WC Docket No. 20-419
Dear Ms. Dortch:
On March 5, on behalf of Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., Dan Tingley and I, both of
Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, met by phone with Melissa Kirkel, Michelle Sclater, and
Jordan Reth of the Wireline Competition Bureau to discuss the above-captioned application and
comments on the application filed by CarrierX.1
On the call, Zoom Voice explained that CarrierX raised no public interest concerns
related to Zoom Voice’s application that merited further review by the Commission. Zoom
Voice noted that the Commission previously had examined the generalized concerns raised by
CarrierX and addressed them through notice and comment rulemaking.2 Zoom further noted it
would not be appropriate to address CarrierX’s concerns in this party-specific proceeding.
Sincerely,
/s/
Brita D. Strandberg
Counsel to Zoom Voice
Communications, Inc.
