Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, EON Telecom, Inc
; here forward known as (“EON Telecom”) hereby submits its application requesting
authorization to obtain numbering resources as an IPES carrier.
EON Telecom respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibit A to this application in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive “Pricing” information that
falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
The information in Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
EON Telecom respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed Under Seal
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,
EON Telecom hereby states as follows:
