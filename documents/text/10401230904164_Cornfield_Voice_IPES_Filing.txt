Re: Request for Confidential Treatment, Application of Cornfield Voice LLC for Authority to
Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules.
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Cornfield Voice LLC (“Cornfield”) encloses for filing its Application to Obtain Numbering
Resources ("Application") and corresponding Confidential Exhibit A, an agreement between
Cornfield and its carrier partner (Confidential Exhibit A or "Carrier Agreement"). The Application
and its exhibits are sent to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(ii) of the Commission's
Rules.
Cornfield respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and
accord confidential treatment to the Carrier Agreement. The document contains trade secrets
and commercial, technical and financial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom
of Information Act ("FOIA").
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute "does
not apply to matters that are ... ( 4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential." Cornfield is voluntarily providing this
trade secret and commercial and financial information "of a kind that would not customarily be
released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under Exemption 4 of FOIA.
Moreover, Cornfield would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Carrier Agreement was
disclosed and if the identity of its carrier partner was disclosed.
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules, Cornfield
hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT

Cornfield seeks confidential treatment of the 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner
Agreement, submitted with the Application as Confidential Exhibits A, B, and C respectively.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
The 911 Agreement and CALEA Plan are being submitted to the Commission as proof it
complies with its obligations as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(E) of the Commission’s rules.
The CLEC Partner Agreement is being submitted to the Commission as proof of facilities
readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(H) of the Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED
The information for which Cornfield seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial,
financial, and technical information as described in Section 0.457( d) of the Commission's rules.
The 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner Agreement contain trade secrets and
proprietary commercial and technical information relating to the manner in which Cornfield and
its carrier partner conduct network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A
SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION
The 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner Agreement provide detailed information
relating to commercial and operational matters that could be used by competitors to the
disadvantage of Cornfield. Disclosure of Cornfield’s confidential information would cause
substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM
Competitors could use the information in the 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner
Agreement to Cornfield’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive and proprietary
information about how Cornfield provides services as well as about Cornfield’s commercial
agreements with others that are not ordinarily disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO
PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
Cornfield has made the substance of the 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner
Agreement known only to those employees who have a need to know the subject matter and
those employees are aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The 911
Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner Agreement have not been disclosed by Cornfield

to any non-signatories outside Cornfield except pursuant to appropriate confidentiality
agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES
Cornfield has not previously disclosed the 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, or CLEC Partner
Agreement.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
Cornfield requests that the 911 Agreement, CALEA Plan, and CLEC Partner Agreement be
treated as confidential and should never be released for public inspection. This is necessary
because its information is commercially sensitive and confidential and any release would
commercially disadvantage Cornfield.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CORNFIELD BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED
Under applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by
Cornfield on a confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of
FOIA shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a
person outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial
information in question clearly satisfies this test. As such, Cornfield respectfully requests the
Commission keep Exhibits A, B, and C within the enclosed document confidential and withhold
them from public inspection.
Respectfully submitted,
Justin B Newman

Application of Cornfield Voice LLC
For Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Cornfield Voice LLC (“Cornfield”), hereby respectfully requests authorization from the
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) for numbering resources
pursuant to Commission Rule Section 52.15(g)(3)(ii). The company is owned by Uptown Moose,
Inc., which is in turn owned by long-time telecommunications executive Justin Newman.
Under the Commission’s Numbering Order, an interconnected VoIP provider may obtain
numbering resources from the Numbering Administrator upon a showing that it is authorized to
provide service in the area for which the numbering resources are requested. Such
authorization may be obtained upon an application to the Commission containing the
information detailed in Section 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(A)-(N) of the Commission’s Rules. The number
resources that are the subject of the Application will be used to provide services initially in the
District of Columbia, although Cornfield ultimately intends to provide such service throughout
the United States.
Cornfield has negotiated an Interconnect Agreement with a Competitive Local Exchange
Carrier (“CLEC Partner”) to serve as Cornfield’s access homing tandem and to route local and
access traffic (both originating and terminating) to the PSTN. Cornfield will interconnect with and
broadcast CLEC Partner’s tandem platforms for the purpose of managing Cornfield’s assigned
Operating Company Number (OCN). To further support this application, Cornfield provides the

AGREEMENT
PREFACE
This Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective as of September 1, 2015 (the “Effective
Date”), between Wide Voice, LLC (“Wide Voice”), a limited liability company organized under the
laws of the State of Nevada, with offices at 410 South Rampart, Suite 390, Las Vegas, NV 89145
and Verizon Washington, DC Inc. (“Verizon”), a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of New York with offices at 1300 I Street, N.W., Suite 400 West, Washington, DC 20005 (Verizon
and Wide Voice may be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a “Party”, and, collectively,
as the “Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and Wide Voice hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and Wide Voice.
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 1

1.4 Except as otherwise provided in the Principal Document, the Principal Document
may not be waived or modified except by a written document that is signed by
the Parties. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, a Party shall have
the right to add, modify, or withdraw, its Tariff(s) at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the other Party.
2. Term and Termination
2.1 This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and, unless cancelled
or terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, shall continue in effect
until August 31, 2017 (the “Initial Term”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall
continue in force and effect unless and until cancelled or terminated as provided
in this Agreement.
2.2 Either Wide Voice or Verizon may terminate this Agreement effective upon the
expiration of the Initial Term or effective upon any date after expiration of the
Initial Term by providing written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days in
advance of the date of termination.
2.3 If Wide Voice or Verizon provides notice of termination pursuant to Section 2.2
and on or before the proposed date of termination either Wide Voice or Verizon
has requested negotiation of a new interconnection agreement, unless this
Agreement is cancelled or terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof
(including, but not limited to, pursuant to Section 12), this Agreement shall
remain in effect until the earlier of: (a) the effective date of a new interconnection
agreement between Wide Voice and Verizon; or, (b) the date one (1) year after
the proposed date of termination.
2.4 If Wide Voice or Verizon provides notice of termination pursuant to Section 2.2,
and by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposed date of termination neither Wide
Voice nor Verizon has requested negotiation of a new interconnection agreement
(or, in accordance with Subsection 2.3(b), if no new agreement is reached by the
date one (1) year after the proposed date of termination), then (a) this Agreement
will terminate at 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposed date of termination (or
in the case of termination in accordance with Subsection 2.3(b), at 11:59 PM
Eastern Time on the date one (1) year after the proposed date of termination),
and (b) the Services being provided under this Agreement at the time of
termination will be terminated, except to the extent that the Purchasing Party has
requested that such Services continue to be provided pursuant to an applicable
Tariff or Statement of Generally Available Terms (SGAT).

District of Columbia, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. All disputes
relating to this Agreement shall be resolved through the application of such laws.
4.2 Each Party shall remain in compliance with Applicable Law in the course of
performing this Agreement.
4.3 Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance by it that
results from requirements of Applicable Law, or acts or failures to act of any
governmental entity or official.
4.4 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any governmental
action that limits, suspends, cancels, withdraws, or otherwise materially affects,
the notifying Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
4.5 If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under
Applicable Law, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall
be construed as if it did not contain such invalid or unenforceable provision;
provided, that if the invalid or unenforceable provision is a material provision of
this Agreement, or the invalidity or unenforceability materially affects the rights or
obligations of a Party hereunder or the ability of a Party to perform any material
provision of this Agreement, the Parties shall promptly renegotiate in good faith
and amend in writing this Agreement in order to make such mutually acceptable
revisions to this Agreement as may be required in order to conform the
Agreement to Applicable Law.
4.6 If any legislative, regulatory, judicial or other governmental decision, order,
determination or action, or any change in Applicable Law, materially affects any
material provision of this Agreement, the rights or obligations of a Party
hereunder, or the ability of a Party to perform any material provision of this
Agreement, the Parties shall promptly renegotiate in good faith and amend in
writing this Agreement in order to make such mutually acceptable revisions to
this Agreement as may be required in order to conform the Agreement to
Applicable Law. If within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such decision,
determination, action or change, the Parties are unable to agree in writing upon
mutually acceptable revisions to this Agreement, either Party may pursue any
remedies available to it under this Agreement, at law, in equity, or otherwise,
including, but not limited to, instituting an appropriate proceeding before the
Commission, the FCC, or a court of competent jurisdiction, without first pursuing
dispute resolution in accordance with Section 14 of this Agreement.
4.6.1 Notwithstanding Section 4.6 above, to the extent Verizon is required
by a change in Applicable Law to provide to Wide Voice a Service that
is not offered under this Agreement to Wide Voice, the terms,
conditions and prices for such Service (including, but not limited to, the
terms and conditions defining the Service and stating when and where
the Service will be available and how it will be used, and terms,
conditions and prices for pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, repair,
maintenance and billing) shall be as provided in an applicable Verizon
Tariff, or, in the absence of an applicable Verizon Tariff, as mutually
agreed by the Parties in a written amendment to the Agreement that,
upon the request of either Party, the Parties shall negotiate in
accordance with the requirements of Section 252 of the Act. In no
event shall Verizon be required to provide any such Service in the
absence of such a Verizon Tariff or amendment.
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 3

4.7 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, as a result of any
legislative, judicial, regulatory or other governmental decision, order,
determination or action, or any change in Applicable Law, Verizon is not required
by Applicable Law to provide any Service, payment or benefit, otherwise required
to be provided to Wide Voice hereunder, then Verizon may discontinue the
provision of any such Service, payment or benefit, and Wide Voice shall
reimburse Verizon for any payment previously made by Verizon to Wide Voice
that was not required by Applicable Law. Verizon will provide thirty (30) days
prior written notice to Wide Voice of any such discontinuance of a Service, unless
a different notice period or different conditions are specified in this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, in the Networks Element Attachment or an
applicable Tariff) or Applicable Law for termination of such Service in which event
such specified period and/or conditions shall apply. For the avoidance of any
doubt, this Section 4.7 is self-effectuating and no amendment to this Agreement
shall be required to implement it.
5. Assignment
Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any right or interest under this Agreement,
nor delegate any obligation under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 5 shall be void and
ineffective and constitute default of this Agreement.
6. Assurance of Payment
6.1 Upon request by Verizon, Wide Voice shall, at any time and from time to time,
provide to Verizon adequate assurance of payment of amounts due (or to
become due) to Verizon hereunder.
6.2 Assurance of payment of charges may be requested by Verizon if Wide Voice or
its Affiliates (a) prior to the Effective Date, has failed to timely pay a bill rendered
to Wide Voice by Verizon or its Affiliates, (b) on or after the Effective Date, fails to
timely pay a bill rendered to Wide Voice by Verizon or its Affiliates, (c) in
Verizon’s reasonable judgment, at the Effective Date or at any time thereafter, is
unable to demonstrate that it is creditworthy, or (d) admits its inability to pay its
debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary case (or has had
a case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other law
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or
adjustment of debts or the like, has made an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding.
6.3 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the assurance of payment shall consist
of an unconditional, irrevocable standby letter of credit naming Verizon as the
beneficiary thereof and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to Verizon
from a financial institution acceptable to Verizon. The letter of credit shall be in
an amount equal to two (2) months anticipated charges (including, but not limited
to, both recurring and non-recurring charges), as reasonably determined by
Verizon, for the Services to be provided by Verizon to Wide Voice in connection
with this Agreement. If Wide Voice or its Affiliates meets the condition in
subsection 6.2(d) above or has failed to timely pay two or more bills rendered by
Verizon or a Verizon Affiliate in any twelve (12)-month period, Verizon may, at its
option, demand (and Wide Voice shall provide) additional assurance of payment,
including monthly advanced payments of estimated charges as reasonably
determined by Verizon, with appropriate true-up against actual billed charges no
more frequently than once per Calendar Quarter.
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 4

6.4 Verizon may (but is not obligated to) draw on the letter of credit upon notice to
Wide Voice in respect of any amounts to be paid by Wide Voice hereunder that
are not paid within thirty (30) days of the date that payment of such amounts is
required by this Agreement.
6.5 If Verizon draws on the letter of credit, upon request by Verizon, Wide Voice shall
provide a replacement or supplemental letter of credit conforming to the
requirements of Section 6.3.
6.6 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if Verizon makes a
request for assurance of payment in accordance with the terms of this Section,
then Verizon shall have no obligation thereafter to perform under this Agreement
until such time as Wide Voice has provided Verizon with such assurance of
payment.
6.7 The fact that a letter of credit is requested by Verizon hereunder shall in no way
relieve Wide Voice from compliance with the requirements of this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, any applicable Tariffs) as to advance payments and
payment for Services, nor constitute a waiver or modification of the terms herein
pertaining to the discontinuance of Services for nonpayment of any amounts
payment of which is required by this Agreement.
7. Audits
7.1 Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, either Party
(“Auditing Party”) may audit the other Party’s (“Audited Party”) books, records,
documents, facilities and systems for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of
the Audited Party’s bills. Such audits may be performed once in each Calendar
Year; provided, however, that audits may be conducted more frequently (but no
more frequently than once in each Calendar Quarter) if the immediately
preceding audit found previously uncorrected net inaccuracies in billing in favor
of the Audited Party having an aggregate value of at least $1,000,000.
7.2 The audit shall be performed by independent certified public accountants
selected and paid by the Auditing Party. The accountants shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Audited Party. Prior to commencing the audit, the accountants
shall execute an agreement with the Audited Party in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Audited Party that protects the confidentiality of the information
disclosed by the Audited Party to the accountants. The audit shall take place at
a time and place agreed upon by the Parties; provided, that the Auditing Party
may require that the audit commence no later than sixty (60) days after the
Auditing Party has given notice of the audit to the Audited Party.
7.3 Each Party shall cooperate fully in any such audit, providing reasonable access
to any and all employees, books, records, documents, facilities and systems,
reasonably necessary to assess the accuracy of the Audited Party’s bills.
7.4 Audits shall be performed at the Auditing Party’s expense, provided that there
shall be no charge for reasonable access to the Audited Party’s employees,
books, records, documents, facilities and systems necessary to assess the
accuracy of the Audited Party’s bills.
8. Authorization
8.1 Verizon represents and warrants that it is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York and has
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 5

full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.
8.2 Wide Voice represents and warrants that it is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Nevada, and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
8.3 Wide Voice Certification.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Verizon shall have no
obligation to perform under this Agreement until such time as Wide Voice has
obtained such FCC and Commission authorization as may be required by
Applicable Law for conducting its business in the District of Columbia. Wide
Voice shall not place any Orders under this Agreement until it has obtained such
authorization. Wide Voice shall provide proof of such authorization to Verizon
upon request.
9. Billing and Payment; Disputed Amounts
9.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall submit to the
other Party on a monthly basis in an itemized form, statement(s) of charges
incurred by the other Party under this Agreement.
9.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, payment of amounts billed for
Services provided under this Agreement, whether billed on a monthly basis or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be due, in immediately available U.S.
funds, on the later of the following dates (the “Due Date”): (a) the due date
specified on the billing Party’s statement; or (b) twenty (20) days after the date
the statement is received by the billed Party. Payments shall be transmitted by
electronic funds transfer.
9.3 If any portion of an amount billed by a Party under this Agreement is subject to a
good faith dispute between the Parties, the billed Party shall give notice to the
billing Party of the amounts it disputes (“Disputed Amounts”) and include in such
notice the specific details and reasons for disputing each item. A Party may also
dispute prospectively with a single notice a class of charges that it disputes.
Notice of a dispute may be given by a Party at any time, either before or after an
amount is paid, and a Party’s payment of an amount shall not constitute a waiver
of such Party’s right to subsequently dispute its obligation to pay such amount or
to seek a refund of any amount paid. The billed Party shall pay by the Due Date
all undisputed amounts. Billing disputes shall be subject to the terms of Section
14, Dispute Resolution.
9.4 Charges due to the billing Party that are not paid by the Due Date, shall be
subject to a late payment charge. The late payment charge shall be in an
amount specified by the billing Party which shall not exceed a rate of one-and-
one-half percent (1.5%) of the overdue amount (including any unpaid previously
billed late payment charges) per month.
9.5 Although it is the intent of both Parties to submit timely statements of charges,
failure by either Party to present statements to the other Party in a timely manner
shall not constitute a breach or default, or a waiver of the right to payment of the
incurred charges, by the billing Party under this Agreement, and, except for
assertion of a provision of Applicable Law that limits the period in which a suit or
other proceeding can be brought before a court or other governmental entity of
appropriate jurisdiction to collect amounts due, the billed Party shall not be
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 6

entitled to dispute the billing Party’s statement(s) based on the billing Party’s
failure to submit them in a timely fashion.
10. Confidentiality
10.1 As used in this Section 10, “Confidential Information” means the following

Service, such as directory assistance, operator service, Caller ID or
similar service, or LIDB service, or (c) the Customer to whom the
Customer Information is related has authorized the Receiving Party to
use and/or disclose the Customer Information);
10.1.4 information related to specific facilities or equipment (including, but not
limited to, cable and pair information);
10.1.5 any information that is in written, graphic, electromagnetic, or other
tangible form, and marked at the time of disclosure as “Confidential” or

the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure, and by written notice with
a statement of the information given to the Receiving Party within ten
(10) days after disclosure, to be “Confidential” or “Proprietary”.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Party shall have the
right to refuse to accept receipt of information which the other Party has identified
as Confidential Information pursuant to Sections 10.1.5 or 10.1.6.
10.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall:
10.2.1 use the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party
only in performance of this Agreement; and
10.2.2 using the same degree of care that it uses with similar confidential
information of its own (but in no case a degree of care that is less than
commercially reasonable), hold Confidential Information received from
the Disclosing Party in confidence and restrict disclosure of the
Confidential Information solely to those of the Receiving Party’s
Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees, Agents and
contractors of the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Affiliates,
that have a need to receive such Confidential Information in order to
perform the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The
Receiving Party’s Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees,
Agents and contractors of the Receiving Party and the Receiving
Party’s Affiliates, shall be required by the Receiving Party to comply
with the provisions of this Section 10 in the same manner as the
Receiving Party. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any failure of
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 7

the Receiving Party’s Affiliates or the directors, officers, employees,
Agents or contractors of the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s
Affiliates, to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.
10.3 The Receiving Party shall return or destroy all Confidential Information received
from the Disclosing Party, including any copies made by the Receiving Party,
within thirty (30) days after a written request by the Disclosing Party is delivered
to the Receiving Party, except for (a) Confidential Information that the Receiving
Party reasonably requires to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and
(b) one copy for archival purposes only.
10.4 Unless otherwise agreed, the obligations of Sections 10.2 and 10.3 do not apply
to information that:
10.4.1 was, at the time of receipt, already in the possession of or known to
the Receiving Party free of any obligation of confidentiality and
restriction on use;
10.4.2 is or becomes publicly available or known through no wrongful act of
the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party’s Affiliates, or the directors,
officers, employees, Agents or contractors of the Receiving Party or
the Receiving Party’s Affiliates;
10.4.3 is rightfully received from a third person having no direct or indirect
obligation of confidentiality or restriction on use to the Disclosing Party
with respect to such information;
10.4.4 is independently developed by the Receiving Party;
10.4.5 is approved for disclosure or use by written authorization of the
Disclosing Party (including, but not limited to, in this Agreement); or
10.4.6 is required to be disclosed by the Receiving Party pursuant to
Applicable Law, provided that the Receiving Party shall have made
commercially reasonable efforts to give adequate notice of the
requirement to the Disclosing Party in order to enable the Disclosing
Party to seek protective arrangements.
10.5 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.1 through 10.4, the Receiving
Party may use and disclose Confidential Information received from the Disclosing
Party to the extent necessary to enforce the Receiving Party’s rights under this
Agreement or Applicable Law. In making any such disclosure, the Receiving
Party shall make reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality and restrict the
use of the Confidential Information while it is in the possession of any person to
whom it is disclosed, including, but not limited to, by requesting any
governmental entity to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed to treat it
as confidential and restrict its use to purposes related to the proceeding pending
before it.
10.6 The Disclosing Party shall retain all of the Disclosing Party’s right, title and
interest in any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the
Receiving Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no
license is granted by this Agreement with respect to any Confidential Information
(including, but not limited to, under any patent, trademark or copyright), nor is
any such license to be implied solely by virtue of the disclosure of Confidential
Information.
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 8

10.7 The provisions of this Section 10 shall be in addition to and not in derogation of
any provisions of Applicable Law, including, but not limited to, 47 U.S.C. § 222,
and are not intended to constitute a waiver by a Party of any right with regard to
the use, or protection of the confidentiality of, CPNI provided by Applicable Law.
10.8 Each Party’s obligations under this Section 10 shall survive expiration,
cancellation or termination of this Agreement.
11. Counterparts
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.
12. Default
If either Party (“Defaulting Party”) fails to make a payment required by this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, any payment required by Section 9.3 of undisputed amounts
to the billing Party) or materially breaches any other material provision of this Agreement,
and such failure or breach continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
the other Party, the other Party may, by written notice to the Defaulting Party, (a)
suspend the provision of any or all Services hereunder, or (b) cancel this Agreement and
terminate the provision of all Services hereunder.
13. Discontinuance of Service by Wide Voice
13.1 If Wide Voice proposes to discontinue, or actually discontinues, its provision of
service to all or substantially all of its Customers, whether voluntarily, as a result
of bankruptcy, or for any other reason, Wide Voice shall send written notice of
such discontinuance to Verizon, the Commission, and each of Wide Voice’s
Customers. Wide Voice shall provide such notice such number of days in
advance of discontinuance of its service as shall be required by Applicable Law.
Unless the period for advance notice of discontinuance of service required by
Applicable Law is more than thirty (30) days, to the extent commercially feasible,
Wide Voice shall send such notice at least thirty (30) days prior to its
discontinuance of service.
13.2 Such notice must advise each Wide Voice Customer that unless action is taken
by the Wide Voice Customer to switch to a different carrier prior to Wide Voice’s
proposed discontinuance of service, the Wide Voice Customer will be without the
service provided by Wide Voice to the Wide Voice Customer.
13.3 Should a Wide Voice Customer subsequently become a Verizon Customer, Wide
Voice shall provide Verizon with all information necessary for Verizon to establish
service for the Wide Voice Customer, including, but not limited to, the Wide Voice
Customer’s billed name, listed name, service address, and billing address, and
the services being provided to the Wide Voice Customer.
13.4 Nothing in this Section 13 shall limit Verizon’s right to cancel or terminate this
Agreement or suspend provision of Services under this Agreement.
14. Dispute Resolution
14.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any dispute between the Parties
regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any of its terms
shall be addressed by good faith negotiation between the Parties. To initiate
such negotiation, a Party must provide to the other Party written notice of the
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 9

dispute that includes both a detailed description of the dispute or alleged
nonperformance and the name of an individual who will serve as the initiating
Party’s representative in the negotiation. The other Party shall have ten
Business Days to designate its own representative in the negotiation. The
Parties’ representatives shall meet at least once within 45 days after the date of
the initiating Party’s written notice in an attempt to reach a good faith resolution
of the dispute. Upon agreement, the Parties’ representatives may utilize other
alternative dispute resolution procedures such as private mediation to assist in
the negotiations.
14.2 If the Parties have been unable to resolve the dispute within 45 days of the date
of the initiating Party’s written notice, either Party may pursue any remedies
available to it under this Agreement, at law, in equity, or otherwise, including, but
not limited to, instituting an appropriate proceeding before the Commission, the
FCC, or a court of competent jurisdiction.
15. Force Majeure
15.1 Neither Party shall be responsible for any delay or failure in performance which
results from causes beyond its reasonable control (“Force Majeure Events”),
whether or not foreseeable by such Party. Such Force Majeure Events include,
but are not limited to, adverse weather conditions, flood, fire, explosion,
earthquake, volcanic action, power failure, embargo, boycott, war, revolution, civil
commotion, act of public enemies, labor unrest (including, but not limited to,
strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, picketing or boycotts), inability to obtain
equipment, parts, software or repairs thereof, acts or omissions of the other
Party, and acts of God.
15.2 If a Force Majeure Event occurs, the non-performing Party shall give prompt
notification of its inability to perform to the other Party. During the period that the
non-performing Party is unable to perform, the other Party shall also be excused
from performance of its obligations to the extent such obligations are reciprocal
to, or depend upon, the performance of the non-performing Party that has been
prevented by the Force Majeure Event. The non-performing Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the cause(s) of its non-
performance and both Parties shall proceed to perform once the cause(s) are
removed or cease.
15.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1 and 15.2, in no case shall a
Force Majeure Event excuse either Party from an obligation to pay money as
required by this Agreement.
15.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall require the non-performing Party to settle any
labor dispute except as the non-performing Party, in its sole discretion,
determines appropriate.
16. Forecasts
In addition to any other forecasts required by this Agreement, upon request by Verizon,
Wide Voice shall provide to Verizon forecasts regarding the Services that Wide Voice
expects to purchase from Verizon, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding the
types and volumes of Services that Wide Voice expects to purchase and the locations
where such Services will be purchased.
17. Fraud
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 10

investigate or make adjustments to Wide Voice's account in cases of, fraud by Wide
Voice’s Customers or other third parties.

The Parties shall act in good faith in their performance of this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, where
consent, approval, agreement or a similar action is stated to be within a Party’s sole
discretion), where consent, approval, mutual agreement or a similar action is required by
any provision of this Agreement, such action shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If and, to the extent that, Verizon, prior to the Effective Date of
this Agreement, has not provided in the District of Columbia a Service offered under this
Agreement, Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with Wide Voice
reasonable terms and conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation
timeframes) for such Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either
Party may utilize the Agreement’s dispute resolution procedures.

20. Indemnification
20.1 Each Party (“Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other Party (“Indemnified Party”), the Indemnified Party’s Affiliates, and the
directors, officers and employees of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified
Party’s Affiliates, from and against any and all Claims that arise out of bodily
injury to or death of any person, or damage to, or destruction or loss of, tangible
real and/or personal property of any person, to the extent such injury, death,
damage, destruction or loss, was proximately caused by the grossly negligent or
intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party’s Affiliates, or the directors, officers, employees, Agents or
contractors (excluding the Indemnified Party) of the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnifying Party’s Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement.
20.2 Indemnification Process.
20.2.1 As used in this Section 20, “Indemnified Person” means a person
whom an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify, defend and/or
hold harmless under Section 20.1.
20.2.2 An Indemnifying Party’s obligations under Section 20.1 shall be
conditioned upon the following:
20.2.3 The Indemnified Person: (a) shall give the Indemnifying Party notice
of the Claim promptly after becoming aware thereof (including a
statement of facts known to the Indemnified Person related to the
Claim and an estimate of the amount thereof); (b) prior to taking any
material action with respect to a Third Party Claim, shall consult with
the Indemnifying Party as to the procedure to be followed in defending,
settling, or compromising the Claim; (c) shall not consent to any
settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim without the written
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 11

consent of the Indemnifying Party; (d) shall permit the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (including, except
as provided below, the compromise or settlement thereof) at the
Indemnifying Party’s own cost and expense, provided, however, that
the Indemnified Person shall have the right to approve the
Indemnifying Party's choice of legal counsel.
20.2.4 If the Indemnified Person fails to comply with Section 20.2.3 with
respect to a Claim, to the extent such failure shall have a material
adverse effect upon the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be relieved of its obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Indemnified Person with respect to such Claim under this
Agreement.
20.2.5 Subject to 20.2.6 and 20.2.7, below, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the authority to defend and settle any Third Party Claim.
20.2.6 With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of the
Claim if the Claim requests equitable relief or other relief that could
affect the rights of the Indemnified Person. In so participating, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to employ separate counsel for
the defense at the Indemnified Person’s expense. The Indemnified
Person shall also be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of any Claim, as to any portion of the Claim as to which it is
not entitled to be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the
Indemnifying Party.
20.2.7 In no event shall the Indemnifying Party settle a Third Party Claim or
consent to any judgment with regard to a Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event the
settlement or judgment requires a contribution from or affects the
rights of an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall have the
right to refuse such settlement or judgment with respect to itself and,
at its own cost and expense, take over the defense against the Third
Party Claim, provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify or hold
harmless the Indemnified Person against, the Third Party Claim for
any amount in excess of such refused settlement or judgment.
20.2.8 The Indemnified Person shall, in all cases, assert any and all
provisions in applicable Tariffs and Customer contracts that limit
liability to third persons as a bar to, or limitation on, any recovery by a
third-person claimant.
20.2.9 The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person shall offer each
other all reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense of any
Third Party Claim.
20.3 Each Party agrees that it will not implead or bring any action against the other
Party, the other Party’s Affiliates, or any of the directors, officers or employees of
the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliates, based on any claim by any person
for personal injury or death that occurs in the course or scope of employment of
such person by the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliate and that arises out of
performance of this Agreement.

asserting that the provision or use of any service, facility, arrangement, or
software by either Party under this Agreement, or the performance of any service
or method, either alone or in combination with the other Party, constitutes direct,
vicarious or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe, or misuse or

subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in any applicable

license agreements) between Verizon and Verizon’s vendors. Verizon agrees to
advise Wide Voice, directly or through a third party, of any such terms, conditions
or restrictions that may limit any Wide Voice use of a Service provided by Verizon

to the extent required by Applicable Law, Verizon will use Verizon’s best efforts,
as commercially practicable, to obtain intellectual property rights from Verizon’s
vendor to allow Wide Voice to use the Service in the same manner as Verizon
that are coextensive with Verizon’s intellectual property rights, on terms and
conditions that are equal in quality to the terms and conditions under which
Verizon has obtained Verizon’s intellectual property rights. Wide Voice shall
reimburse Verizon for the cost of obtaining such rights.

other person shall be limited to the smaller of the amounts for which such Party
or other person would be liable under this Section or the Tariff provision.
25.7 Each Party shall, in its tariffs and other contracts with its Customers, provide that
in no case shall the other Party, the other Party’s Affiliates, or the directors,
officers or employees of the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliates, be liable to
such Customers or other third-persons for any special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, reliance, exemplary, punitive or other damages, arising out of a
Service Failure.
26. Network Management
26.1 Cooperation. The Parties will work cooperatively in a commercially reasonable
manner to install and maintain a reliable network. Wide Voice and Verizon will
exchange appropriate information (e.g., network information, maintenance
contact numbers, escalation procedures, and information required to comply with
requirements of law enforcement and national security agencies) to achieve this
desired reliability. In addition, the Parties will work cooperatively in a
commercially reasonable manner to apply sound network management principles
to alleviate or to prevent traffic congestion and subject to Section 17, to minimize
fraud associated with third number billed calls, calling card calls, and other
services related to this Agreement.
26.2 Responsibility for Following Standards. Each Party recognizes a responsibility to
follow the standards that may be agreed to between the Parties and to employ
characteristics and methods of operation that will not interfere with or impair the
service, network or facilities of the other Party or any third parties connected with
or involved directly in the network or facilities of the other.
26.3 Interference or Impairment. If a Party (“Impaired Party”) reasonably determines
that the services, network, facilities, or methods of operation, of the other Party
(“Interfering Party”) will or are likely to interfere with or impair the Impaired Party’s
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 16

provision of services or the operation of the Impaired Party’s network or facilities,
the Impaired Party may interrupt or suspend any Service provided to the
Interfering Party to the extent necessary to prevent such interference or
impairment, subject to the following:
26.3.1 Except in emergency situations (e.g., situations involving a risk of
bodily injury to persons or damage to tangible property, or an
interruption in Customer service) or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Impaired Party shall have given the Interfering Party at
least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the interference or
impairment or potential interference or impairment and the need to
correct the condition within said time period; and taken other actions, if
any, required by Applicable Law; and,
26.3.2 Upon correction of the interference or impairment, the Impaired Party
will promptly restore the interrupted or suspended Service. The
Impaired Party shall not be obligated to provide an out-of-service
credit allowance or other compensation to the Interfering Party in
connection with the suspended Service.

being provided by a Party hereunder, the Providing Party will follow Verizon’s
standard procedures for isolating and clearing the outage or trouble.

provided under this Agreement is cumulative and is in addition to any other remedies that
may be available under this Agreement or at law or in equity.
28. Notice of Network Changes
If a Party makes a change in the information necessary for the transmission and routing
of services using that Party’s facilities or network, or any other change in its facilities or
network that will materially affect the interoperability of its facilities or network with the
other Party’s facilities or network, the Party making the change shall publish notice of the
change at least ninety (90) days in advance of such change, and shall use reasonable
efforts, as commercially practicable, to publish such notice at least one hundred eighty
(180) days in advance of the change; provided, however, that if an earlier publication of
notice of a change is required by Applicable Law (including, but not limited to, 47 CFR
51.325 through 51.335) notice shall be given at the time required by Applicable Law.

41. Taxes
41.1 In General. With respect to any purchase of Services under this Agreement, if
any federal, state or local tax, fee, surcharge or other tax-like charge, excluding
any tax levied on property or net income, (a "Tax") is required or permitted by
Applicable Law or a Tariff to be collected from the Purchasing Party by the
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 21

Providing Party, then (a) the Providing Party shall bill the Purchasing Party for
such Tax, as a separately stated item on the invoice, (b) the Purchasing Party
shall timely remit such Tax to the Providing Party and (c) the Providing Party
shall timely remit such collected Tax to the applicable taxing authority as and to
the extent required by Applicable Law.
41.2 Taxes Imposed on the Providing Party or Receipts. With respect to any
purchase of Services under this Agreement, if any federal, state or local Tax is
imposed by Applicable Law on the receipts of the Providing Party, and such
Applicable Law permits the Providing Party to exclude certain receipts received
from sales to a public utility, distributor, telephone company, local exchange
carrier, telecommunications company or other communications company
(“Telecommunications Company”), such exclusion being based on the fact that
the Purchasing Party is also subject to a tax based upon receipts (“Receipts
Tax”), then the Purchasing Party shall pay and remit the Receipts Tax as
required by Applicable Law.
41.3 Taxes Imposed on Subscriber. With respect to any purchase of Services under
this Agreement that are resold to a third party, if any federal, state or local Tax is
imposed by Applicable Law on the subscriber, end-user, customer or ultimate
consumer (“Subscriber”) in connection with any such purchase, which a
Telecommunications Company is required to impose and/or collect from a
Subscriber, or if any federal, state or local Tax is imposed on the Providing Party
and required by Applicable Law to be passed through to the Subscriber, then the
Purchasing Party (a) shall impose and/or collect such Tax from the Subscriber
and (b) shall timely remit such Tax to the applicable taxing authority.
41.4 Tax Exemptions and Exemption Certificates. If Applicable Law clearly exempts a
purchase hereunder from a Tax, and if such Applicable Law also provides an
exemption procedure, such as an exemption certificate requirement, then, if the
Purchasing Party complies with such procedure, the Providing Party shall not
collect such Tax during the effective period of such exemption. Such exemption
shall be effective upon receipt of the exemption certificate or affidavit in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 41.7. If Applicable Law clearly
exempts a purchase hereunder from a Tax, but does not also provide an
exemption procedure, then the Providing Party shall not collect such Tax if the
Purchasing Party (a) furnishes the Providing Party with a letter signed by an
officer requesting such an exemption and citing the provision in the Applicable
Law which clearly allows such exemption and (b) supplies the Providing Party
with an indemnification agreement, acceptable to the Providing Party, which
holds the Providing Party harmless on an after-tax basis with respect to its
forbearing to collect such Tax.
41.5 Liability for Uncollected Tax, Interest and Penalty.
41.5.1 If the Providing Party has not received an exemption certificate from
the Purchasing Party and the Providing Party fails to bill the
Purchasing Party for any Tax as required by Section 41.1, then, as
between the Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, (a) the
Purchasing Party shall remain liable for such unbilled Tax and any
interest assessed thereon and (b) the Providing Party shall be liable
for any penalty assessed with respect to such unbilled Tax by a taxing
authority.
41.5.2 If the Providing Party properly bills the Purchasing Party for any Tax
but the Purchasing Party fails to remit such Tax to the Providing Party
as required by Section 41.2, then, as between the Providing Party and
Wide Voice Comprehensive Ver3.4b-1-DC.doc 22

the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall be liable for such
uncollected Tax and any interest assessed thereon, as well as any
penalty assessed with respect to such uncollected Tax by the
applicable taxing authority.
41.5.3 If the Providing Party does not collect any Tax as required by Section
41.1 because the Purchasing Party has provided such Providing Party
with an exemption certificate that is later found to be inadequate,
invalid or inapplicable by a taxing authority, then, as between the
Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall
be liable for such uncollected Tax and any interest assessed thereon,
as well as any penalty assessed with respect to such uncollected Tax
by the applicable taxing authority.
41.5.4 If the Purchasing Party fails to pay the Receipts Tax as required by
Section 41.2, then, as between the Providing Party and the
Purchasing Party, (a) the Providing Party shall be liable for any Tax
imposed on its receipts and (b) the Purchasing Party shall be liable for
any interest assessed thereon and any penalty assessed upon the
Providing Party with respect to such Tax by the applicable taxing
authority.
41.5.5 If the Purchasing Party fails to impose and/or collect any Tax from
Subscribers as required by Section 41.3, then, as between the
Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall
remain liable for such uncollected Tax and any interest assessed
thereon, as well as any penalty assessed with respect to such
uncollected Tax by the applicable taxing authority. With respect to any
Tax that the Purchasing Party has agreed to pay, or is required to
impose on and/or collect from Subscribers, the Purchasing Party
agrees to indemnify and hold the Providing Party harmless on an after-
tax basis for any costs incurred by the Providing Party as a result of
actions taken by the applicable taxing authority to recover the Tax
from the Providing Party due to the failure of the Purchasing Party to
timely pay, or collect and timely remit, such Tax to such authority.
41.6 Audit Cooperation. In the event either Party is audited by a taxing authority, the
other Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Party being audited in order to
respond to any audit inquiries in a proper and timely manner so that the audit
and/or any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.
41.7 Notices. All notices, affidavits, exemption-certificates or other communications
required or permitted to be given by either Party to the other, for purposes of this
Section 41, shall be made in writing and shall be delivered in person or sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or registered mail, or a courier service
providing proof of service, and sent to the addressees set forth in Section 29 as

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Verizon shall have the right to
deploy, upgrade, migrate and maintain its network at its discretion. The Parties
acknowledge that Verizon, at its election, may deploy fiber throughout its network and
that such fiber deployment may inhibit or facilitate Wide Voice’s ability to provide service

Wide Voice shall be solely responsible for the cost and activities associated with
accommodating such changes in its own network.

prior written notice of such termination, which shall be effective upon the date
specified in the notice.

to provide any third-persons (including, but not limited to, Customers or contractors of a
Party) with any rights (including, but not limited to, any third-party beneficiary rights)
hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, a Party shall have no liability
under this Agreement to the Customers of the other Party or to any other third person.

solely liable for all costs associated therewith, as well as for any termination charges
associated with the termination of existing Verizon Services.

48. Waiver
A failure or delay of either Party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, or
any right or remedy available under this Agreement or at law or in equity, or to require
performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to exercise any option which is
provided under this Agreement, shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such
provisions, rights, remedies or options.
49. Warranties
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES
OR RECEIVES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE
SERVICES PROVIDED, OR TO BE PROVIDED, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, AND
WARRANTIES ARISING BY TRADE CUSTOM, TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF

50. Withdrawal of Services
50.1 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, except as otherwise
required by Applicable Law, Verizon may terminate its offering and/or provision of
any Service under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Wide Voice.
50.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, except as otherwise
required by Applicable Law, Verizon may with thirty (30) days prior written notice
to Wide Voice terminate any provision of this Agreement that provides for the
payment by Verizon to Wide Voice of compensation related to traffic, including,
but not limited to, Reciprocal Compensation and other types of compensation for
termination of traffic delivered by Verizon to Wide Voice. Following such
termination, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, Verizon shall
be obligated to provide compensation to Wide Voice related to traffic only to the
extent required by Applicable Law. If Verizon exercises its right of termination
under this Section, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith appropriate substitute
provisions for compensation related to traffic; provided, however, that except as
otherwise voluntarily agreed by Verizon in writing in its sole discretion, Verizon
shall be obligated to provide compensation to Wide Voice related to traffic only to
the extent required by Applicable Law. If within thirty (30) days after Verizon’s
notice of termination the Parties are unable to agree in writing upon mutually
acceptable substitute provisions for compensation related to traffic, either Party
may submit their disagreement to dispute resolution in accordance with Section
14 of this Agreement.
