RE: Request for Confidential Treatment to Application of TRUSTID, Inc. for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(G) of
the Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, TRUSTID, Inc.
(“TRUSTID”) hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain
numbering resources.
TRUSTID respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibit A to this application in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive information that falls within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The
information in Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
TRUSTID respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed
Under Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s
rules, TRUSTID hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT PURSUANT TO
47 CFR § 0.459(b)(1).
TRUSTID seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit A in its entirety.

2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(2).
TRUSTID is submitting the confidential agreements between it and its LEC
partner as proof of TRUSTID’s facilities readiness as required by Section
52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which TRUSTID seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors” as defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibit A consists
of commercial agreements between TRUSTID and its LEC partner of which
contain proprietary information concerning TRUSTID’s network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to TRUSTID’s disadvantage. TRUSTID has
numerous competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it operates.
Detailed commercial information on operations of the type provided by
TRUSTID could compromise its position in this highly competitive industry.
Release of this information would therefore result in substantial competitive harm
to TRUSTID.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR
§ 0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use TRUSTID’s proprietary and commercial information to its
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how TRUSTID
provides services as well as about TRUSTID’s commercial agreements with
others in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47
CFR § 0.459(b)(6).
TRUSTID has not distributed the information in Confidential Exhibit A to the
public or any parties within TRUSTID or outside TRUSTID except on a need-to-
know basis.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF

THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(7).
TRUSTID has not previously disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(8).
TRUSTID requests that Confidential Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period
of ten years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information
in Confidential Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT TRUSTID BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(9).
The information concerns TRUSTID’s proprietary network, related to current and
planned operations, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
If you should have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at
your convenience.

PATRICK COX
Patrick Cox is the Senior Vice President and General Manager Product Management, TRUSTID at Neustar,
Inc.
From 2007 - 2018, Patrick was the chairman and CEO of TRUSTID, Inc., a registered telecommunications
carrier in the State of Oregon. TRUSTID authenticates incoming calls for many of the largest financial
services firms in the country. During this period, TRUSTID audited incoming calls in real time to ensure that
the claimed ANI is in fact calling the financial institution.
Drawing on a strong business background and deep technical expertise in telecommunications and
authentication technology, TRUSTID helps customer contact centers of financial institutions and other large
enterprises authenticate their callers more accurately and efficiently.
Before establishing TRUSTID, Cox launched and led two other companies in the authentication, identity and
telecommunications industries. The first, Metro One Telecommunications, a licensed CLEC in many states,
and Cox led the company as CEO from its start-up in 1989 to its initial public offering in 1998. The company
became a billion-dollar market capitalized business which was publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock
exchange. At that time, Metro One was an agent of record for most of the country’s wireless carriers
(including AT&T Wireless, Verizon, Sprint, Southwestern Bell, Ameritech, US West/Quest, and Macaw
Cellular). TRUSTED handled those companies’ 411 and 5551212 traffic.
The second, Qsent, was a provider of telecommunications contact identity services for the financial services
industry; it was successfully sold to a leading global credit bureau. Cox served as Qsent’s Chairman and CEO
from its inception in 1998 through its sale to TransUnion in 2006, at which point he joined TransUnion as an
executive vice president. The company housed MCI's 411 database, and provided telecommunications
services as a CLEC in Oregon.
Cox holds thirty (300) patents in telecommunications and authentication technology and has been certified as
a Class 1 telecommunications engineer by the National Association of Radio and Telecommunicatioins
Engineers for approximately twenty-five (25) years.
He is an alumnus of Stanford University’s Executive Institute for the Management of High-Technology
Companies.
Cox is a member of the following Non-Profit Boards, Organizations, and Committees:
• Young Presidents Organization (YPO - YPOg), a current member and past Chapter Chair
