RE: Request for Confidential Treatment to Application of Simwood, Inc. for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(G) of
the Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Simwood, Inc.
(“Simwood”) hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering
resources.
Simwood respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibit A to this application in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive information that falls within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The
information in Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
Simwood respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed
Under Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s
rules, Simwood hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT PURSUANT TO
47 CFR § 0.459(b)(1).
Simwood seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit A in its entirety.

2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(2).
Simwood is submitting the confidential agreements between it and its LEC
partner as proof of Simwood’s facilities readiness as required by Section
52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which Simwood seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors” as defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibit A consists
of commercial agreements between Simwood and its LEC partner of which
contain proprietary information concerning Simwood’s network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to Simwood’s disadvantage. Simwood has
numerous competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it operates.
Detailed commercial information on operations of the type provided by Simwood
could compromise its position in this highly competitive industry. Release of this
information would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Simwood.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR
§ 0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use Simwood’s proprietary and commercial information to its
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how Simwood
provides services as well as about Simwood’s commercial agreements with others
in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47
CFR § 0.459(b)(6).
Simwood has not distributed the information in Confidential Exhibit A to the
public or any parties within Simwood or outside Simwood except on a need-to-
know basis.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF

THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(7).
Simwood has not previously disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(8).
Simwood requests that Confidential Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period
of ten years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information
in Confidential Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT SIMWOOD BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL
IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY
SHOULD BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(9).
The information concerns Simwood’s proprietary network, related to current and
planned operations, and as such, is commercially sensitive.

your convenience.
