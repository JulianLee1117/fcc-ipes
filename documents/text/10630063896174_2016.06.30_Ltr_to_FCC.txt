Re: COMMIO,LLC, APPLICANT FOR AUTHORIZATION TO OBTAIN NUMBER
RESOURCES PURSUANT TOSECTION 52.15(G)OF THE COMMISSION’S RULES
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52. I 5(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, commio, LLC. hereby submits
additional information to the full application filed on April 25, 2016.
The information includes that after receipt of numbering authorization, commio, LLC intends to
request numbers over time in at least the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado,
Nevada, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Washington.
commio confirms that no foreign governments, individuals, or corporations has 10% or more
ownership of commio, LLC.
In reference to FCC’s Report & Order 15-70 Telephone Number Requirements for IP-Enabled
Services Providers footnote 1311 commio’s Filer 499 ID is 831621, and the current status on
universalservice.org is Active and not in a “red light” status. The term 'entity'2 in Form 477 does
not apply to commio because commio does not currently provide interconnected VoIP service to
revenue-generating end-user customers or have broadband connections in service to an end user,
therefore commio currently is not required to file Form 477 at this time. commio will file Form
477 once the term 'entity' is applicable to commio.
Sam Shiffman, commio’s President, meets the application requirement of providing the
applicant's key technical and management personnel as required by 47 CFR 52.15(g)(3)(i)(F).
Mr. Shiffman is not being and has not been investigated by the FCC, or any law enforcement, or
regulatory agency for failure to comply with any law, rule, or order.
commio, respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
1 Footnote 131 – “Bureau staff will check the applicant’s status under the Commission’s “red light rule,” which
restricts processing of applications filed by parties with outstanding debts owed to the Commission. See 47 C.F.R. §
1.1910. Bureau staff will also verify that the applicant filed its Form 477 and Form 499 forms, if applicable”

CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.11
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by

ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED.16
