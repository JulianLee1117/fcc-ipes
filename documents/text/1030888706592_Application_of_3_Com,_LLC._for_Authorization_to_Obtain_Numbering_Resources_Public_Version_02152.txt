Re: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of 3 Com, LLC.;
Application of 3 Com, LLC. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources, WC Docket No. 20 -
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, 3 Com, LLC. (“3 Com”), hereby
submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via first-class mail.
3 Com respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant
confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a document that contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”).1 3 Com, LLC. is voluntarily providing this information, “of a kind that would
customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under
FOIA.2 Moreover, 3 Com would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 3 Com
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
3 Com, LLC. seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of 3 Com’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules, 3 Com is submitting the agreement between it and its carrier
partner as Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL; OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which 3 Com seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8
Exhibit A describes the agreement between 3 Com and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning the operations and pricing of 3 Com,
LLC. ’s carrier partner and 3 Com’s network, services, and operating costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to 3 Com’s disadvantage. 3 Com has numerous competitors in the Voice
over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations
and commercial information of the type provided by 3 Com could compromise 3 Com’s
position in this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial
competitive harm to 3 Com.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use 3 Com’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
3 Com’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how 3 Com
provides services as well as about 3 Com’s commercial agreements with others in the
market that are not normally disclosed to the public.

6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY
TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
3 Com has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
3 Com has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A to the public or to third
parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
3 Com requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT 3 COM, LLC. BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED.14
The information concerns 3 Com’s proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is commercially
sensitive.
