Re: WC Docket Nos. 13-97, 17-97, 18-124 – Terra Nova Telecom, Inc.
Dear Ms. Arluk:
Our Firm represents Terra Nova Telecom, Inc. (“TNT”). TNT is located in Lakewood Ranch,
Florida. It operates several businesses. It is a Competitive Access Provider (“CAP”), a Competitive
Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”), and an Interconnected VoIP operator (“I-VoIP”). TNT offers I-VoIP
services throughout the Continental United States, including in the state of Louisiana.1 However, all I-
0F
VoIP services are provided on a wholesale basis. TNT has no retail customers.2
1F
As explained below, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (“LPSC”) has conditioned TNTs
request for telephone numbers on submission to state regulation of TNT’s wholesale services. We
respectfully submit that this action exceeds the LPSC’s authority under Part 52 of the rules of the
Commission and is contrary to TNT’s rights as a provider of I-VoIP services and/or as a private carrier.
Therefore, TNT requests the Commission direct the Pooling Administrator (“PA”) to issue the requested
numbers to TNT.
In WC Docket No. 18-124, the Commission granted TNT direct access to telephone numbers
effective July 7, 2018.3 Pursuant to this authority, TNT has requested and received telephone numbers
2F
from the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (“NANPA”) and from the Pooling Administrator
(“PA”). TNT complies with all applicable Commission rules and directives with respect to number
access, including notification to the appropriate state commissions.
1At the present time, TNT serves customers in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge LATAs.
2 To the extent that the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission” or “FCC”) might view TNT’s I-
VoIP operations as carrier services, TNT submits they are all private carrier services. National Ass'n of
Regulatory Util. Comm'rs v. FCC, 525 F.2d 630 (D.C. Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 992 (1976) (“NARUC
I”); National Ass'n of Regulatory Util. Comm'rs v. FCC, 533 F.2d 601 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (“NARUC II”). As
explained below, TNT’s services are not subject to regulation in the manner proposed by the Louisiana
Commission.

Inc.],” 33 FCC Rcd 6493 (2018).

As shown in the Declaration of Michael Ray (Exhibit A), TNT received requests from customers
and prospective customers for numbers in the state of Louisiana, specifically in the Shreveport LATA.
In response, TNT requested numbers from the PA and also notified the LPSC of TNT’s request, as
required. The LPSC, in return, notified TNT that numbers would not be provided to TNT unless TNT
registered with the LPSC as a CLEC. TNT objected and explained that it was not operating as a CLEC in
Louisiana (only in Florida) and, as such, should not be required to register as a CLEC in order to obtain
telephone numbers needed to provide service to TNT’s customers. Later discussions between the LPSC
staff and TNT’s counsel resulted in an altered direction that would require TNT to register as a CAP in
order to obtain access to numbers.
In order to register as a CAP, TNT would be required to fill out and file the LPSC’s “Utility
Registration Form,” Exhibit B. TNT, in the spirit of working constructively with the LPSC, indicated its
willingness to fill out the registration form as a CAP but requested certain waivers or exceptions from
specific requirements that seem more directed to retail service providers. Email message from Robert
Jackson, counsel to TNT, to Don Dewald, Utilities Specialist, LPSC, dated July 7, 2021 (Exhibit C).
Specifically, as a wholesale provider that does not serve end user customers and/or a private carrier,
TNT requested to be excused from providing the information in items 7 (financial, managerial and
technical capacities) and 8 (service description and service maps). Additionally, TNT requested to be
excused from providing an illustrative tariff (item 11) and explanations of how the tariff addresses LPSC
mandates related to the provision of services to retail customers (item 13).
In a July 9, 2021 reply by Mr. Dewald to Mr. Jackson (Exhibit D), the LPSC limited what needed
to be provided. Mr. Dewald confirmed that all information required in item 7 must be provided, along
with a brief history of the applicant and its operations, and a “description of the services to be offered”
(item 8), but excused TNT from providing a service map. TNT was further directed to file an
informational tariff that consists of “terms and conditions of service,” while permitting prices to be
determined on an individual case basis. Certain information identified in item 13 must still be provided.
While TNT appreciates the efforts of the LPSC to narrow its regulatory requirements to fit the
facts, TNT respectfully submits that the FCC’s rules and orders do not permit the LPSC to impose the
above conditions on TNT’s access to telephone numbers authorized in WC Docket No. 18-124. Further,
the requirements exceed those permitted by the FCC for state regulation of I-VoIP services and/or
private carriers.
State commissions have limited authority over telephone numbers and access thereto. The
Commission has delegated to state commissions authority over number reclamation. 47 C.F.R. §
52.15(i). They can access the semi-annual Numbering Resource Utilization/Forecast (“NRUF”) reports,
as well as carriers’ applications for initial and additional number resources. 47 C.F.R. §§ 52.15(f)(7),
(g)(5). This enables state commissions to “discuss with carriers their need for numbers and to object
to number requests” and even to “affirm or overturn a Numbering Administrator’s decision to withhold
numbers from a carrier, and to implement mandatory thousands-block number pooling.” Numbering
Policies for Modern Communications, Report & Order, 30 FCC Rcd 6839, at ¶ 27, n.88 (2015) (“VoIP
Direct Access Order”). See also, 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3)(B)(iv), (g)(4).
The purpose of requiring advance notice for numbering requests was not to confer general
regulatory jurisdiction over I-VoIP providers but rather, to “ensure the integrity of the number
assignment process without needlessly blocking or delaying number assignments to interconnected
VoIP providers.” VoIP Direct Access Order, at ¶ 26. Indeed, the FCC specifically rejected the request
of the Wisconsin Commission to impose other requirements beyond 30-days’ notice and contact
information on VoIP provider obtaining numbering resources. Id. at ¶¶ 42, et seq.

Also, while states can require VoIP providers to pay public interest fund fees and likely enforce
certain consumer protection regulations that apply all businesses, courts have regularly prohibited
broad utility-style regulation of VoIP providers. “[A]ny state regulation of an information service
conflicts with the federal policy of nonregulation." Minnesota Pub. Utilities Comm’n v. FCC, 483 F.3d
570, 580 (8th Cir. 2007); Charter Advanced Servs. (MN), LLC v. Lange, 903 F.3d 715 (8th Cir. 2018). In
Lange, the appeals court affirmed a grant of summary judgment to Charter since its VoIP service was
found to be an information service and not a telecommunications service under federal law.
Also, and to the extent the Commission were to find TNT was a carrier of sorts, it is private
carrier. TNT does not serve retail customers, but only sells its services to other providers that, in turn,
resell TNT’s services to retail customers. Neither does TNT hold itself out to serve all comers. Under
the NorLight decision, TNT is a private carrier. NorLight, Memorandum Opinion & Order, 2 FCC Rcd
5167 (1987). Like NorLight, TNT “negotiate[s] with customers on an individualized basis.” Id. at ¶ 5.
Its contracts are of a longer-term and stable basis like those of NorLight. Id. See also, NARUC I.
Further, the FCC preempted several state regulations as applied to NorLight, including a
restriction on the carrier’s ability to serve customers other than its owners (various electric power
companies), as being an undue burden on interstate services. NorLight, at ¶¶ 16-17. The same
reasoning applies to TNT’s I-VoIP operations in Louisiana. See also, Public Service Company of
Oklahoma Request for Declaratory Ruling, Declaratory Ruling, 3 FCC Rcd. 2327 (1988) (preempting
state entry and rate regulation of private hybrid microwave systems).
Here, tying submission to common carrier regulation to access to telephone numbers negates
TNT’s federal rights to access those numbers granted in the VoIP Direct Access Order, Part 52 of the
FCC’s rules, and WC Docket No. 18-124. Limiting TNT’s access to additional telephone numbers
presents a wall against TNT’s growth in the Louisiana market and constitutes a prohibition against
TNT’s ability to provide intra- and interstate services in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 253(a). It is essentially
a barrier to full market entry condemned by NorLight and PSC of Oklahoma. Similarly, since TNT
serves only sophisticated customers that negotiate individual contracts with TNT, there is no reason for
the LPSC to require access to information about TNT’s financial, managerial and technical capacities.
Each of TNT’s potential customers can adequately investigate those factors before they sign an
agreement for wholesale services.
Finally, the requirement to file a tariff (even as to terms and conditions), which is totally
inconsistent with the right and obligation of a wholesale or private carrier to negotiated individual
contracts with customers, has the effect of unlawfully subjecting TNT to rate regulation, also in
violation of controlling precedent.

In sum, TNT respectfully requests that the Commission direct the PA to assign the requested
telephone numbers to TNT and direct the LPSC to cease and desist from imposing common carrier
regulation on TNT as a condition of TNT’s federal rights to obtain telephone numbers in Louisiana.
Please direct any questions to the undersigned. Thank you.

Communications Commission ("Commission" or "FCC") to direct the Pooling Administrator ("PA") to assign certain telephone
numbers requested by N within the state of Louisiana. If called as a witness in this matter before the Commission, I could
�
and would competentlytestify to the information contained in this Declaration.
!
2. I am the Operations Director at TNT located at 11523 Palm Brush Tri., #401, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34202.
I oversee and direct all aspects of numbering resource assignments as well as its regulatory and engineering departments. I
have worked in the telecommunications industry for 24 years.
3. TNT offers IPES services throughout the Continental United States, including in the state of Louisiana.
4. TNT offers these services only on a wholesale basis to entities which use TNT's service as a component of
their own various servi es sold to end user subscribers. TNT does not sell any services to end user subscribers nor does it
provide any retail services. Neither does TNT hold itself out to the public as a retail provider of telecommunications services
in Louisiana. )
5. All sJrvices are provided by TNT to other entities through individually negotiated contracts that tend to be
longer-term in nature nd on a stable basis. TNT does not experience any regular turnover in its customers.
6. TNT provides service today in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans markets in Louisiana. TNT obtained
numbering resources Jorn the PA under the IPES program in November 2019 for Baton Rouge and in April 2019 for New
Orleans. TNT is currently seeking to serve the Shreveport LATA under the same IPES program, where its resource requests
have been denied.
I dedlare under penalty of perjury under Florida law that the foregoing is true and correct, and that this
Declaration was signed by me on July 16 2021, in Lakewood Ranch, Florida.

Thank you both for the phone conversation and for the written materials.
I’ve been communicating with my Client. We have some questions.
I will assume that Terra Nova Telecom would register as a “competitive access provider” since it
offers only wholesale services and none to end user customers. Some of the questions with respect
to registration do not seem to fit. For example, items 7 and 8 do not seem to fit as they are
seemingly geared to retail providers. Would this information need to be provided? You had
indicated that the Commission was reevaluating its rules as they impact VoIP and wholesale
providers, if I understood you correctly. Could TNT receive a waiver from filing that information?
Also, since TNT does not serve end users, it has no standard price list/tariff. All service agreements
are negotiated individually. Could TNT be exempted from filing items 11 and 13?
Beyond registration, are there any specific regulations or reporting obligations for CAPs? None seem
to fit. Also, I did not see any USF obligations for CAPs, which both makes sense and is consistent
with the FCC’s USF framework. Am I correct?
Is there anything else I am missing?
Thanks much for your help.
Sincerely,
Rob Jackson

Good afternoon Mr. Jackson,
I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. The LPSC is not currently revising its telecom
regulations, but Commission Staff has discussed opening a rulemaking to update the regulations and
also to possibly create a separate application process for VoIP, but this is still preliminary at best. The
documentation in item 7 is required of all applicants as these are used to determine the financial,
technical, and managerial fitness of the company to provide the services being offered. Also, please
include a brief history of the company and list other states where the applicant is authorized to
provide service. For item 8, simply provide a description of the services proposed to be offered. No
need to submit a map in this case.
As for Item 11, we do require all registered TSPs to provide some sort of tariff to keep on file here at
the Commission’s Baton Rouge office. These tariffs are illustrative/informational in nature. In the
case of a CAP, the tariff may consist of terms and conditions of service only. You may also indicate in
the tariff that prices are determined on an individual case basis.
Additionally, we also require that TSPs operating in Louisiana comply with certain General Orders. Of
the relevant orders listed in Item 13, please include provisions in the proposed tariff for: A, B, C D, E,
F, and I as these apply to CAP/VoIP carriers. These cover NSF charges, deposits, late charges, billing
disputes, disconnection for non-payment, and a statement regarding the tariff being governed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of Louisiana. If the company does not have an NSF policy or
does not require a deposit etc., then please indicate in the proposed tariff that the company does
not require these.
Let me know if you have any other questions or require further assistance.
Thanks!
