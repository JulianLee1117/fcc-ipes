DearSecretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, Whisl Telecom, LLC ("Whisl Telecom")
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numberingresources.
Whisl Telecom respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade
secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA").l Whisl Telecom is voluntarily providing this information, "of akind that would not customarily
be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, Whisl
Telecom would suffersubstantial competitive harm ifthis information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLICINSPECTION."
5U.S.c. §552(b)(4).
