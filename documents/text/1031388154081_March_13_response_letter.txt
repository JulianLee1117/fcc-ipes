Re: Docket No. WC 17-62
Application of Megaphone, Inc.
For Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Megaphone, Inc.
(“Megaphone”) respectfully submits the following additional information regarding, and
clarification of, its Application to Obtain Numbering Resources, Docket No. WC 17-62
(“Application”), in response to an inquiry by Commission staff. It also attaches an amended
Application incorporating the corrections and clarifications contained herein.
1. The interconnection agreement Megaphone provided with the Application makes
reference to “termination.” For clarification, this reference is for both inbound and outbound
termination, that is, each of the interconnected carriers can terminate both ends of two-way
communications to each other. The interconnection agreement makes no reference to either
inbound or outbound services, as all services are two-way.
Megaphone and its interconnected carrier have not revised their interconnection
agreement as the current agreement provides for both inbound and outbound call interconnection
and permits completely interconnected two-way communications with the PSTN.
The original Application, however, did contain only a reference to “inbound”
connectivity. This reference was in error and was inadvertent. Accordingly, we have amended
Section I. (D) of the Application to correct this inadvertent reference and correct it to explicitly
state both “inbound” and “outbound.” The corrected sentence now reads –
As proof of its facilities readiness, Megaphone has attached to this application (1)
an interconnection agreement between Megaphone and a carrier partner providing
that the carrier partner will host Megaphone numbers on its switches and provide
PSTN connectivity for both inbound and outbound calls to Megaphone numbers,
and (2) demonstration that Megaphone’s carrier partner maintains Feature Group
D connections with an ILEC and is fully interconnected to the PSTN.

2. We have amended the Application by changing the reference “primarily” on the
second page to state “exclusively.” The statement now reads –
Megaphone will exclusively use numbers to provide voice over Internet protocol
services. Applicant also provides the following information…. (emphasis
provided)
3. We have also amended the Application by including the following statement
immediately before the sentence referenced in point 2, above:
Megaphone is exclusively an interconnected VoIP service provider as defined by
Section 9.3 of the Commission’s Rules, 47 C.F.R. § 9.3.
4. We have amended the Application by providing specific contact information for
each of the Qualified Personnel identified in Section I. (A), and each of the Key Personnel
identified in Section I. (F). Please see the amended Application for this contact detail.
5. In accordance with the strong suggestion contained in footnote 74 of Numbering
Policies for Modern Communications, FCC 15-70 (rel. June 22, 2015), Megaphone clarifies in
the new Exhibit C attached to its amended Application that the initial state in which Megaphone
will be requesting numbers is Massachusetts, but that it may eventually request numbers in all
fifty states. Megaphone acknowledges that it will file with each relevant state commission at
least 30 days before making such requests.
6. Megaphone confirms that it has no foreign ownership.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please contact me with any further
comments or questions.
Very truly yours,
Walter E. Steimel, Jr.
