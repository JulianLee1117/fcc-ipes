Commission'sRules, WCDocketNo. 19-.
DearSecretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15{g)(3)(i) ofthe Commission's Rules, HOC Gamma, LLC ("HOC Gamma") hereby
submits its application requesting authorizationto obtain numberingresources.
HOCGamma respectfully requests that, pursuantto Sections0.457 and 0.459 ofthe Commission's rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom ofInformation Act ("FOIA").l HOC
Gamma is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily be released to
the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, HOC Gamma would
suffersubstantial competitive harm ifthis informationwere disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLICINSPECTION."
