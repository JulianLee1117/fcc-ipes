Re: CallShaper, LLC, Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
& Request for Confidential Treatment, WC Docket No. 19-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
CallShaper, LLC (“CallShaper”) hereby encloses for filing its Application to Obtain
Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit A, an agreement
between CallShaper and its carrier partner (Confidential Exhibit A or “Carrier Agreement”) and
Confidential Exhibit B, an interconnection agreement between CallShaper’s carrier partner and an
incumbent local exchange carrier (Confidential Exhibit B or “Interconnection Agreement”). The
Application, Carrier Agreement, and Interconnection Agreement are sent to you for filing pursuant
to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules. CallShaper respectfully requests that,
pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459,
the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to the Carrier
Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement.
These documents contain trade secrets and commercial, technical and financial information
that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 Exemption 4 of FOIA
provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not apply to matters that are
. . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged
or confidential.”2 CallShaper is voluntarily providing this trade secret and commercial and
financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the public”; therefore,
this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover, CallShaper would
suffer substantial competitive harm if the Carrier Agreement was disclosed and if the identity of
its carrier partner was disclosed by disclosure of the Interconnection Agreement.4

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5
CallShaper states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT6
CallShaper seeks confidential treatment of the Carrier Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit A, and the Interconnection Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit B.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION7
The Carrier Agreement and Interconnection Agreement are being submitted to the
Commission as proof of facilities readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL
OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED8
The information for which CallShaper seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors.”9 The Carrier Agreement and Interconnection Agreement contain trade secrets and
proprietary commercial and technical information relating to the manner in which CallShaper and
its carrier partner conduct network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A
SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION10
The Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement provide detailed information
relating to commercial and operational matters that could be used by competitors to the
disadvantage of CallShaper. Disclosure of CallShaper’s confidential information would cause
substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM11
Competitors could use the information in the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection
Agreement to CallShaper’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive and proprietary
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).
9 47 C.F.R. § 0.457.
10 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4).
11 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5).

information about how CallShaper provides services as well as about CallShaper’s commercial
agreements with others that are not ordinarily disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO
PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE12
CallShaper has made the substance of the Carrier Agreement and the identity of its carrier
partner as disclosed in the Interconnection Agreement known only to those employees who have
a need to know the subject matter and those employees are aware of the confidential and sensitive
nature of the information. The Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement have not
been disclosed by CallShaper to any non-signatories outside CallShaper except pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES13
CallShaper has not previously disclosed the Carrier Agreement or the Interconnection
Agreement.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY
ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE14
CallShaper requests that the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement be
treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature
of the information in the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CALLSHAPER BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED15
Under applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by
CallShaper on a confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of
FOIA shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a person
outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial information
in question clearly satisfies this test.
12 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6).
13 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7).
14 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(8).
15 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(9).
