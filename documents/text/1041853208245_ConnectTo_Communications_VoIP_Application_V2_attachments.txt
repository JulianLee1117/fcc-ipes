ConnectTo Communications, Inc.
Robocall Mitigation Plan
(December 2024)

Introduction
This Robocall Mitigation Plan (RMP) details the reasonable steps and actions taken by ConnectTo
Communications, Inc. (“ConnectTo”) to mitigate and eliminate illegal robocalling. ConnectTo has
implemented STIR/SHAKEN, and has an ongoing commitment to identify and help alleviate illegal
robocalling by pre-qualifying prospective customers, monitoring existing customers for traffic
patterns indicative of prohibited robocalls, and working with other providers and regulatory
agencies in combatting fraudulent voice activity.
All calls that originate on its network are subject to a robocall mitigation program. All telecom
services rely, in part, on ConnectTo’s underlying providers for STIR/SHAKEN implementation and
other robocall mitigation efforts.
The Company is not a foreign voice service provider.
The Company does not sell services to international call originators using North American
Numbering Plan Numbers.
Compliance History
In the past two years, the Company has not been the subject of a formal Commission, law
enforcement, or regulatory agency action or investigation with accompanying findings of actual
or suspected wrongdoing due to the filing entity transmitting, encouraging, assisting, or
otherwise facilitating illegal robocalls or spoofing, or a deficient Robocall Mitigation Database
certification or mitigation program description.
No prior RMD certification has been removed by the Commission. The Company has not been
prohibited from filing in the Robocall Mitigation Database by the Commission.
The person within the Company responsible for addressing all robocall mitigation-related issues,
is:
Name: Aram Ter-Martirosyan
Title: CTO/CIO
Department: IT
Telephone Number: (818) 546-4601
Email Address: aram@connectto.com
STIR/SHAKEN Implementation
ConnectTo has fully implemented the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework across the entire
IP portion of its network, and all calls it originates are compliant with § 64.6301(a)(1) and (2). This
compliance is due, in part, to ConnectTo’s underlying service providers being STIR/SHAKEN
compliant within the IP portions of their networks.

The Company uses a third-party vendor/underlying carrier to sign its calls and ConnectTo has its
own token. ConnectTo does not allow its customers to spoof CallerID, so any outgoing CallerID
can easily be traced back to ConnectTo’s customer.
In addition to analytics provided by its underlying service provider(s), the Company uses a third-
party call analytics vendor, Transnexus. ConnecTo utilizes AI-driven call analytics systems to
monitor and flag suspicious patterns, such as high-volume short-duration calls or calls to
disconnected numbers. Calls flagged as likely illegal are automatically blocked.
Traceback Requests
The Company commits to respond fully within 24 hours to all traceback requests from the
Commission, law enforcement, and the industry traceback consortium, and to cooperate with
such entities in investigating and stopping any illegal robocallers that use its service to originate
calls.
If a traceback exposes an existing customer as the source of fraudulent robocalls, or as having
transmitted fraudulent robocalls, a demand for an explanation and verification of mitigation of
the traffic is issued to the customer. If the fraudulent traffic is not remediated, ConnectTo initiates
blocking of all traffic from the offending customer.
The Company’s point of contact to handle traceback requests is:
Name: Aram Ter-Martirosyan
Title: CTO/CIO
Department: IT
Telephone Number: (818) 546-4601
Email Address: aram@connectto.com
Know Your Customer
ConnectTo has implemented Know Your Customer (KYC) policies when onboarding new or
renewing customers to ensure that such customers and providers do not or are not likely to
engage in any prohibited conduct. Post-onboarding, ConnectTo continuously monitors call traffic
for unusual patterns or violations of its terms of service.
ConnectTo’s KYC practices include:
1. Customer Information: Potential clients must provide government-issued identification,
proof of business registration, contact details, and a valid tax ID.

2. Caller ID Restrictions: Customers are required to use valid, non-spoofed caller IDs. Invalid
or unverified caller IDs are blocked.
3. Payment Limits: Payments are monitored, and suspicious activity, such as unusually large
or frequent transactions, is flagged for review.
4. Ongoing Monitoring: Customer call traffic is continuously analyzed for compliance, and
accounts exhibiting irregular patterns are reviewed.
5. Account Vetting: ConnectTo reviews business use cases to ensure services are used only
for legitimate purposes, terminating accounts if illegal activity is detected.
Additionally, prospects are required to agree to ConnectTo’s strict Acceptable Use Policies (AUP)
prohibiting, among other things, the act of fraudulent voice activity as a condition of doing
business with ConnectTo.
ConnectTo requires all customers to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and its
implementing regulations, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, regulations implementing the FCC’s
national Do-Not-Call registry, and all other rules and regulations governing the sending of
telemarketing calls and/or robocalls.
Telephone Number Validation:
A Telephone Number (“TN”) based caller identity is the originating phone number included in call
signaling used to identify the caller for screening purposes that is uniquely associated with the
subscriber. A subscriber is permitted to use a TN as a caller identity if a TN is directly managed by
ConnectTo and/or obtained by ConnectTo from ConnectTo’s underlying carrier for use by the
subscriber.
For subscribers with multi-line telephone systems, ConnectTo and its underlying provider(s) only
allow calls to be connected if the originating number matches one of the TN’s assigned to the
subscriber. This screening capability enables an automated and secure method of validating
originating telephone numbers.
Ongoing Robocall Mitigation
ConnectTo monitors and examines customer traffic to detect suspicious call activity and/or calling
patterns. When ConnectTo and/or its underlying providers detect network usage patterns
consistent with illegal robocalls or suspect illegal robocalling is taking place, ConnectTo will
immediately seek to identify the party that is originating, terminating, or routing these calls so
that it may take appropriate action. The actions taken may include, but are not limited to,
initiating a traceback investigation; verifying that the originating customer owns or is authorized

to use the Caller ID number; determining whether the Caller ID name sent to a receiving party
matches the customer’s corporate and/or d/b/a name; block (or initiate third-party blocking) the
party’s ability to originate, terminate, or route calls on the network; and/or providing notice to
law enforcement authorities.
As part of its plan to mitigate and prevent any originating robocalls, ConnectTo is committed to
early identification and investigation of possible robocalling conditions. Among other things,
ConnectTo watches for higher-than-normal subscriber traffic volume, including large bursts of
traffic in small timeframes or spikes in usage. ConnectTo also monitors for originating calls of short
duration and low call completion percentages and originating calls with sequential “called to”
number dialing patterns.
Updating ConnectTo’s RMD Submission and RMP
Consistent with FCC Regulations, 47 C.F.R. § 64.6305(d)(5), (e)(5) and (f)(5), ConnectTo will update
its submission in the RMD within 10 business days of any change to the applicable information it
must provide and update in the RMD.
The Company’s RMP continues to develop as the Company and the industry gain expertise and
deploy new robocall mitigation strategies and will be supplemented in future updates.
