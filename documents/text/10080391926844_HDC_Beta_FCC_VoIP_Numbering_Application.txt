C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom ofInformation Act ("FOIA").l HDC
Beta is voluntarily providing this information, "ofa kind that would not customarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIN. Moreover, HDC Beta would suffer
substantial competitive harm ifthis informationweredisclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFORPUBLICINSPECTION."
