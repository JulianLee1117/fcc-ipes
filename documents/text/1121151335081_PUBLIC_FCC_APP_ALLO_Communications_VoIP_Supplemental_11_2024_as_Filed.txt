REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of ALLO Communications LLC; Supplemental
Application of ALLO Communications LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 24-135
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.l5(g)(3)(ii) of the Commission's Rules,1 ALLO Communications LLC ("ALLO
Communications") hereby submits its Supplemental Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources.
ALLO Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibits A and C to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets
and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, ALLO Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.
Exhibits A and C are accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT - NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, ALLO Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
ALLO Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits A and C to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
ALLO Communications is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as
proof of ALLO Communications' facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”

Page 2 of 3
the Commission's Rules. ALLO Communications is submitting as Exhibit C its Service Schedule as
proof that it complies with the 911 and 988 obligations under part 9 of the relevant chapter.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which ALLO Communications seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors".
Exhibit A describes the agreement between ALLO Communications and its carrier partner and
contains proprietary commercial information concerning ALLO Communications' network,
customers, and services. Exhibit C outlines the ALLO Communications compliance with its 911
and 988 obligations which contains contain proprietary information concerning ALLO
Communications network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoIP providers to compromise ALLO Communications’ position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by ALLO Communications could compromise ALLO
Communications' position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this
information would result in substantial competitive harm to ALLO Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use ALLO Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to ALLO Communications’ detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning ALLO Communications’ commercial agreements, as well as information
as to how ALLO Communications provides its services. The prices and terms for the provision of
such services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure
of the Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to ALLO Communications’
carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
ALLO Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibits A or C to the public; ALLO
Communications is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement,
except as expressly authorized by the carrier partner.

Page 3 of 3
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
ALLO Communications does not believe that the Carrier Agreement or Service Schedule is
available to the public or that the Carrier Agreement or Service Schedule has ever been
disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non-disclosure agreement regarding their
contents.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
ALLO Communications requests that Exhibits A and C be withheld from public disclosure
indefinitely. ALLO Communications and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to
remain in effect indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their
substance would cause competitive harm to ALLO Communications’ carrier partner regarding of
the timing of the disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT ALLO COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns ALLO Communications' proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, ALLO Communications respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be
granted confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
The $1485 filing fee has been remitted using the CORES fee payment system.
