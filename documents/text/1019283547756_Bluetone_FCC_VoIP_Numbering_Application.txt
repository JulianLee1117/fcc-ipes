REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Bluetone Communications, LLC; Application of
8/uetone Communications, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to
Section 52.15{g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 20-
Dear Secretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, Bluetone Communications, LLC ("Biuetone")
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
Bluetone respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's rules, 47
C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").1
Bluetone is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily be released to
the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, Bluetone would suffer
substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT -
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
u.s.c.
5 § 552(b)(4).

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules4 , Bluetone
hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.5
Bluetone seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
Bluetone is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier partner, as proof of
Bluetone's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which Bluetone seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors"8 . Exhibit A describes the
agreement between Bluetone and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning Bluetone's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Bluetone's disadvantage. Bluetone has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol ("VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by Bluetone could compromise Bluetone's position in this
highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to
Bluetone.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use Bluetone's proprietary commercial and operational information to
Bluetone's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how Bluetone
provides services as well as about Bluetone's commercial agreements with others in the market
that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Bluetone has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.IZ
Bluetone has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
Bluetone requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period
is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.

9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT BLUETONE BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns Bluetone's proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3006 or
