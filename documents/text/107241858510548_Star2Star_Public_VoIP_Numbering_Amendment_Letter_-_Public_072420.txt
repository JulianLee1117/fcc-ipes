In addition, Star2Star supplements its Application with a copy of its Service Addendum
with its underlying carrier. Please note, this Service Addendum, marked as Supplement Exhibit
A, contains confidential material, the disclosure of which would competitively harm the
Company. Accordingly, Star2Star requests this material be filed under seal, pursuant to §0.459
of the Commission’s Rules.2 In support of this request, Star2Star submits the following:
1. Identification of the information for which confidential treatment is sought.
Star2Star seeks confidential treatment of Supplement Exhibit A to its Application, and
specific references to these exhibits found in the body of its Application.
2. Description of the circumstances giving rise to the submission.
As part of its Application, Star2Star is including the agreement between its carrier
partner as proof of its facilities readiness as required by §52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s Rules, and copies of a number of the carrier’s interconnection agreements
with incumbent carriers. The current Supplement Exhibit A is a Service Addendum to
Star2Star’s agreement with its carrier partner.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
The information for which Star2Star seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.”
Supplement Exhibit A to this Application describes the agreement between Star2Star
and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial information concerning
Star2Star’s network, customers, financing, and services.

4. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
Supplement Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be
used by other interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) providers to
compromise Star2Star’s position in the highly competitive interconnected VoIP sector.
Accordingly, release of this information would result in substantial competitive harm to
Star2Star.
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial competitive
harm.
Competitors could use Star2Star’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
Star2Star’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning
Star2Star’s commercial agreements, as well as information as to how Star2Star provides
its services. This information is not typically disclosed publicly.
6. Identification of any measures taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure, or if the
information has been disclosed previously.
Neither Star2Star nor its carrier-partner have distributed the information to the public or
to any third party.
7. Justification of the period during which Star2Star asserts that material should not be
available for public disclosure.
Star2Star requests that Supplement Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a minimum
period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the nature of the proprietary
information in the Supplement Exhibit A of the Application.
Two copies of this filing with the confidential information included are being submitted
concurrently via overnight courier.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter and please do not hesitate to contact me at
(202) 792-6422, or kmarshall@potomaclaw.com if you have any questions or concerns.
Respectfully submitted,
Katherine Barker Marshall, Counsel to Star2Star Communications, LLC
