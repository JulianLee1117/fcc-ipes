3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS

The information for which RGTN seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial

CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A and B contain information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors toRGTN’s disadvantage. RGTNhas numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by RGTN could compromise RGTN’s position in this highly
competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm toRGTN.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use RGTN’s proprietary commercial and operational information to RGTN’s
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how RGTN provides services

PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR

RGTN requests that Exhibit A and B be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
periodis necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information inExhibit A and B.
