b) AT&T reserves the right to change from time to time the rates for Services under this Agreement,
regardless of any provisions that would otherwise stabilize rates or limit rate increases, to reasonably
reflect charges or payment obligations imposed on AT&T stemming from an order, rule or regulation
of the Federal Communications Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, or any other

(ii) universal service fund ("USF") charges, (iii) presubscribed interexchange carrier charges

5. AT&T Voice Over IP Connect Service – 1+ Outbound Direct, Domestic Native IP Traffic.
a) Connectivity and Facilities. The required connectivity to AVOICS is described in
Exhibit A to this Attachment."
b) Native Transport
i) The effective monthly transport rate for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP calls will be
determined each month by applying the applicable Native Transport Discount to the Native Base
Transport Rate depending on whether the call is made during a peak or off-peak period.
ii) Each transport discount consists of a specific discount for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic
Native IP calls made during a peak period and a specific discount for AVOICS – 1+ OD
Domestic Native IP calls made during an off-peak period (“Native Transport Discount”), as set
forth in the table below. The peak rate applies from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday
(excluding the following United States holidays: New Year’s Day; Memorial Day; Independence
Day; Labor Day; Thanksgiving Day; and Christmas Day), and the off-peak rate applies for all
other time periods. The applicable time period will be determined based on the time at the AT&T
Network through which the call is originated. When a call occurs in more than one rate period,
the rate for each rate period applies to the portion of the call within that rate period.
iii) Only one Native Transport Discount shall be applied to the monthly Native Base Transport
Rate for the entire month’s Native Transport usage, and the Native Transport Discount shall not
apply to any other charges. The applicable Native Transport Discount will be determined based
on the amount of Native Qualified Usage billed in that month. Native Qualified Usage consists
of the total domestic minutes of use for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP Services.

c) Native Termination Rates. The Native Termination Rates are set forth in the Native Termination
Rate Schedule. The Native Termination Rate Schedule is set forth in the following file (the
“Termination Rate File”):
Termination Rate File Name: Victory Telecom Termination Rate File 110428.xls
AT&T will use the Local Routing Number (“LRN”) for the call record associated with the call to
determine the OCN where the call will be terminated. However, for determining the jurisdiction of
the call, if the terminating LRN is in a different state from the dialed number, AT&T will use the
dialed number.
i) Customer acknowledges that it has received the Native Termination Rate Schedule from AT&T
prior to the Effective Date of this Attachment. Although the rates in the Native Termination Rate
Schedule are set forth as per minute rates, the Native Termination Rates are billed in periods of
six (6) seconds. The applicable rate for each six (6) seconds (or fraction thereof) will be ten
percent (10%) of the per minute rate set forth in the Native Termination Rate Schedule. No
discounts are applied to the Native Termination Rates.
ii) Interstate and Intrastate Rates. The Native Termination Rate Schedule contains separate
interstate and intrastate rates. The intrastate rates apply if the call originates and terminates
within the same State (including local calls); the interstate rates apply if the call originates in one
State (or the District of Columbia) and terminates in a domestic location that is not in the same
State. The location from which a call originates and terminates will be determined as described
in the following table:
Type of Call Originating Location based on Termination Location based on
AVOICS – 1+ OD Native IP Calling Party Number (“CPN”) * Local Routing Number (“LRN”)**
* Upon at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice to Customer, AT&T may change order of
preference for identifying the originating location to use the first valid instance of either the
Jurisdictional Identification Parameter (“JIP”), Charge Number/Automatic Number Identification
(ANI) or the Trunk Routing Number – 2 (TRN2) for the call record associated with each call.
** If there is a LRN for a call, AT&T will use the LRN for the call record associated with the call to
determine the State, LATA, and OCN where the call will be terminated. However, for determining the
jurisdiction of the call, if the terminating LRN is in a different state from the dialed number, AT&T will use
the dialed number. Upon at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice to Customer, AT&T may change the
basis for identifying the terminating location to some other approach designed to identify the location of the
called party.

If a valid CPN is not reflected in the call record (“CPN-less Call”), the Originating
Location will be based on the Secondary Trunk Rating Number (“TRN2”) of the
customer site. The customer site is the location of the CPE (e.g., soft switch, gateway) to
which the Native and Non-native pair of IP signaling addresses provided by the Customer
are provisioned and from which the call is delivered to the AVOICS network. The TRN2
will be a NPA/NXX used to represent the geographic location of the customer site.
iii) Native Termination Rate Adjustments. Except as otherwise provided in this Attachment, the
Native Termination Rate Schedule will be adjusted twice each year and the changes will be
effective with March and September usage (for calls rated after the revised rates are
implemented). Supplemental Native Termination Rates may be provided more frequently to
introduce new rates (e.g., for new OCNs or in the event of a LATA split or consolidation).
iv) When at the time of rating, a new State/LATA/OCN combination has been introduced in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (“LERG”), but not added to the biller rate table, the termination
rate for calls to the new State/LATA/OCN combination will be the lowest rate in the termination
rate file, based on jurisdiction (i.e. Interstate/Intrastate). Any special rates stated in this
Attachment will be excluded.
v) When at the time of rating, a new State/LATA/OCN combination has been introduced in the
LERG and has been added to the biller rate table, the termination rate used for the new
OCN/State/LATA combination will be the standard termination rate of the Bell Operating
Company in the biller for the State/LATA where the new State/LATA/OCN combination is
operating. If a Bell Operating Company is not operating in that State/LATA, then the dominant
carrier termination rate in that State/LATA will be used.
d) Special Wireless and PCS Termination Rates. Customer will be charged a Special Termination
Rate of $.0040 for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP calls for Wireless Terminations and for
PCS Terminations, as reflected in the Native Termination Rate Schedule. Wireless Termination and
PCS Terminations are defined as termination to Operating Company Numbers classified as Wireless
and PCS in LERG 1 table and in LERG 6 NPA/NXX "A” Block, at the effective date of most
current Termination Rate File, or other publicly available information that may replace the LERG 1
table as mutually agreed upon between Customer and AT&T. AT&T may at any time during the
Term of this Attachment and at its sole discretion adjust the Special Wireless and PCS Termination
Rates for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP calls upon at least seven (7) days prior written notice
to Customer. Any such revised rates will be effective for calls rated after the revised rates are
implemented. If AT&T exercises this right and increases the Native Net Effective Rate above
$.0040, the MRC for the remainder of the Term will be waived.
e) Special Targeted Wireless Termination Rates. Customer will be charged a Special Targeted
Wireless Termination Rate of $.0040 for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP calls for Targeted
Wireless OCNs, as reflected in the following file (the "Targeted Wireless OCN File"):

prior to the Effective Date of this Attachment. AT&T may at any time during the Term of this
Attachment and at its sole discretion change the Targeted Wireless OCNs upon at least seven (7)
days prior written notice to Customer.
(ii) AT&T may at any time during the Term of this Attachment and at its sole discretion adjust
the Special Targeted Wireless Termination Rate for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native IP calls
upon at least seven (7) days prior written notice to Customer. Any such revised rates will be

address this billing inflexibility, AT&T will apply a discount to the Native Termination Rate Schedule for
the targeted State/LATA/OCN terminations identified in the Target Terminations File below, so that the
rate paid by the Customer is equal the following "Native Net Effective Rate" (discounted Native Base
Transport Rate plus Native Termination Rate).

6. AT&T Voice Over IP Connect Service – 1+ Outbound Direct, Domestic Non-native IP Traffic.
a) Connectivity and Facilities. The required connectivity to AVOICS is described in
Exhibit A to this Attachment.
b) Non-native Transport
(i) The effective monthly transport rate for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-native IP calls will
be determined each month by applying the applicable Non-native Transport Discount to the Non-
native Base Transport Rate depending on whether the call is made during a peak or off-peak
period.
(ii) Each transport discount consists of a specific discount for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-
native IP calls made during a peak period and a specific discount for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic
Non-native IP calls made during an off-peak period (“Non-native Transport Discount”), as set
forth in the table below. The peak rate applies from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday
(excluding the following United States holidays: New Year’s Day; Memorial Day; Independence
Day; Labor Day; Thanksgiving Day; and Christmas Day), and the off-peak rate applies for all
other time periods. The applicable time period will be determined based on the time at the AT&T
Network through which the call is originated. When a call occurs in more than one rate period,
the rate for each rate period applies to the portion of the call within that rate period.
(iii)Only one Non-native Transport Discount shall be applied to the monthly Non-native Base
Transport Rate for the entire month’s Non-native Transport usage, and the Non-native Transport
Discount shall not apply to any other charges. The applicable Non-native Transport Discount
will be determined based on the amount of Non-native Qualified Usage billed in that month.
Non-native Qualified Usage consists of the total domestic minutes of use for AVOICS – 1+ OD
Domestic Non-native IP Services.

c) Non-native Termination Rates. The Non-native Termination Rates are set forth in the Non-
Native Termination Rate Schedule. The Non-Native Termination Schedule is set forth in
Termination Rate File.
AT&T will use the Local Routing Number (“LRN”) for the call record associated with the call to
determine the OCN where the call will be terminated. However, for determining the jurisdiction of
the call, if the terminating LRN is in a different state from the dialed number, AT&T will use the
dialed number.
i) Customer acknowledges that it has received the Non-native Termination Rate Schedule from
AT&T prior to the Effective Date of this Attachment. Although the rates in the Non-native
Termination Rate Schedule are set forth as per minute rates, the Non-native Termination Rates are
billed in periods of six (6) seconds. The applicable rate for each six (6) seconds (or fraction thereof)
will be ten percent (10%) of the per minute rate set forth in the Non-native Termination Rate
Schedule. No discounts are applied to the Non-native Termination Rates.
(ii) Interstate and Intrastate Rates. The Non-native Termination Rate Schedule contains separate
interstate and intrastate rates. The intrastate rates apply if the call originates and terminates
within the same State (including local calls); the interstate rates apply if the call originates in one
State (or the District of Columbia) and terminates in a domestic location that is not in the same
State. The location from which a call originates and terminates will be determined as described
in the following table:
Type of Call Originating Location based on Termination Location based on
AVOICS – 1+ OD Non-native IP Calling Party Number (“CPN”) * Local Routing Number “LRN”)**
* Upon at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice to Customer, AT&T may change order of
preference for identifying the originating location to use the first valid instance of either the
Jurisdictional Identification Parameter (“JIP”), Charge Number/Automatic Number Identification
(ANI) or the Trunk Routing Number – 2 (TRN2) for the call record associated with each call.
** If there is a LRN for a call, AT&T will use the LRN for the call record associated with the call
to determine the State, LATA, and OCN where the call will be terminated. However, for
determining the jurisdiction of the call, if the terminating LRN is in a different state from the
dialed number, AT&T will use the dialed number. Upon at least ten (10) days’ prior written
notice to Customer, AT&T may change the basis for identifying the terminating location to some
other approach designed to identify the location of the called party.

For CPN-less Call, the Originating Location will be based on the TRN2 of the customer
site. The customer site is the location of the CPE (e.g., soft switch, gateway) to which
the Native and Non-native pair of IP signaling addresses provided by the Customer are
provisioned and from which the call is delivered to the AVOICS network. The TRN2
will be a NPA/NXX used to represent the geographic location of the customer site.
(iii)Non-native Termination Rate Adjustments. Except as otherwise provided in this Attachment,
the Non-native Termination Rate Schedule will be adjusted twice each year and the changes will
be effective with March and September usage (for calls rated after the revised rates are
implemented). Supplemental Non-native Termination Rates may be provided more frequently to
introduce new rates (e.g., for new OCNs or in the event of a LATA split or consolidation).
iv) When at the time of rating, a new State/LATA/OCN combination has been introduced in the
LERG, but not added to the biller rate table, the termination rate for calls to the new
State/LATA/OCN combination will be the lowest rate in the termination rate file, based
on jurisdiction (i.e. Interstate/Intrastate). Any special rates stated in this Attachment will be
excluded.
v) When at the time of rating, a new State/LATA/OCN combination has been introduced in the
LERG and has been added to the biller rate table, the termination rate used for the new
State/LATA/OCN combination will be the standard termination rate of the Bell Operating
Company in the biller for the State/LATA where the new State/LATA/OCN combination is
operating. If a Bell Operating Company is not operating in that State/LATA, then the dominant
carrier termination rate in that State/LATA will be used.
d) Special Wireless and PCS Termination Rates. Customer will be charged a Special Termination
Rate of $.0040 for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-native IP calls for Wireless Terminations and
for PCS Terminations, as reflected in the Non-native Termination Rate Schedule. Wireless
Termination and PCS Terminations are defined as termination to Operating Company Numbers
classified as Wireless and PCS in LERG 1 table and in LERG 6 NPA/NXX "A” Block, at the
effective date of most current Termination Rate File, or other publicly available information that may
replace the LERG 1 table as mutually agreed upon between Customer and AT&T. AT&T may at any
time during the Term of this Attachment and at its sole discretion adjust the Special Wireless and PCS
Termination Rates for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-native IP calls upon at least seven (7) days
prior written notice to Customer. Any such revised rates will be effective for calls rated after the
revised rates are implemented.
e) Special Targeted Wireless Termination Rates. Customer will be charged a Special Targeted
Wireless Termination Rate of $.0040 for AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-native IP calls for
Targeted Wireless OCNs, as reflected in the Targeted Wireless OCN File. AT&T may at any time
during the Term of this Attachment and at its sole discretion change the Targeted Wireless OCNs
upon at least seven (7) days prior written notice to Customer.

Effective Date of this Attachment. Although the rates in the International Rate File are set forth
as per minute rates, the International Rates for AVOICS – International OD (for all countries
except Mexico, the AT&T Maritime Mobile Services and the AT&T Commercial Satellite
Mobile Services including INMARSAT, Iridium and Thuraya) are billed with an initial increment
of eighteen (18) seconds, and additional increments of six (6) seconds. The rate for the initial
(18) second period or fraction thereof will be thirty percent (30%) of the per minute rate set forth
in the International Rate File and the rate for each additional six (6) second increment or fraction
thereof will be ten percent (10%) of the per minute rate. A separate Rate may apply when
AVOICS – International OD is used to call a foreign mobile telephone number or to make an

i) The Average Length of Call (ALOC) for all AVOICS usage (AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Native
IP, AVOICS – 1+ OD Domestic Non-native IP and AVOICS – International OD) must be at least one
(1) minute. The ALOC will be determined at the end of each six (6) month anniversary of the Term
Start Date (“Review Period”) based upon the usage during the prior six (6) months. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, AT&T shall have the option of accelerating the Review Period to determine the ALOC
at the end of the third (3rd) and ninth (9th) month anniversaries of the Term Start Date, based upon the
usage during the prior three (3) months, if the ALOC during such period is below seventy-five
percent (75%) of the ALOC specified above.
ii) At the end of each Review Period, if Customer fails to satisfy the ALOC of at least one (1)
minute, then AT&T reserves the right to change the rates to address the missed ALOC.
iii) Before executing this right and after AT&T has notified Customer in writing that the ALOC has
not been satisfied, Customer and AT&T will negotiate in good faith for a period no longer than thirty
(30) days with the intent of reaching mutual agreement on a remedy. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement within thirty (30) days then AT&T shall have the right to revise the rates.
iv) Notwithstanding Sections 9(a), (b) and (c) above, if AT&T determines that the ALOC during any
Review Period is below seventy-five percent (75%) of the ALOC specified above in Section 9(a),

v) If the ALOC during any two (2) Review Periods during a twelve (12) month period is below
seventy-five percent (75%) of the ALOC specified above in Section 9(a), AT&T may terminate
AVOICS for such upon five (5) days written notice to Customer. Any termination of Service
pursuant to this provision will not excuse Customer from its obligations under Section 3 (Minimums)
of this Attachment.
b) Impermissible Traffic
i) AT&T will monitor Customer’s AVOICS traffic to verify that no Impermissible Traffic is
being terminated over AVOICS. If AT&T determines that Impermissible Traffic is being
terminated over AVOICS, AT&T will provide written notice to Customer (“Impermissible
Traffic Notice”). If within five (5) days after receiving an Impermissible Traffic Notice
from AT&T, Customer continues to terminate Impermissible Traffic, then AT&T may suspend
AVOICS until such time as Customer has provided adequate assurances to AT&T that
Impermissible Traffic will not be terminated over AVOICS. If adequate assurances are not
provided to AT&T within thirty (30) days of the date of AT&T’s notice to Customer, then AT&T
may terminate Service. If Service is resumed and subsequently AT&T determines that
Impermissible Traffic is being terminated over AVOICS, within ninety (90) days of the date
Customer receives the Impermissible Traffic Notice, or if three (3) Impermissible Traffic
Notices are issued within a twelve (12) month period, AT&T may suspend or terminate
AVOICS upon twenty (24) hours prior written notice to Customer. Any suspension of service
pursuant to this provision will not excuse Customer from its obligations under Section 3
(Minimum Revenue Commitments) of this Attachment. Termination of Service by AT&T will be
considered due to Customer’s breach of this Attachment.
ii) “Impermissible Traffic” is calls resulting from the following activities:
A. Sequential dialing of telephone numbers at the NPA or NXX level;
B. Initiating a call, as a result of a party receiving a telemarketing or telephone
solicitation responding to a prompt, and signaling the CPN of the called party, unless the
called party had an existing business relationship with the telemarketer or telephone
solicitor;
C. Passing a telephone number not associated with the calling party as a means to obtain
name and number information for the improperly passed telephone number;
D. Cause any caller identification service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller
identification information, with the intent to defraud or cause harm;
E. Place calls for the primary purpose of generating queries to a CNAM database;
F. Calling a party in violation of any state or federal statutes or government regulations,
including, but not limited to, those applicable to telemarketers and telephone solicitations

10. Customer Commitments
a) Customer represents and warrants that each call originated to AT&T as Native IP traffic, meets
the criteria defined as (i) traffic that originates as IP from the originating caller, and (ii) is then
transported as IP from the Service Provider to AT&T.
b) If AT&T determines that Non-native traffic is routed or has been routed by the Customer to
AT&T via the Native IP circuits, (i) Customer must remove the traffic within twenty-four (24) hours
from the time of notification by AT&T, (ii) AT&T will re-rate the traffic as Non-native traffic, (iii)
Customer will be billed the re-rated amount for payment to AT&T, and (iv) Customer will also pay
any additional charges to AT&T, including but not limited to; fines, penalties, surcharges,
administrative costs. If Customer repeatedly routes Non-native traffic to AT&T via the Native IP
circuits, AT&T may terminate this Attachment upon at least ten (10) days written notice to Customer.
c) Customer further agrees that Customer will not intentionally manipulate its routing system in a
fashion that results in the delivery of a disproportionate amount of traffic that terminates in high-cost
areas (i.e., in areas where a terminating Local Exchange Carrier’s (“LEC”) rate for terminating traffic
is higher than the rate AT&T charges Customer).
d) As described in the AVOICS Service Description, Customer is obligated to include calling party
number (“CPN”) with all calls. AT&T reserves the right to add an additional Termination Rate File
to this Attachment if calls are sent without CPN or to use the geographically significant NPA-NXX of
the Customer Router location as the location from which a call originates.

Exhibit A
to
AT&T Voice Over IP Connect Service (AVOICS)
Service Terms and Pricing Attachment
Transport Independent Access (TIA)
Customer will use TIA for connectivity to AVOICS rather than MIS-PNT as required in the
AVOICS Service Description. There are no additional charges for this option.
1. With TIA, the Customer and AT&T will work in good faith to determine the initial limit
on Concurrent Calls (“Concurrent Call Limit”) during the Technical Due Diligence
(“TDD”) process. Concurrent Calls are defined as the number of call sessions active at
any one time. Call attempts made from any given TIA Site when the number of
Concurrent Calls exceeds the Concurrent Call Limit for that TIA Site will be rejected.
The Concurrent Call Limit will be initially allocated equally over the number of
Customer TIA Sites, unless agreed to otherwise by Customer and AT&T. A TIA Site is
defined as a Native and Non-native pair of IP signaling addresses provided by the
Customer. With prior written notice, AT&T may increase or decrease the Concurrent
Call Limit based on the minutes of use being delivered
2. Although AT&T will use reasonable efforts to accept calls up to the Concurrent Call
Limit for a TIA Site, the number of Concurrent Calls the customer may achieve is
dependent upon other factors, including network and resource availability at the moment
of a call attempt. Therefore, AT&T does not guarantee that the customer will always be
able to reach the Concurrent Call Limit for Customer’s AVOICS traffic.
3. Customer is responsible for delivering calls to the AT&T Network. Such connectivity
can be either thru public internet access or by using MIS ports acquired under a separate
AT&T MIS Wholesale Pricing Schedule.
4. Customer is responsible to provision the IP addresses used at the TIA Sites.
5. Customer is required to utilize separate, dedicated IP addresses as the source signaling
address for Native IP Traffic and Non-native IP Traffic.
6. AT&T will provision the Customer provided IP addresses in the AT&T network
elements.
