Re: Business Telecommunications Services, Inc., Second Supplement to the Application, Application for
Authority to Obtain Direct Access to Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 20-166
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Business Telecommunications Services, Inc. (“BTS”), by its counsel and pursuant to section
52.15(g)(3)(i) of the rules of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC” or “Commission”),
submits this additional agreement (“Agreement”) as a Second Supplement its previously filed application
requesting authority to directly obtain numbering resources from the North American Numbering Plan
Administrator and the Pooling Administrator (“Application”).1 BTS respectfully requests that the
Commission consider this Agreement in reviewing and granting the pending Application.
BTS’s pending Application requests authorization to provide service in the area(s) for which the
numbering resources are requested, and a grant of the Application would constitute such authority.2 At the
request of the Wireline Competition Bureau (“Bureau”), BTS filed a Supplement to its Application on
September 30, 2020.3 Since that Supplement, BTS completed an additional Service Order with its carrier
partner, Service Order – PSTN Control Service, to originate and terminate traffic to and from the Public
Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”). BTS now submits that Agreement for the Bureau’s review as
1 See Business Telecommunications Services, Inc., Application for Authority to Obtain Direct Access to
Numbering Resources Pursuant to 52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 20-166 (filed Jun.
11, 2020) (“BTS Application”).

Numbering Resources Pursuant to 52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules, Supplement to Application, WC

Ms. Marlene H. Dortch

further evidence of its ability to provide service within 60 days of the numbering resources activation date.4

Please direct any questions as to this matter to the undersigned.
Respectfully Submitted,
