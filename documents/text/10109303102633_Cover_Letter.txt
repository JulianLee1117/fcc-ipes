Re: Vision CTS, LLC
2nd Revised Numbering Authorization Application
Docket No. WC 17-288
Dear Ms. Dortch,
This 2nd Revised filing of the Numbering Authorization Application of Vision CTS, LLC includes an
amended Exhibit C, which is a more extensive version of the Interconnection Agreement (“ICA”)
between AT&T and Vision CTS, LLC. The initial filing’s Exhibit C included a more condensed version
of the ICA. Staff has asked for these additional pages of the ICA for their review.
Also, please note that the previously filed 1st Revised filing of the Numbering Authorization Application
of Vision CTS, LLC was mistakenly dated October 18, 2017, when in fact the 1st Revised filing was filed
on October 30, 2017. If any additional information is needed, please let me know.
Respectfully,
/s/ Matt W. Dean
