RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of E. Ritter Communications, LLC DBA Ritter
Communications and DBA RightFiber; Supplement to the Application of E. Ritter
Communications, LLC DBA Ritter Communications and DBA RightFiber for Authorization to
Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket
No. 25-154
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.l5(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 E. Ritter Communications, LLC DBA Ritter
Communications and DBA RightFiber ("Ritter Communications") hereby submits its supplement to the
Application for Authorization (“Application”) to Obtain Numbering Resources originally submitted on
March 21, 2025 in the above mentioned docket number.
Ritter Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment
to Exhibit A to the supplement to the application because the documents contain sensitive trade secrets
and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, Ritter Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.
Exhibit A of the supplement is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT - NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, Ritter Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
Ritter Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the supplement to
Application.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”

2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
Ritter Communications is submitting as Exhibit A to the supplement to Application, additional
information in compliance with §52.12(g)(3)(ii)(E).
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which Ritter Communications seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A of the
supplement to Application includes a Statement of Work and Master Service Agreement that are
proprietary and confidential in nature and should not be disclosed to the public.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A to the supplement of Application contains information relating to commercial matters
which can be used by other interconnected VoIP providers to compromise Ritter Communications’
position in the highly competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and
commercial information of the type provided by Ritter Communications could compromise Ritter
Communications’ position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this
information would result in substantial competitive harm to Ritter Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use Ritter Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to Ritter Communications' detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning Ritter Communications’ commercial agreements, as well as information
as to how Ritter Communications provides its services. Therefore, disclosure of the Statement of
Work or Master Service Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to Ritter
Communications. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
Ritter Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the supplement to the
Application to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
Ritter Communications does not believe that the Statement of Work or Master Service Agreement
is available to the public or that this information has ever been disclosed to third parties absent
the protection of a non-disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
Ritter Communications requests that Exhibit A of the supplement to the application be withheld
from public disclosure indefinitely. Disclosure of the Statement of Work or Master Service
Agreement or their substance would cause competitive harm to Ritter Communications.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT RITTER COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns Ritter Communications' proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, Ritter Communications respectfully requests that Exhibit A to the supplement
to the application be granted confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
