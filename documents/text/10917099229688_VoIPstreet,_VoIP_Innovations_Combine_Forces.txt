PITTSBURGH, March 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Two Pittsburgh-based VoIP providers, VoIPstreet and VoIP
Innovations, have come together to create an all-in-one VoIP solutions provider that offers both retail and
wholesale VoIP services and boasts one of the nation's largest networks.
VoIPstreet will keep its name on the group's retail solutions due to a well-established presence and track
record within the industry, but will officially be under the VoIP Innovations umbrella.
VoIP Innovations already boasted one of the largest nationwide networks in the industry. Now that
VoIPstreet is offering its retail services under the VoIP Innovations moniker, that already robust, fully
redundant network swells to more than 7,500 rate centers across the contiguous U.S.
"We think this move makes a lot of sense for both companies," said VoIP Innovations Product Manager and
former VoIPstreet President Jason Tapolci. "We get to leverage the unique brands, service offerings and
infrastructure to create a one of a kind world-class network. We really feel like this is an excellent
opportunity for both businesses."
VoIP Innovations, a wholesale Voice-over-Internet-Protocol provider with more than 20 years in the
industry, offers U.S. and toll-free inbound calling and U.S. and International outbound to VoIP service
providers. VoIPstreet, with more than 10 years experience in the retail VoIP market, offers cost-reducing SIP
Trunking and metered VoIP solutions for businesses of all sizes.

The move casts VoIP Innovations as a major player in the continually growing VoIP industry.
