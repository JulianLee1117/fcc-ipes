Dear Ms. Dortch:
Following discussion with Commission Staff, AM Communication Labs, Inc. (“AM Comm”)
hereby supplements its December 23, 2024 Supplement 1 to its Application for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources (“Application”) with respect to Exhibit D.
At Staff’s request, AM Comm is withdrawing its request for confidential treatment of Exhibit D.
I have enclosed a revised Application removing the “Confidential” reference to Exhibit D and the
updated exhibit reflecting the same.
Please contact me with any questions or concerns regarding this matter.
