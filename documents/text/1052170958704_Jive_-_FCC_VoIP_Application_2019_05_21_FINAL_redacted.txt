Re: Jive Communications LLC, Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources & Request for Confidential Treatment, WC Docket No. 19-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Jive Communications LLC (“Jive”) hereby encloses for filing its Application to Obtain
Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit 1, an
interconnection agreement between Jive’s carrier partner and a local exchange carrier
(“Interconnection Agreement”). The Application and Interconnection Agreement are sent to you
for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
Jive respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to the Interconnection Agreement. This document contains trade secrets
and commercial, technical and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom
of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 Jive is voluntarily providing this trade secret and
commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover,
Jive would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Interconnection Agreement were
disclosed.4
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5 Jive
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).

TREATMENT IS SOUGHT6
Jive seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit 1, an interconnection agreement
between Jive’s carrier partner and a local exchange carrier (“Interconnection Agreement”).
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION7
The Interconnection Agreement is being submitted to the Commission in conformity with
the referenced docket number.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED8
The information for which Jive seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors.”9 The Interconnection Agreement contains trade secrets and technical information
relating to the manner in which Jive and its carrier partner conduct network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION10
The Interconnection Agreement contains detailed information relating to operational
matters that could be used by competitors to the disadvantage of Jive. Disclosure of Jive’s
confidential information would cause substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM11
Competitors could use the information in the Interconnection Agreement to Jive’s
detriment.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE12
Jive has made the substance of the Interconnection Agreement known only to those
employees who have a need to know the subject matter and those employees are aware of the
confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The Interconnection Agreement has not

been disclosed by Jive to any non-signatories outside Jive except pursuant to appropriate
confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES13
Jive has not previously disclosed the Interconnection Agreement to the public.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE14
Jive requests that the Interconnection Agreement be treated as confidential for a period of
ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in the
Interconnection Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT JIVE BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER
ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED15
The disclosure of the names of Jive’s carrier partner and interconnecting local exchange
carrier could be used to the competitive detriment of Jive.
Respectfully submitted,
