Re: WC Docket No. 17-219
Request for Confidential Treatment for Supplement to Application of One Ring Networks, Inc.
For Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, One Ring Networks, Inc.
(“One Ring”) hereby submits this Supplement to its application requesting authorization to obtain
numbering resources.
One Ring respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and
treatment Exhibit 2 to this application as confidential because that document contains sensitive
trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of
Information Act (“FOIA”).1 The information in Exhibit 2 is “of a kind that would not
customarily be released to the public,” therefore, this information qualified for confidential
treatment under FOIA.2 One Ring respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial
competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit 2 is accordingly marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 See Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See National Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

Ms. Marlene H. Dortch

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4
One Ring hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT5
One Ring seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit 2 to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION6
One Ring is submitting the Confidential agreement between it and its carrier partner, as proof of
One Ring’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s
rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED7
The information for which One Ring seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.”8 Exhibit 2 consists of a
commercial agreement between One Ring and its carrier partner and contains proprietary
commercial information concerning One Ring’s network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION9
Exhibit 2 contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to One Ring’s disadvantage. One Ring has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by One Ring could compromise One Ring’s position in this
highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to
One Ring.
4 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.457(d)(2).
9 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4).

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use One Ring’s proprietary commercial and operational information to One
Ring’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how One Ring
provides services as well as about One Ring’s commercial agreements with others in the market
that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE11
One Ring has not distributed the information in Exhibit 2 to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES12
One Ring has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit 2.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE13
One Ring requests that Exhibit 2 be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period
is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit 2.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT ONE RING BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED14
The information concerns One Ring’s proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
Should you have any questions regarding the foregoing information, please don’t hesitate to
contact me.
Respectfully submitted,

3.0 Interpretation, Construction and Severability
3.1 Definitions:
3.1.1 For purposes of this Agreement, certain terms have been defined in this Agreement to encompass meanings
that may differ from, or be in addition to, the normal connotation of the defined word. Unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise, any term defined or used in the singular will include the plural. Whenever the context may
require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words
“include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation” and/or
“but not limited to”. The words “will” and “shall” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and the
use of either connotes a mandatory requirement. The use of one or the other will not mean a different degree
of right or obligation for either Party. A defined word intended to convey its special meaning is capitalized when
used. Other terms that are capitalized and not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning in the Act, or in
the absence of their inclusion in the Act, their customary usage in the Telecommunications industry as of the
Effective Date.
3.2 Headings Not Controlling:
3.2.1 The headings and numbering of Sections, Parts, Attachments, Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.
3.2.2 This Agreement incorporates a number of Attachments which, together with their associated Exhibits,
Schedules and Addenda, constitute the entire Agreement between the Parties. In order to facilitate use and
comprehension of the Agreement, the Attachments have been grouped under broad headings. It is understood
that these groupings are for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to limit the applicability that
any particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda may otherwise have.
3.3 Referenced Documents:
3.3.1 Any reference throughout this Agreement to an industry guideline, AT&T-22STATE’s technical guideline or
referenced AT&T-22STATE business rule, guide or other such document containing processes or
specifications applicable to the services provided pursuant to this Agreement, shall be construed to refer to only
those provisions thereof that are applicable to these services, and shall include any successor or replacement
versions thereof, all as they are amended from time to time and all of which are incorporated herein by
reference, and may be found at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.4 References:
3.4.1 References herein to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments, Exhibits, Parts and Schedules shall be deemed to be
references to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments and Parts of, and Exhibits, Schedules to this Agreement,
unless the context shall otherwise require.
3.5 Tariff References:
3.5.1 References to state tariffs throughout this Agreement shall be to the currently effective tariff for the state or
jurisdiction in which the services were provisioned; provided however, where certain AT&T-22STATE services
or tariff provisions have been or become deregulated or detariffed, any reference in this Agreement to a
detariffed or deregulated service or provision of such tariff shall be deemed to refer to the service description,
price list or other agreement pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE provides such services as a result of detariffing
or deregulation.

3.5.2 Wherever the term “customer” is used in connection with AT&T-22STATE’s retail tariffs, the term “customer”
means the ultimate consumer or the End User of any tariffed service.
3.5.3 AT&T-21STATE only:
3.5.3.1 No reference to tariffs in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed as permitting CLEC to purchase
Interconnection Services, under such tariff. Except where expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement,
notwithstanding the availability of Interconnection Services under tariffs in some AT&T-21STATE incumbent
ILEC states, CLEC agrees that any purchase of Interconnection Services addressed by this Agreement or
required to be offered by AT&T-21STATE under Section 251 of the Act, shall be purchased solely pursuant
to the terms, condition and rates set forth in this Agreement. To the extent that complete terms, conditions
and/or rates for any Interconnection Service are not contained in this Agreement at the time CLEC seeks to
order such services, the Parties shall amend this Agreement to include such terms, conditions and rates prior
to CLEC submitting such order. The rates for Interconnection Services inadvertently or improperly ordered
prior to an agreement of the Parties on terms, conditions and/or rates is addressed in the Pricing Schedule.
3.5.4 AT&T CONNECTICUT only:
3.5.4.1 Whenever provisions of this Agreement could be interpreted to conflict with provisions of the Connecticut
Access Service Tariff, the Tariff shall apply.
3.6 Conflict in Provisions:
3.6.1 If any definitions, terms or conditions in any given Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda differ from those
contained in the main body of this Agreement, those definitions, terms or conditions will supersede those
contained in the main body of this Agreement, but only in regard to the services or activities listed in that
particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda. In particular, if an Attachment contains a Term length
that differs from the Term length in the main body of this Agreement, the Term length of that Attachment will
control the length of time that services or activities are to occur under that Attachment, but will not affect the
Term length of the remainder of this Agreement.
3.6.2 In AT&T CONNECTICUT only, in the event of a conflict between any provision in this Agreement and any
provision in the DPUC-ordered tariffs covering the services that are the subject of this Agreement with AT&T
CONNECTICUT, such DPUC-ordered tariffs will prevail.
3.7 Joint Work Product:
3.7.1 This Agreement is the joint work product of the Parties and has been negotiated by the Parties and their
respective counsel and shall be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms and, in the event of any
ambiguities, no inferences shall be drawn against either Party.
3.7.2 If any provision of this Agreement is rejected or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, each Party agrees
that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the Parties,
and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to affect the intent of the Parties, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with enforceable language that reflects
such intent as closely as possible. The Parties negotiated the terms and conditions of this Agreement for
Interconnection Services as a total arrangement and it is intended to be non-severable.
3.8 Incorporation by Reference:
3.8.1 All of the rates, terms and conditions (“Provisions”) set forth in this Agreement (including any and all
Attachments, and/or Schedules hereto) and every Interconnection Service provided hereunder, are subject to
all other Provisions contained in this Agreement and all such Provisions are integrally related.
3.9 Non-Voluntary Provisions:
3.9.1 This Agreement incorporates certain rates, terms and conditions that were not voluntarily negotiated and/or
agreed to by AT&T-22STATE, but instead resulted from determinations made in arbitrations under Section 252
of the Act or from other requirements of regulatory agencies or state law (individually and collectively “Non-
Voluntary Arrangement(s)”). If any Non-Voluntary Arrangement is modified as a result of any order or finding

by the FCC, the appropriate Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree to follow the
Intervening Law process outlined in Section 23.0 below.
3.9.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Non-Voluntary Arrangements contained in this Agreement shall not be
available in any state other than the state that originally imposed/required such Non-Voluntary Arrangement.
By way of example only, the Parties acknowledge that the PUC-OH’s imposition in Ohio of the Minimum
Telephone Service Standards (and all terms and conditions relating thereto) shall not apply in or be “portable
to” any State other than Ohio.
3.10 State-Specific Rates, Terms and Conditions:
3.10.1 For ease of administration, this multi-state Agreement contains certain specified rates, terms and conditions
which apply only in a designated state (“state-specific terms”).
3.10.2 State-specific terms, as the phrase is described in Section 3.10.1 above, have been negotiated (or in the case
of Section 3.9.2 above, included in the agreement per state requirement) by the Parties only as to the states
where this Agreement has been executed, filed and approved. When the Parties negotiate an agreement for
an additional state, neither Party shall be precluded by any language in this Agreement from negotiating state-
specific terms for the state in which they are to apply.
3.11 Scope of Obligations:
3.11.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, AT&T-22STATE’s obligations under this Agreement
shall apply only to:
3.11.1.1 the specific operating area(s) or portion thereof in which AT&T-22STATE is then deemed to be the ILEC
under the Act (the “ILEC Territory”), and only to the extent that the CLEC is operating and offering service to
End Users identified to be residing in such ILEC Territory; and
3.11.1.2 assets that AT&T-22STATE owns or leases and which are used in connection with AT&T-22STATE’s
provision to CLEC of any Interconnection Services provided or contemplated under this Agreement, the Act
or any tariff or ancillary agreement referenced herein (individually and collectively, the “ILEC Assets”).

obligated to make available 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6), Interconnection under
Section 251(c)(2) and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) to CLEC in AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local
Exchange Areas. AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to provide such 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation,
Interconnection and/or Resale, to CLEC for the purposes of CLEC providing and/or extending service outside of
AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange Areas. In addition, AT&T-22STATE is not obligated to provision
251(c)(3) UNEs or to provide access to (251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6), Interconnection
under Section 251(c)(2) and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) and is not otherwise bound by any 251(c)
obligations in geographic areas other than AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange Areas. Therefore, the
Parties understand and agree that the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall only apply to
the Parties and be available to CLEC for provisioning Telecommunication Services within an AT&T-22STATE
incumbent local Exchange Area(s) in the State in which this Agreement has been approved by the relevant
state Commission and is in effect.
3.11.3 Throughout this Agreement, wherever there are references to Unbundled Network Elements that are to be
provided by AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement, the Parties agree and acknowledge that their intent is for
the Agreement to comply with Section 3.11.2 above, and require only the provision of Section 251(c)(3) UNEs.
3.12 Affiliates:
3.12.1 This Agreement, including subsequent amendments, if any, shall bind AT&T-22STATE, CLEC and any entity
that currently or subsequently is owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with CLEC.
CLEC further agrees that the same or substantially the same terms and conditions shall be incorporated into
any separate agreement between AT&T-22STATE and any such CLEC Affiliate that continues to operate as a
separate entity. This Agreement shall remain effective as to CLEC and any such CLEC Affiliate for the term of
this Agreement as stated herein, (subject to any early termination due to default), until either AT&T-22STATE

specified in the Pricing Schedule to this Agreement, based upon type of service provided, and on the condition
that CLEC provides to AT&T-22STATE any and all information AT&T-22STATE reasonably requests to
effectuate such changes.
7.7 Referral Announcement
7.7.1 When an End User changes its service provider from AT&T-22STATE to CLEC or from CLEC to AT&T-

term of this Agreement and the other Party fails to cure such nonperformance or breach within forty-five (45)
calendar days after written Notice thereof. If the nonperforming Party fails to cure such nonperformance or

8.3.2 If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE is unable to contact CLEC pursuant to the
Notices provision hereof or any other contact information provided by CLEC under this Agreement, and there
are no active services being provisioned under this Agreement, then AT&T-22STATE may, at its discretion,
terminate this Agreement, without any liability whatsoever, upon sending of notification to CLEC pursuant to the
Notices section hereof.
8.4 Termination of Agreement after initial term expiration:
8.4.1 Where CLEC has no End Users or is no longer purchasing any services under this Agreement, CLEC may
terminate the Agreement by providing “Notice of Termination” to AT&T-22STATE at any time after the initial
term of this Agreement. After termination the Parties’ liability for termination of this Agreement shall be limited
to obligations under the Survival 40.1 below of this GTC.
8.4.2 Where CLEC has End Users and/or is purchasing Interconnection Services under this Agreement and either
Party seeks to terminate this Agreement, CLEC shall cooperate in good faith to effect an orderly transition of
service under this Agreement. CLEC shall be solely responsible (from a financial, operational and
administrative standpoint) to ensure that its End Users are transitioned to a new LEC prior to the expiration or
termination date of this Agreement.
8.4.3 If at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days or any time thereafter of the expiration of the Term, if
either Party serves “Notice of Expiration,” CLEC shall have ten (10) calendar days to provide AT&T-22STATE
written confirmation to the Notice of Expiration indicating if CLEC wishes to pursue a successor agreement with
AT&T-22STATE or terminate its Agreement. CLEC shall identify the action to be taken in each of the
applicable state(s). If CLEC wishes to pursue a successor agreement with AT&T-22STATE, CLEC shall attach
to its written confirmation or Notice of Expiration, a written request to commence negotiations with AT&T-
22STATE under Sections 251/252 of the Act and identify each of the state(s) to which the successor
agreement will apply. Upon receipt of CLEC’s Section 252(a)(1) request, the Parties shall commence good
faith negotiations for a successor agreement.
8.4.4 If the Parties are in “Active Negotiations” (negotiations within the statutory clock established in the Act under
Section 252(b)) or have filed for arbitration with the Commission upon expiration date of the Agreement AT&T-
22STATE shall continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement until a successor agreement becomes effective between the Parties. AT&T-22STATE’s obligation
to provide services under this Agreement beyond the expiration date conditions upon the Parties adherence to
the timeframes established within Section 252(b) of the Act. If CLEC does not adhere to said timeframes or
CLEC withdraws its arbitration or seeks an extension of time or continuance of such arbitration with AT&T-
22STATE’s consent, AT&T-22STATE may provide Notice to CLEC that all services provided thereafter shall be
pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s then current standard interconnection
agreement (“Generic”) as found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
8.4.5 Either on or following the expiration date of this Agreement, if the Parties have not entered into a new
agreement or are not in Active Negotiations as described in Section 8.4.4 above, then upon written Notice to
CLEC by AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE may continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s then current Generic found at the AT&T CLEC Online
website. At any time thereafter, the Parties may initiate negotiations for a new agreement by providing a written
Notice under Section 252 to the other Party.
9.0 End User Fraud
9.1 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC for any fraud associated with CLEC’s End User account, including 1+ IntraLATA toll,
ported numbers, and ABT.
9.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in cases of fraud involving
1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties' fraud minimization procedures are to be cost-effective and
implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm one Party as compared to the other.
9.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in Section 9.1 above will
include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning End Users who terminate services to that Party
without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such information is responsible for securing the End User's
permission to obtain such information.

9.4 AT&T-22STATE will use a Fraud Monitoring System to determine suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud and will provide
notification messages to CLEC on suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud on CLEC accounts stored in the applicable LIDB.
9.5 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of fraud. CLEC understands and
agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to determine whether a fraud situation actually exists. CLEC
understands and agrees that it will also need to determine what, if any, action CLEC should take as a result of a Fraud
Monitoring System alert.
9.6 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud Monitoring System alert
notification.
10.0 Assurance of Payment
10.1 Upon request by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC will provide AT&T-22STATE with the AT&T-22STATE Credit Profile form and provide
information to AT&T-22STATE regarding CLEC’s credit and financial condition.
10.2 Assurance of payment may be requested by AT&T-22STATE:
10.2.1 If based on AT&T-22STATE’s analysis of the AT&T-22STATE Credit Profile and other relevant information
regarding CLEC’s credit and financial condition, there is an impairment of the credit, financial health, or credit
worthiness of CLEC. Such impairment will be determined from information available from Third Party financial
sources; or
10.2.2 CLEC fails to timely pay a bill rendered to CLEC by AT&T-22STATE (except such portion of a bill that is
subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth in
Section 12.4 below); and/or
10.2.3 CLEC’s gross monthly billing has increased, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to request additional security
(or to require a security deposit if none was previously requested) and/or file a Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC-1) security interest in CLEC’s “accounts receivables and proceeds”; or
10.2.4 When CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary case
(or has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other law
relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has made an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding.
10.3 If AT&T-22STATE requires CLEC to provide a security deposit, CLEC shall provide such security deposit prior to the
inauguration of service or within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-22STATE’s request, as applicable. Deposit request notices
will be sent to CLEC via certified mail or overnight delivery. Such notice period will start the day after the deposit request notice
is rendered by certified mail or overnight delivery. Interest on a cash security deposit shall accrue and be applied or refunded in
accordance with the terms in AT&T-22STATE’s applicable Tariff.
10.4 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the assurance of payment will consist of:
10.4.1 a Cash Deposit or
10.4.2 a Letter of Credit or
10.4.3 a Surety Bond
10.5 The Cash Deposit, Letter of Credit or Surety Bond must be in an amount up to three (3) months anticipated charges (including,
but not limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination charges and advance payments), as
reasonably determined by AT&T-22STATE, for the Interconnection Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation or any other functions,
facilities, products or services to be furnished by AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement. Estimated billings are calculated based
upon the monthly average of the previous six (6) months current billings, if CLEC has received service from AT&T-22STATE
during such period at a level comparable to that anticipated to occur over the next six (6) months. If either CLEC or AT&T-
22STATE has reason to believe that the level of service to be received during the next six (6) months will be materially higher or
lower than received in the previous six (6) months, CLEC and AT&T-22STATE shall agree on a level of estimated billings based
on all relevant information.
10.6 To the extent that AT&T-22STATE elects to require a Cash Deposit, the Parties intend that the provision of such Cash Deposit
shall constitute the grant of a security interest in the Cash Deposit pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect
in any relevant jurisdiction.

10.7 Interest on a Cash Deposit shall accrue and be applied or refunded in accordance with the terms in the appropriate AT&T-
22STATE Tariff. AT&T-22STATE will not pay interest on a Letter of Credit or a Surety Bond.
10.8 AT&T-22STATE may, but is not obligated to, draw on the Letter of Credit or the Cash Deposit, as applicable, upon the
occurrence of any one of the following events:
10.8.1 CLEC owes AT&T-22STATE undisputed charges under this Agreement that are more than thirty (30) calendar
days past due; or
10.8.2 CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary case (or has
had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S Bankruptcy Code or any other law relating to
insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has made an assignment
for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding; or
10.8.3 The expiration or termination of this Agreement.
10.9 If AT&T-22STATE draws on the Letter of Credit or Cash Deposit, upon request by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC will provide a
replacement or supplemental Letter of Credit, Surety Bond or Cash Deposit conforming to the requirements of Section 10.4
above.
10.10 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if AT&T-22STATE makes a request for assurance of payment in
accordance with the terms of this Section 10.10 then AT&T-22STATE shall have no obligation thereafter to perform under this
Agreement until such time as CLEC has furnished AT&T-22STATE with the assurance of payment requested; provided,
however, that AT&T-22STATE will permit CLEC a minimum of fifteen (15) calendar days to respond to a request for assurance
of payment before invoking this Section 10.10.
10.11 In the event CLEC fails to provide AT&T-22STATE with a suitable form of security deposit or additional security deposit as
required herein, defaults on its account(s), or otherwise fails to make any payment or payments required under this Agreement in
the manner and within the time required, service to CLEC may be suspended, discontinued or terminated in accordance with the
terms of Section 10.0 above. Upon termination of services, AT&T-22STATE shall apply any security deposit to CLEC’s final bill
for its account(s). If CLEC fails to furnish the requested adequate assurance of payment on or before the date set forth in the
request, AT&T-22STATE may also invoke the provisions set forth in Section 12.0 below.
10.12 A Cash Deposit held by AT&T-22STATE shall be returned to CLEC if the following conditions have been met:
10.12.1 Payment was made on bills rendered to CLEC by AT&T-22STATE (except such portion of a bill that is subject
to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth in Section
12.4 below) as of the Bill Due Date for all but one time during the prior twelve month period and all payments
were made with checks that were honored and,
10.12.2 There has been no impairment of the established credit and/or financial health from information available from
financial sources, including but not limited to Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and the Wall Street Journal.
Financial information about CLEC that may be considered includes, but is not limited to, investor warning briefs,
rating downgrades, and articles discussing pending credit problems.
10.13 The fact that a Cash Deposit or Letter of Credit is requested by AT&T-22STATE shall in no way relieve CLEC from timely
compliance with all payment obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage
sensitive charges, termination charges and advance payments), nor does it constitute a waiver or modification of the terms of
this Agreement pertaining to disconnection or re-entry for non-payment of any amounts required to be paid hereunder.
10.14 At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit provided by CLEC as security under this
Agreement, CLEC shall renew such Letter of Credit or provide AT&T-22STATE with evidence that CLEC has obtained a suitable
replacement for the Letter of Credit. If CLEC fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE shall thereafter be authorized to
draw down the full amount of such Letter of Credit and utilize the cash proceeds as security for CLEC accounts(s). If CLEC
provides a security deposit or additional security deposit in the form of a Surety Bond as required herein, CLEC shall renew the
Surety Bond or provide AT&T-22STATE with evidence that CLEC has obtained a suitable replacement for the Surety Bond at
least seven (7) calendar days prior to the cancellation date of the Surety Bond. If CLEC fails to comply with the foregoing,
AT&T-22STATE shall thereafter be authorized to take action on the Surety Bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for
CLEC’s account(s). If the credit rating of any bonding company that has provided CLEC with a Surety Bond provided as security
hereunder has fallen below “B”, AT&T-22STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC that CLEC must provide a replacement
bond or other suitable security within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-22STATE’s written Notice. If CLEC fails to comply with

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE shall thereafter be authorized to take action on the Surety Bond and utilize the cash proceeds as
security for CLEC’s account(s). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, AT&T-22STATE shall be
authorized to draw down the full amount of any Letter of Credit or take action on any Surety Bond provided by CLEC as security
hereunder if CLEC defaults on its account(s) or otherwise fails to make any payment or payments required under this Agreement
in the manner and within the time, as required herein.
11.0 Billing and Payment of Charges
11.1 Unless otherwise stated, each Party will render monthly bill(s), remittance in full by the Bill Due Date, to the other for
Interconnection Services provided hereunder at the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
11.2 A Late Payment Charge will be assessed for all Past Due payments as provided below, as applicable.
11.2.1 If any portion of the payment is not received by AT&T-22STATE on or before the payment due date as set forth
above, or if any portion of the payment is received by AT&T-22STATE in funds that are not immediately
available to AT&T-22STATE, then a late payment and/or interest charge shall be due to AT&T-22STATE. The
late payment and/or interest charge shall apply to the portion of the payment not received and shall be
assessed as set forth in the applicable state tariff, or, if no applicable state tariff exists, as set forth in the Guide
Book as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website, or pursuant to the applicable state law as determined by
AT&T-22STATE. In addition to any applicable late payment and/or interest charges, CLEC may be charged a
fee for all returned checks at the rate set forth in the applicable state tariff, or, if no applicable tariff exists, as set
forth in the Guide Book or pursuant to the applicable state law.
11.3 If any charge incurred by AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement is Past Due, the unpaid amounts will accrue interest from the
day following the Bill Due Date until paid. The interest rate applied will be the lesser of (i) the rate used to compute the Late
Payment Charge contained in the applicable AT&T-22STATE intrastate access services tariff for that state and (ii) the highest
rate of interest that may be charged under Applicable Law, compounded daily from the Bill Due Date to and including the date
that the payment is actually made and available.
11.4 The Remittance Information to apply payments must accompany the payment. Payment is considered to have been made when
the payment and Remittance Information are received by AT&T-22STATE. If the Remittance Information is not received with
payment, AT&T-22STATE will be unable to apply amounts paid to CLEC’s accounts. In such event, AT&T-22STATE shall hold
such funds until the Remittance Information is received. If AT&T-22STATE does not receive the Remittance Information by the
Bill due date for any account(s), Late Payment Charges shall apply.
11.5 CLEC shall make all payments to AT&T-22STATE via electronic funds transfers (EFTs) through the Automated Clearing House
Association (ACH) to the financial institution designated by AT&T-22STATE. Remittance Information will be communicated
together with the funds transfer via the ACH network. CLEC must use the CCD+ or the CTX Standard Entry Class code. CLEC
and AT&T-22STATE will abide by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) Rules and Regulations. Each
ACH payment must be received by AT&T-22STATE no later than the Bill Due Date of each bill or Late Payment Charges will
apply. AT&T-22STATE is not liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in entries caused by CLEC or Third Parties,
including CLEC’s financial institution. CLEC is responsible for its own banking fees.
11.6 Prior to establishing EFT, CLEC will complete a Customer Information Form for Electronic Payments (ECF11 Form) found on
AT&T’s CLEC Online website. This form provides AT&T-22STATE with CLEC’s set up and contract information for electronic
payments. AT&T-22STATE banking information will be provided by AT&T-22STATE Treasury & Remittance Operations on
AT&T-22STATE approved forms after the CLEC’s completed ECF11 form is received, testing has completed and certification
confirmed.
11.7 Processing of payments not made via electronic funds credit transfers through the ACH network may be delayed. CLEC is
responsible for any Late Payment Charges resulting from CLEC’s failure to use electronic funds credit transfers through the ACH
network.
11.8 If any portion of an amount due to the Billing Party under this Agreement is subject to a bona fide dispute between the Parties,
the Non-Paying Party must, prior to the Bill Due Date, give written notice to the Billing Party of the Disputed Amounts and include
in such written notice the specific details and reasons for disputing each item listed in Section 13.4 below. The Disputing Party
should utilize any existing and preferred form or method provided by the Billing Party to communicate disputes to the Billing
Party. On or before the Bill Due Date, the Non-Paying Party must pay (i) all undisputed amounts to the Billing Party, and (ii) all
Disputed Amounts, other than disputed charges arising from Intercarrier Compensation into an interest bearing escrow account
with a Third Party escrow agent mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

as the principal; and
11.9.2.5 disbursements from the escrow account will be limited to those:
authorized in writing by both the Disputing Party and the Billing Party (that is, signature(s) from representative(s) of the Disputing Party
only are not sufficient to properly authorize any disbursement); or
made in accordance with the final, non-appealable order of the arbitrator appointed pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.7 below; or
made in accordance with the final, non-appealable order of the court that had jurisdiction to enter the arbitrator’s award pursuant to Section

disbursement and the amount of Late Payment Charges the Billing Party is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 11.8 above.
11.13 If the Non-Paying Party disputes any charges and the entire dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party, the Parties will
cooperate to ensure that all of the actions required by Section 11.12.1 above and Section 11.12.3 above are completed within
the times specified therein.
11.14 Failure by the Non-Paying Party to pay any charges determined to be owed to the Billing Party within the time specified in

11.15 CLEC will notify AT&T-22STATE at least ninety (90) calendar days or three (3) monthly billing cycles prior to any billing changes.
At that time a sample of the new invoice will be provided so that AT&T-22STATE has time to program for any changes that may

and not subject to any Late Payment Charges, until the appropriate amount of time has passed to allow AT&T-22STATE the
opportunity to test the new format and make changes deemed necessary.
11.16 If either Party requests one or more additional copies of a bill, the requesting Party will pay the Billing Party a reasonable fee for
each additional copy as specified in the Pricing Schedule, unless such copy was requested due to failure in delivery of the
original bill or correction(s) to the original bill.
12.0 Nonpayment and Procedures for Disconnection
12.1 If a Party is furnished Interconnection Services under the terms of this Agreement in more than one (1) state, Section 12.2 below
through Section 12.19 below, inclusive, shall be applied separately for each such state.
12.2 Failure to pay charges shall be grounds for disconnection of Interconnection Services furnished under this Agreement. If a Party
fails to pay any charges billed to it under this Agreement, including but not limited to any Late Payment Charges or Unpaid
Charges, and any portion of such Unpaid Charges remain unpaid after the Bill Due Date, the Billing Party will send a
Discontinuance Notice to such Non-Paying Party. The Non-Paying Party must remit all Unpaid Charges to the Billing Party

escrow account that complies with all of the terms set forth in Section 11.9 above and deposited a sum equal to
the Disputed Amounts into that account (other than Disputed Amounts arising from Intercarrier Compensation).
Until evidence that the full amount of the Disputed Charges (other than Disputed Amounts arising from
Intercarrier Compensation) has been deposited into an escrow account that complies with Section 11.9 above
is furnished to the Billing Party, such Unpaid Charges will not be deemed to be “disputed” under Section 13.0
below.
12.5 Issues related to Disputed Amounts shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures identified in the Dispute Resolution
provision set forth in Section 13.0 below.

be unbilled, under-billed or over-billed, but only when such charges appeared or should have appeared on a
bill dated within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date on which the Billing Party provided
written notice to the Billed Party of the amount of the back-billing or the Billed Party provided written notice to
the Billing Party of the claimed credit amount. The Parties agree that the twelve (12) month limitation on

the period specified by the commission in the final order allowing or approving such charge or (b) twelve (12)
months from the date of the final order allowing or approving such charge or (c) twelve months from the date
of approval of any executed amendment to this Agreement required to implement such charge.

13.1 Finality of Disputes:
13.1.1 Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, no claim may be brought for any dispute arising
from this Agreement more than twenty-four (24) months from the date the occurrence which gives rise to the
dispute is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered with the exercise of due care and attention.
13.1.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party shall be entitled to dispute only
those charges which appeared on a bill dated within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date on
which the Billing Party received notice of such Disputed Amounts.
13.2 Alternative to Litigation:

agree to use the following Dispute Resolution procedures with respect to any controversy or claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or its breach.
13.3 Commencing Dispute Resolution:
13.3.1 Dispute Resolution shall commence upon one Party’s receipt of written Notice of a controversy or claim arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach. No Party may pursue any claim unless such written Notice
has first been given to the other Party. There are three (3) separate Dispute Resolution methods:
13.3.1.1 Service Center Dispute Resolution
13.3.1.2 Informal Dispute Resolution; and
13.3.1.3 Formal Dispute Resolution, each of which is described below.

13.4.1 If the written Notice given pursuant to Section 13.3 above discloses that the dispute relates to billing, then the
procedures set forth in Section 12.4 above shall be used.
13.4.2 For a dispute submitted by the CLEC, the dispute shall first be processed by the appropriate service center for
resolution.
13.4.3 In order to resolve a billing dispute, the Disputing Party shall furnish the other Party written Notice of
13.4.3.1 the date of the bill in question,
13.4.3.2 the account number or other identification (CLEC must provide the CBA/ESBA/ASBS or BAN number) of the
bill in question,

forth in Section 11.9 above of this Agreement and deposited all Unpaid Charges relating to Resale Services
and 251(c)(3) UNEs into that escrow account in order for that billing claim to be deemed a “dispute”. Failure to
provide the information and evidence required by this Section 13.0 not later than twenty-nine (29) calendar
days following the Bill Due Date shall constitute CLEC’s irrevocable and full waiver of its right to dispute the
subject charges
13.4.5 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on current billing statements thirty (30) to
sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided the Disputing Party furnishes all requisite information

statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days, but resolution may take longer depending on the
complexity of the dispute. If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days from the date Notice of the Disputed
Amounts was received (provided that CLEC furnishes all requisite information and evidence under Section 13.4
above, upon request, the non-Disputing Party will notify the Disputing Party of the status of the dispute and the
expected resolution date.
13.4.7 If the Disputing Party is not satisfied by the resolution of the billing dispute under this Section 13.4 above, the
Disputing Party may notify the Billing Party in writing that it wishes to invoke the Informal Resolution of Disputes
afforded pursuant to Section 13.5 below of this Agreement.
13.5 Informal Dispute Resolution:
13.5.1 Upon receipt by one Party of Notice of a dispute by the other Party pursuant to Section 13.3 above or Section
13.4.7 above, each Party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in
good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The location, form, frequency, duration, and
conclusion of these discussions will be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the
representatives may utilize other alternative Dispute Resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the
negotiations. Discussions and the correspondence among the representatives for purposes of settlement are
exempt from discovery and production and will not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any
lawsuit without the concurrence of both Parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications
that were not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted, and, if otherwise admissible, may
be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.

appropriate, may be invoked not earlier than sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the letter initiating Dispute
Resolution under Section 13.3 above.
13.6.2 Claims Subject to Mandatory Arbitration:
13.6.2.1 The following claims, if not settled through informal Dispute Resolution, will be subject to mandatory
arbitration pursuant to Section 13.7 below:
13.6.2.2 Each unresolved billing dispute involving one percent (1%) or less of the amounts charged to the Disputing
Party under this Agreement in the state in which the dispute arises during the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding receipt of the letter initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 13.3 above. If the
disputing Party has not been billed for a minimum of twelve (12) months immediately preceding receipt of the
letter initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 13.3 above, the Parties will annualize the actual number of
months billed.
13.6.3 Claims Subject to Elective Arbitration:
13.6.3.1 Claims will be subject to elective arbitration pursuant to Section 13.7 below, if, and only if, the claim is not
settled through informal Dispute Resolution and both Parties agree to arbitration. If both Parties do not agree

mechanism.

13.6.4.4 All claims arising under federal or state statute(s), including antitrust claims.
13.7 Arbitration:
13.7.1 Disputes subject to mandatory or elective arbitration under the provisions of this Agreement will be submitted to
a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or
pursuant to such other provider of arbitration services or rules as the Parties may agree. The arbitrator shall be
knowledgeable of telecommunications issues. Each arbitration will be held in Atlanta, Georgia for AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, Dallas, Texas for AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE); Chicago, Illinois
for AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, San Francisco, California for AT&T CALIFORNIA; Reno, Nevada for
AT&T NEVADA; or New Haven, Connecticut for AT&T CONNECTICUT, as appropriate, unless the Parties
agree otherwise. The arbitration hearing will be requested to commence within sixty (60) calendar days of the
demand for arbitration. The arbitrator will control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The
Parties may submit written briefs upon a schedule determined by the arbitrator. The Parties will request that
the arbitrator rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of
hearings. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Secs. 1-16, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all
disputes. Notwithstanding any rule of the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules to the contrary, the Parties agree
that the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive damages, exemplary damages, Consequential
Damages, multiple damages, or any other damages not measured by the prevailing Party’s actual damages,
and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. The times specified in this Section 13.0 may be extended or shortened upon mutual
agreement of the Parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Each Party will bear its own costs
of these procedures, including attorneys’ fees. The Parties will equally split the fees of the arbitration and the
arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

Agreement that affects the accuracy of Auditing Party’s billing and invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Auditing Party may audit the Audited Party’s books, records and documents more than once
annually if the previous audit found (i) previously uncorrected net variances or errors in invoices in Audited Party’s favor with an
aggregate value of at least five percent (5%) of the amounts payable by Auditing Party for audited services provided during the
period covered by the audit or (ii) non-compliance by Audited Party with any provision of this Agreement affecting Auditing
Party’s billing and invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party with an aggregate value of at least five percent (5%) of the
amounts payable by Audited Party for audited services provided during the period covered by the audit.
14.2 The Parties also must mutually agree on a written scope of the audit and the billing and invoices to be audited prior to the
initiation of the audit.
14.3 The audit shall be limited to the period which is the shorter of (i) the period subsequent to the last day of the period covered by
the audit which was last performed (or if no audit has been performed, the service start date and (ii) the twelve (12) month period
immediately preceding the date the Audited Party received notice of such requested audit, but in any event not prior to the
Service Start Date.
14.4 Such audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor acceptable to both Parties. Auditing Party shall insure that the
independent auditor executes a nondisclosure agreement in a form agreed upon by the Parties prior to engaging in any audit
work.
14.5 Each audit shall be conducted on the premises of the Audited Party during normal business hours. Audited Party shall
cooperate fully in any such audit and shall provide the auditor reasonable access to any and all appropriate Audited Party
employees and any books, records and other documents reasonably necessary to assess (i) the accuracy of Audited Party’s bills
and (ii) Audited Party’s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement that affect the accuracy of Auditing Party’s billing and
invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party hereunder. Except where to do so would defeat the purpose of the audit, the
Audited Party may redact from the books, records and other documents provided to the auditor any Audited Party information
that reveals the identity of End Users of Audited Party.
14.6 Each Party shall maintain reports, records and data relevant to the billing of any services that are the subject matter of this
Agreement for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) months after creation thereof, unless a longer period is required by
Applicable Law.
14.7 If any audit confirms any undercharge or overcharge, then Audited Party shall (i) promptly correct any billing error, including
making refund of any overpayment by Auditing Party in the form of a credit on the invoice for the first full billing cycle after the
Parties have agreed upon the accuracy of the audit results and (ii) for any undercharge caused by the actions of the Audited
Party, immediately compensate Auditing Party for such undercharge, and (iii) in each case, calculate and pay interest as
provided in Section 11.2.1 above(depending on the AT&T-owned ILEC(s) involved), for the number of calendar days from the
date on which such undercharge or overcharge originated until the date on which such credit is issued or payment is made and
available.
14.8 Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, audits shall be performed at Auditing Party’s expense, subject to
reimbursement by Audited Party of one-quarter (1/4) of any independent auditor's fees and expenses in the event that an audit
finds, and the Parties subsequently verify, a net adjustment in the charges paid or payable by Auditing Party hereunder by an
amount that is, on an annualized basis, greater than five percent (5%) of the aggregate charges for the audited services during
the period covered by the audit.
14.9 Any disputes concerning audit results shall be referred to the Parties’ respective personnel responsible for informal resolution. If
these individuals cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the referral, either Party may request in writing that
an additional audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor acceptable to both Parties, subject to the requirements set out
in Section 14.1 above. Any additional audit shall be at the requesting Party’s expense.
15.0 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties
15.1 DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER PARTY CONCERNING THE SPECIFIC QUALITY OF
ANY SERVICES, OR FACILITIES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES DISCLAIM, WITHOUT

16.1 Except for any indemnification obligations of the Parties hereunder, each Party’s liability to the other for any Loss relating to or
arising out of any cause whatsoever, including any negligent act or omission (whether willful or inadvertent) whether based in
contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, relating to the performance of this Agreement, shall not exceed a credit for the actual
cost of the facilities, products, services or functions not performed or provided or improperly performed or provided.
16.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in specific Attachments, in the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a Third Party to
have arisen out of the negligence or willful misconduct of any Party, each Party shall bear, and its obligation shall be limited to,
that portion (as mutually agreed to by the Parties or as otherwise established) of the resulting expense caused by its own
negligence or willful misconduct or that of its agents, servants, contractors, or others acting in aid or concert with it.
16.3 A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and contracts with its End Users or Third Parties that relate to any
Interconnection Services provided or contemplated under this Agreement that, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
Law, such Party shall not be liable to such End User or Third Party for (i) any Loss relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds the amount such Party would have charged the End User or Third Party for
the Interconnection Services that gave rise to such Loss and (ii) any Consequential Damages. If a Party elects not to place in its
tariffs or contracts such limitation(s) of liability, and the other Party incurs a Loss as a result thereof, the first Party shall indemnify
and reimburse the other Party for that portion of the Loss that would have been limited had the first Party included in its tariffs
and contracts the limitation(s) of liability described in this Section 16.0.
16.4 Neither CLEC nor AT&T-22STATE shall be liable to the other Party for any Consequential Damages suffered by the other Party,
regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty, strict liability, tort or otherwise, including negligence of any kind,
whether active or passive (and including alleged breaches of this Agreement and causes of action alleged to arise from
allegations that breach of this Agreement constitutes a violation of the Act or other statute), and regardless of whether the Parties
knew or had been advised of the possibility that such damages could result in connection with or arising from anything said,
omitted, or done hereunder or related hereto, including willful acts or omissions; provided that the foregoing shall not limit a
Party’s obligation under Section 16.0 to indemnify, defend, and hold the other Party harmless against any amounts payable to a
Third Party, including any Losses, and Consequential Damages of such Third Party; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 16.4 shall impose indemnity obligations on a Party for any Loss or Consequential Damages suffered by that Party’s End
User in connection with any affected Interconnection Services. Except as provided in the prior sentence, each Party
(“Indemnifying Party”) hereby releases and holds harmless the other Party (“Indemnitee”) (and Indemnitee’s Affiliates, and its
respective officers, directors, employees and agents) against any Loss or Claim made by the Indemnifying Party’s End User.
16.5 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable for damages to an End User’s premises resulting from the furnishing of any Interconnection
Services, including, if applicable, the installation and removal of equipment and associated wiring, and Collocation Equipment
unless the damage is caused by AT&T-22STATE’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. AT&T-22STATE does not guarantee
or make any warranty with respect to Interconnection Services when used in an explosive atmosphere.
16.6 CLEC hereby releases AT&T-22STATE from any and all liability for damages due to errors or omissions in CLEC’s End User
listing information as provided by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement, including any errors or omissions occurring in
the Directory Database or the White Pages directory, or any claims by reason of delay in providing the Directory Assistance
listing information, printing or provisioning of non-published numbers or the printing or providing of CLEC End User information in
the White Pages directory including, but not limited to, special, indirect, Consequential, punitive or incidental damages.
16.7 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC, its End User or any other Person for any Loss alleged to arise out of the provision
of access to 911 service or any errors, interruptions, defects, failures or malfunctions of 911 service.
16.8 This Section 16.0 is not intended to exempt any Party from all liability under this Agreement, but only to set forth the scope of
liability agreed to and the type of damages that are recoverable. Both Parties acknowledge that they negotiated regarding
alternate limitation of liability provisions but that such provisions would have altered the cost, and thus the price, of providing the
Interconnection, Resale Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs, functions, facilities, products and services available hereunder, and no
different pricing reflecting different costs and different limits of liability was agreed to.
17.0 Indemnity
17.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific Attachments, each Party shall be responsible only for the
Interconnection Services which are provided by that Party, its authorized agents, subcontractors, or others retained by such
Parties, and neither Party shall bear any responsibility for the Interconnection Services, provided by the other Party, its agents,
subcontractors, or others retained by such Parties.

not otherwise controlled by tariff, each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall release, defend and indemnify the other Party (the
“Indemnified Party”) and hold such Indemnified Party harmless against any Loss to a Third Party arising out of the negligence or
willful misconduct (“Fault”) of such Indemnifying Party, its agents, its End Users, contractors, or others retained by such Parties,
in connection with the Indemnifying Party’s provision of Interconnection Services under this Agreement; provided, however, that
(i) with respect to employees or agents of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their
employment, (ii) with respect to subcontractors of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing duties of
the subcontractor under its subcontract with the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) with respect to the Fault of employees or agents of
such subcontractor, such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their employment by the subcontractor with respect to
such duties of the subcontractor under the subcontract.
17.3 In the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a End User of either Party, the Party whose End User alleged or claimed such
Loss (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend and indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”) against any and all such
Claims or Losses by its End User regardless of whether the underlying Interconnection Service giving rise to such Claim or Loss
was provided or provisioned by the Indemnified Party, unless the Claim or Loss was caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Indemnified Party.
17.4 A Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (“Indemnified Party”) against any

17.4.1.2 The foregoing includes any Losses arising from Claims for actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual
Property right of a Third Party to the extent that such Loss arises from an Indemnifying Party’s or an

however, that an Indemnifying Party’s obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party shall not
apply:

combine AT&T-22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) may be subject to or limited by
Intellectual Property rights (including without limitation, patent, copyright, trade secret, trade mark, service mark, trade name and
trade dress rights) and contract rights of Third Parties.
17.6 AT&T-22STATE agrees to use its best efforts to obtain for CLEC, under commercially reasonable terms, Intellectual Property
rights to each 251(c)(3) UNE necessary for CLEC to use such 251(c)(3) UNE in the same manner as AT&T-22STATE.
17.7 AT&T-22STATE shall have no obligation to attempt to obtain for CLEC any Intellectual Property right(s) that would permit CLEC

UNE including AT&T-22STATE.
17.10 AT&T-22STATE hereby conveys no licenses to use such Intellectual Property rights and makes no warranties, express or
implied, concerning CLEC’s (or any Third Parties’) rights with respect to such Intellectual Property rights and contract rights,
including whether such rights will be violated by such Interconnection or unbundling and/or combining of 251(c)(3) UNEs
(including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) in AT&T-22STATE’s network or CLEC's use of other functions, facilities,
products or services furnished under this Agreement. Any licenses or warranties for Intellectual Property rights associated with
251(c)(3) UNEs are vendor licenses and warranties and are a part of the Intellectual Property rights AT&T-22STATE agrees in
Section 17.7 above to use its best efforts to obtain.
17.11 AT&T-22STATE does not and shall not indemnify, defend or hold CLEC harmless, nor be responsible for indemnifying or
defending, or holding CLEC harmless, for any Claims or Losses for actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property
right or interference with or violation of any contract right that arises out of, is caused by, or relates to CLEC’s Interconnection
with AT&T-22STATE’s network and unbundling and/or combining AT&T-22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with

CLEC’s improper use of AT&T-22STATE’s facilities, or due to malfunction of any facilities, functions, products, services or
equipment provided by any person or entity other than AT&T-22STATE. Upon reimbursement for damages, AT&T-22STATE
will cooperate with CLEC in prosecuting a claim against the person causing such damage. CLEC shall be subrogated to the
right of recovery by AT&T-22STATE for the damages to the extent of such payment.
17.13 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each Party agrees that should it cause any non-standard digital
subscriber line (“xDSL”) technologies (as that term is defined in the applicable Attachment 14 - xDSL Loops and/or the applicable
Commission-ordered tariff, as appropriate) to be deployed or used in connection with or on AT&T-22STATE facilities, that Party
(“Indemnifying Party”) will pay all costs associated with any damage, service interruption or other Telecommunications Service
degradation, or damage to the other Party’s (“Indemnitee’s”) facilities.
17.14 Indemnification Procedures:
17.14.1 Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this Section 17.0, the relevant Indemnified Party, as
appropriate, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and request in writing the Indemnifying Party to defend
the same. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that
the Indemnifying Party might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s
ability to defend such claim.
17.14.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of the defense of such claim
and the identity of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party.
17.14.3 Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides written notice of acceptance of the defense of such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall defend such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to any right of the
Indemnifying Party to seek reimbursement for the costs of such defense in the event that it is determined that
Indemnifying Party had no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such claim.
17.14.4 Upon accepting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control and conduct the
defense and settlement of any such claims, subject to consultation with the Indemnified Party. So long as the
Indemnifying Party is controlling and conducting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in advance
and agrees to be bound by the agreement incorporating such settlement.
17.14.5 At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise or settlement, and, at such
refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that, in such event the Indemnifying Party shall not
be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the refusing Party against, any cost or liability in excess
of such refused compromise or settlement.

17.14.6 With respect to any defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to
participate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the claim requests equitable relief or other relief that
could affect the rights of the Indemnified Party, and shall also be entitled to employ separate counsel for such
defense at such Indemnified Party's expense.
17.14.7 If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any indemnified claim as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel for such defense at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party.
17.14.8 In the event of a failure to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may negotiate a settlement, which shall
be presented to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented settlement,
the Indemnifying Party may take over the defense. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented
settlement and refuses to take over the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any reasonable cash
settlement not involving any admission of liability by the Indemnifying Party, though such settlement may have
been made by the Indemnified Party without approval of the Indemnifying Party, it being the Parties’ intent that
no settlement involving a non-monetary concession by the Indemnifying Party, including an admission of liability
by such Party, shall take effect without the written approval of the Indemnifying Party.
17.14.9 Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause its employees and agents to cooperate with the other Party in the
defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each Party shall be available to the other Party with
respect to any such defense, subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Section 22.0 below.
18.0 Performance Measures
18.1 Attachment 09 - Performance Measures specifies applicable performance standards. To the extent that remedies are available
under such Attachment, such remedies constitute the sole obligation of AT&T-22STATE to pay damages or financial penalties
for failure to meet specified performance standards identified in such Attachment and all other Attachments to this Agreement.
19.0 Intellectual Property/ License
19.1 Any Intellectual Property originating from or developed by a Party shall remain in the exclusive ownership of that Party.
19.2 Except at otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no license under patents, copyrights or any other Intellectual Property
right (other than the limited license to use consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement) is granted by
either Party or shall be implied or arise by estoppel with respect to any transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

26.2 Only an End User can initiate a challenge to a change in its LEC. If an End User notifies one Party that the End User requests
local Exchange Service, and the other Party is such End User’s LEC, then the Party receiving such request shall be free to
immediately access such End User’s CPNI subject to the requirements of Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS)

CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has been completed.
26.5 Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to investigate any allegations of unauthorized changes in local Exchange

28.1.1 Intercept Devices:

telephone service providers. When either Party receives a request associated with an End User of the other
Party, it shall refer such request to the Party that serves such End User, unless the request directs the
receiving Party to attach a pen register, trap-and-trace or form of intercept on the Party’s facilities, in which
case that Party shall comply with any valid request.
28.1.2 Subpoenas:
28.1.2.1 If a Party receives a subpoena for information concerning an End User the Party knows to be an End User of
the other Party, it shall refer the subpoena to the Requesting Party with an indication that the other Party is
the responsible company, unless the subpoena requests records for a period of time during which the
receiving Party was the End User’s service provider, in which case that Party will respond to any valid
request.

34.0 Taxes
34.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 34.0, with respect to any purchase of products or services under this Agreement, if
any Tax is required or permitted by Applicable Law to be billed to and/or collected from the purchasing Party by the providing
Party, then: (i) the providing Party shall have the right to bill the purchasing Party for such Tax; (ii) the purchasing Party shall pay
such Tax to the providing Party; and (iii) the providing Party shall pay or remit such Tax to the respective Governmental
Authority. Whenever possible, Taxes shall be billed as a separate item on the invoice; provided, however, that failure to include
Taxes on an invoice or to state a Tax separately shall not impair the obligation of the purchasing Party to pay any Tax. Nothing

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
shall prevent the providing Party from paying any Tax to the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to the time: (i) it bills the
purchasing Party for such Tax, or (ii) it collects the Tax from the purchasing Party. If the providing Party fails to bill the
purchasing Party for a Tax at the time of billing the products or services to which the Tax relates, then, as between the providing
Party and the purchasing Party, the providing Party shall be liable for any penalties or interest thereon. However, if the
purchasing Party fails to pay any Tax properly billed by the providing Party, then, as between the providing Party and the
purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall be solely responsible for payment of the Tax and any penalties or interest thereon.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 34.0 governing contests of disputed Taxes, the purchasing Party shall be liable for and
the providing Party may collect from the purchasing Party any Tax, including any interest or penalties for which the purchasing
Party would be liable under this subsection, which is assessed or collected by the respective Governmental Authority; provided,
however, that the providing Party notifies the purchasing Party of such assessment or collection within the earlier of (i) sixty (60)
calendar days following the running of the applicable statute of limitations period for assessment or collection of such Tax,
including extensions, or (ii) six (6) years following the purchasing Party’s payment for the products or services to which such Tax
relates.
34.2 With respect to any purchase under this Agreement of products or services that are resold by the purchasing Party to a Third
Party or used as a component part of or integrated into a product or service sold to a Third Party, if any Tax is imposed on or
with respect to such sale by the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall pay or remit such Tax to the respective
Governmental Authority. If the purchasing Party fails to pay or remit any Tax as required by Applicable Law, then, as between
the providing Party and the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall remain liable for such Tax and any interest and
penalties thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the purchasing Party agrees to protect, indemnify and
hold harmless (and defend at the purchasing Party’s expense) the providing Party from and against any Tax, any interest or
penalties thereon, and any costs or expenses (including attorney fees) incurred by the providing Party as a result of any claim
asserted or actions taken by the respective Governmental Authority to assess against or collect from the providing Party any Tax
related to any sale by the purchasing Party to a third Party.
34.3 To the extent a purchase of products or services under this Agreement is claimed by the purchasing Party to be for resale or
otherwise exempt from a Tax, the purchasing Party shall furnish to the providing Party an exemption certificate in the form
prescribed by the providing Party and any other information or documentation required by Applicable Law or the respective
Governmental Authority. Prior to receiving such exemption certificate and any such other required information or documentation,
the Providing Party shall have the right to bill, and the Purchasing Party shall pay, Tax on any products or services furnished
hereunder as if no exemption were available, subject to the right of the Purchasing Party to pursue a claim for credit or refund of
any such Tax pursuant to the provisions of this Section 34.0 and the remedies available under Applicable Law. If it is the
position of the purchasing Party that Applicable Law exempts or excludes a purchase of products or services under this
Agreement from a Tax, or that the Tax otherwise does not apply to such a purchase, but Applicable Law does not also provide a
specific procedure for claiming such exemption or exclusion or for the purchaser to contest the application of the Tax directly with
the respective Governmental Authority prior to payment, then the providing Party may in its discretion agree not to bill and/or not
to require payment of such Tax by the purchasing Party, provided that the purchasing Party (i) furnishes the providing Party with
any exemption certificate requested by and in the form prescribed by the providing Party, (ii) furnishes the providing Party with a
letter signed by an officer of the purchasing Party setting forth the basis of the purchasing Party’s position under Applicable Law;
and (iii) furnishes the providing Party with an indemnification agreement, reasonably acceptable to the providing Party, which
holds the providing Party harmless from any Tax, interest, penalties, loss, cost or expenses (including attorney fees) that may be
incurred by the providing Party in connection with any claim asserted or actions taken by the respective Governmental Authority
to assess or collect such Tax from the providing Party.
34.4 To the extent permitted by and pursuant to Applicable Law, and subject to the provisions of this Section 34.0, the purchasing
Party shall have the right to contest with the respective Governmental Authority, or if necessary under Applicable Law to have
the providing Party contest (in either case at the purchasing Party’s expense) any Tax that the purchasing Party asserts is not
applicable, from which it claims an exemption or exclusion, or which it claims to have paid in error; provided, however, that (i) the
purchasing Party shall ensure that no lien is attached to any asset of the providing Party as a result of any contest of a disputed
Tax; (ii) with respect to any Tax that could be assessed against or collected from the providing Party by the respective
Governmental Authority, the providing Party shall retain the right to determine the manner of contesting such disputed Tax,
including but not limited to a decision that the disputed Tax will be contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund; (iii) except
to the extent that the providing Party has agreed pursuant to this Section 34.0 not to bill and/or not to require payment of such
Tax by the purchasing Party pending the outcome of such contest, the purchasing Party pays any such Tax previously billed by
the providing Party and continues paying such Tax as billed by the providing Party pending the outcome of such contest. In the
event that a disputed Tax is to be contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund, if requested in writing by the purchasing
Party, the providing Party shall facilitate such contest (i) by assigning to the purchasing Party its right to claim a credit or refund,

if such an assignment is permitted under Applicable Law; or (ii) if an assignment is not permitted, by filing and pursuing the claim
on behalf of the purchasing Party but at the purchasing Party’s expense. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section
34.0, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair, limit, restrict or otherwise affect the right of the providing Party to
contest a Tax that could be assessed against or collected from it by the respective Governmental Authority. With respect to any
contest of a disputed Tax resulting in a refund, credit or other recovery, as between the purchasing Party and the providing Party,
the purchasing Party shall be entitled to the amount that it previously paid, plus any applicable interest allowed on the recovery
that is attributable to such amount, and the providing Party shall be entitled to all other amounts.
34.5 If either Party is audited by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority with respect to a Tax, and in any contest of a Tax by either
Party, the other Party shall cooperate fully and timely by providing records, testimony and such additional information or
assistance as may reasonably be necessary to expeditiously resolve the audit or pursue the contest.
34.6 All Notices, affidavits, exemption certificates or other communications required or permitted to be given by either Party to the
other under this Section 34.0 shall be sent in accordance with Section 20.0 above hereof.

report its access lines to the Texas Public Utility Commission, will remit the related payments to municipalities, and will otherwise
comply with Chapter 283 and applicable P.U.C rules, as they may be amended from time to time. CLEC agrees that its failure to
comply with all chapter 283 requirements, including any failure to provide AT&T-22STATE with a valid Adequate Proof
Agreement acknowledging CLEC's obligation to pay Municipal Fees within thirty (30) days of AT&T-22STATE’s request, shall be
considered a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle AT&T-22STATE to any and all remedies provided elsewhere in
this Agreement for such a breach, including, but not limited to suspension of all order processing (other than disconnect orders).
35.0 Non Waiver
35.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent to any default
under this Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and properly executed by or on behalf of the Party against
whom such waiver or consent is claimed. Waiver by either Party of any default by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver
of any other default. Failure of either Party to insist on performance of any term or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any
right or privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or future waiver of such term, condition, right or privilege. No
course of dealing or failure of any Party to strictly enforce any term, right, or condition of this Agreement in any instance shall be
construed as a general waiver or relinquishment of such term, right or condition.
36.0 Network Maintenance and Management

management center.
36.3 Each Party maintains the right to implement protective network traffic management controls, such as “cancel to”, “call gapping” or
seven (7)-digit and ten (10)-digit code gaps, to selectively cancel the completion of traffic over its network, including traffic
destined for the other Party’s network, when required to protect the public-switched network from congestion as a result of
occurrences such as facility failures, switch congestion or failure or focused overload. Each Party shall immediately notify the
other Party of any protective control action planned or executed.
36.4 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be implemented by either Party to temporarily relieve
network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling patterns. Reroutes shall not be used to circumvent normal trunk
servicing. Expansive controls shall be used only when mutually agreed to by the Parties.
36.5 The Parties shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding cross-network call-ins expected to generate large or
focused temporary increases in call volumes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events on the public-switched network,
including any disruption or loss of service to the other Party’s End Users. Facsimile (FAX) numbers must be exchanged by the
Parties to facilitate event notifications for planned mass calling events.

3.0 Network Interconnection Methods
3.1 The Interconnection provided herein may not be used solely for the purpose of originating a Party’s own
interexchange traffic.
3.2 Network Interconnection Architecture Plan:
3.2.1 AT&T-22STATE’s network is partly comprised of End Office Switches, Local Only Tandem
Switches (AT&T-10STATE), Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switches, Local/Access Tandem Switches,
and Access Tandem Switches. AT&T-22STATE’s network architecture in any given local
Exchange Area and/or LATA can vary markedly from another local Exchange Area/LATA. Using
one or more of the NIMs herein, the Parties will agree to a physical architecture plan for a specific
Interconnection area. A physical architecture plan will, at a minimum, include the location of
CLEC’s switch(es) and AT&T-22STATE’s End Office Switch(es) and/or Tandem Switch(es) to be
interconnected, the facilities that will connect the two (2) networks and which Party will provide (be
financially responsible for) the Interconnection facilities. At the time of implementation in a given
local Exchange Area or LATA the plan will be documented and signed by appropriate
representatives of the Parties, indicating their mutual agreement to the physical architecture plan.
3.2.2 The Parties may utilize any method of Interconnection described in this Attachment. Unless
otherwise specified in this Attachment, each Party is financially responsible for the provisioning of
facilities on its side of the negotiated POI(s). Each Party is responsible for the appropriate sizing,
operation, and maintenance of the transport facility to its side of the POI(s). The Parties agree to
provide sufficient facilities for the trunk groups required in Section 4.0 below for the exchange of
traffic between CLEC and AT&T-22STATE.
3.2.2.1 For each NXX code used by either Party, the Party that owns the NXX (or pooled code
block) must maintain network facilities (whether owned or leased) used to actively
provide, in part, local Telecommunications Service in the geographic area assigned to
such NXX code. If either Party uses its NXX Code to provide Foreign Exchange (FX)
service to its customers outside of the geographic area assigned to such code, that
Party shall be solely responsible to transport traffic between its Foreign Exchange
service customers and such code’s geographic area.

3.2.3 Types of Points of Interconnection:
3.2.3.1 A “Tandem Serving Area (TSA)” is an AT&T-22STATE area defined by the sum of all
local calling areas served by AT&T-22STATE End Offices that subtend an AT&T-
22STATE Tandem for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic as defined in the LERG.
3.2.3.2 The Parties will interconnect their network facilities at a minimum of one CLEC
designated POI within AT&T-22STATE’s network in the LATA where CLEC Offers
Service.
3.2.3.3 A “Single POI” is a single point of Interconnection within a LATA on AT&T-22STATE’s
network that is established to interconnect AT&T-22STATE’s network and CLEC’s
network for the exchange of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
3.2.3.4 The Parties agree that CLEC has the right to choose a Single POI or multiple POIs.
3.2.3.5 When CLEC has established a Single POI (or multiple POIs) in a LATA, CLEC agrees to
establish an additional POI:
3.2.3.5.1 at an AT&T-22STATE TSA separate from the existing POI arrangement
when traffic through the existing POI arrangement to that AT&T-22STATE
TSA exceeds twenty-four (24) DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive
months, or
3.2.3.5.2 at an AT&T-22STATE End Office in a local calling area not served by an
AT&T-22STATE Tandem for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic when
traffic through the existing POI arrangement to that local calling area
exceeds twenty-four (24) DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive months.
3.2.3.6 The additional POI(s) will be established within ninety (90) calendar days of notification
that the threshold has been met.
3.2.4 A Party seeking to change the physical architecture plan shall provide thirty (30) calendar days
advance written Notice of such intent. After Notice is served, the normal project planning process
as described in Section 3.0 above will be followed for all physical architecture plan changes.
3.2.5 CLEC is solely responsible, including financially, for the facilities that carry OS/DA, E911, Mass
Calling, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups.
3.2.6 Technical Interfaces
3.2.6.1 The Interconnection facilities provided by each Party shall be formatted using either
Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) line code with Superframe format framing or Bipolar 8-
Zero Substitution with Extended Superframe (B8ZS ESF) format framing or any mutually
agreeable line coding and framing.
3.3 Methods of Interconnection:
3.3.1 Physical and Virtual Collocation - Attachment 12 - Collocation describes the terms and conditions
for Interconnection via Collocation.

3.3.2 Fiber Meet Point:
3.3.2.1 Fiber Meet Point between AT&T-22STATE and CLEC can occur at any mutually
agreeable and technically feasible point at an AT&T-22STATE Tandem or End Office
building within each LATA.
3.3.2.2 When the Parties agree to Interconnect their networks pursuant to the Fiber Meet Point,
a single point-to-point linear chain SONET system must be utilized (in a Unidirectional
Path Switched Ring (UPSR) software configuration for AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE). Only Local Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be provisioned over this jointly
provided facility.
3.3.2.3 Neither Party will be allowed to access the Data Communications Channel (DCC) of the
other Party’s Fiber Optic Terminal (FOT). The Fiber Meet Point will be designed so that
each Party may, as far as is technically feasible, independently select the transmission,
multiplexing, and fiber terminating equipment to be used on its side of the POI(s). The
Parties will work cooperatively to achieve equipment and vendor compatibility of the
FOT equipment.
3.3.2.4 Requirements for Interconnection specifications will be defined in joint engineering
planning sessions between the Parties.
3.3.2.5 In addition to the semi-annual trunk forecast process, discussed in Section 4.0 below,
discussions to provide relief to existing facilities can be initiated by either Party. Actual
system augmentations will be initiated only upon mutual agreement. Facilities will be
planned to accommodate the verified and agreed upon trunk forecast for the Local
Interconnection Trunk Group(s).
3.3.2.6 The Parties will negotiate a project service date and corresponding work schedule to
construct relief facilities prior to facilities exhaust.
3.3.2.7 CLEC will provide fiber cable to the last entrance (or AT&T-22STATE designated)
manhole at the AT&T-22STATE Tandem or End Office building. AT&T-22STATE shall
make all necessary preparations in the manhole to receive and to allow and enable
CLEC to deliver fiber optic facilities into that manhole. CLEC will provide a sufficient
length of fiber cable for AT&T-22STATE to pull through to the AT&T-22STATE cable
vault. CLEC shall deliver and maintain such strands at its own expense up to the POI.
AT&T shall take the fiber from the manhole and terminate it inside AT&T-22STATE’s
Tandem or End Office building at the cable vault at AT&T-22STATE’s expense. In this
case, the POI shall be at the AT&T-22STATE designated manhole location. Each Party
shall provide its own source for the synchronized timing of its FOT equipment.
3.3.2.8 CLEC and AT&T-22STATE will mutually agree on the capacity of the FOT(s) to be
utilized based on equivalent DS1s or DS3s. Each Party will also agree upon the optical
frequency and wavelength necessary to implement the Interconnection. The Parties will
develop and agree upon methods for the capacity planning and management for these
facilities, terms and conditions for over provisioning facilities, and the necessary
processes to implement facilities as indicated in Section 4.0 below of this document.
3.3.2.9 Electrical handoffs for Fiber Meet Point will be at the DS1 or DS3 level. When a DS3
handoff is agreed to by the Parties, AT&T-22STATE will provide any multiplexing

required for DS1 facilities or trunking at its end and CLEC will provide any DS1
multiplexing required for facilities or trunking at its end.
3.4 Responsibilities of the Parties:
3.4.1 For each local Interconnection within an AT&T-22STATE area, CLEC shall provide written notice
to AT&T-22STATE of the need to establish Interconnection in each local Exchange Area (AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE) or LATA (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT).
CLEC shall provide all applicable network information on forms acceptable to AT&T-22STATE (as
set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC Handbook, published on the AT&T CLEC OnLine website).
3.4.2 Upon receipt of CLEC’s Notice to interconnect, the Parties shall schedule a meeting to document
the network architecture (including trunking) as discussed in Section 3.2.1 above. The
Interconnection Activation Date for an Interconnection shall be established based on then-existing
force and load, the scope and complexity of the requested Interconnection and other relevant
factors.
3.4.3 Either Party may add or remove switches. The Parties shall provide 120 calendar days written
Notice to establish such Interconnection; and the terms and conditions of this Attachment will apply
to such Interconnection.
3.4.4 The Parties recognize that a facility handoff point must be agreed upon to establish the
demarcation point for maintenance and provisioning responsibilities for each Party on its side of the
POI.
4.0 Interconnection Trunking
4.1 Provisioning and Administration of Trunk Groups:
4.1.1 CLEC shall issue ASRs for two-way trunk groups and for one-way trunk groups originating at
CLEC’s switch. AT&T-22STATE shall issue ASRs for one-way trunk groups originating at the
AT&T-22STATE switch.
4.1.2 Trunk groups for ancillary services (e.g., OS/DA, BLVI, High Volume Call In, and E911) and Meet
Point or Third Party (as appropriate) Trunk Groups can be established between CLEC’s switch and
the appropriate AT&T-22STATE Tandem Switch as further provided in this Section 4.0.
4.1.3 Signaling Protocol:
4.1.3.1 SS7 Signaling is AT&T-22STATE’s preferred method for signaling. Where MF signaling
is currently used, the Parties agree to use their best efforts to convert to SS7. If SS7
services are provided by AT&T-22STATE, they will be provided in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable access tariffs.
4.1.3.2 Where MF signaling is currently used, the Parties agree to interconnect their networks
using MF or dual tone MF (DTMF) signaling, subject to availability at the End Office
Switch or Tandem Switch at which Interconnection occurs. The Parties acknowledge
that the use of MF signaling may not be optimal. AT&T-22STATE will not be
responsible for correcting any undesirable characteristics, service problems or
performance problems that are associated with MF/SS7 inter-working or the signaling
protocol required for Interconnection with CLEC employing MF signaling.

4.2 Embedded Base-One-Way trunks (AT&T-12STATE only):
4.2.1 AT&T-12STATE acknowledges that CLEC may have an embedded base of one-way trunks
ordered and installed prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement that were used for termination of
CLEC’s Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic to AT&T-12STATE (Embedded Base). To the
extent that CLEC has such an Embedded Base, CLEC shall only augment trunk groups in the
Embedded Base with the mutual agreement of the Parties. CLEC shall not order any new one-way
trunk groups following the Effective Date of this Agreement. Moreover, the Parties agree that the
Embedded Base will be converted to two-way trunk groups under the following circumstances:
4.2.1.1 With reasonable notification from AT&T-12STATE, and upon AT&T-12STATE’s
request, CLEC shall convert all of its Embedded Base to two-way trunks.
4.2.1.2 At any time an Embedded Base trunk group (either originating or terminating) requires
augmentation, AT&T-12STATE can require the associated originating and terminating
trunks to be converted to a single two-way trunk group prior to the augmentation.
4.2.1.3 When any network changes are to be performed on a project basis (i.e., central office
conversions, tandem re-homes, etc.), upon request and reasonable notice by AT&T-
12STATE, CLEC will convert all of its Embedded Base affected by the project within the
intervals and due dates required by the project parameters.
4.2.1.4 In addition to the foregoing, CLEC may choose, at any time, to convert its Embedded
Base to two-way trunk groups.
4.2.1.5 The Parties will coordinate any trunk group migration, trunk group prioritization, and
implementation schedule. AT&T-12STATE agrees to develop a cutover plan within
thirty (30) days of notification to CLEC of the need to convert pursuant to Section 4.2.1.1
above and Section 4.2.1.3 above.
4.3 Establishment of Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Groups Per Region:
4.3.1 When CLEC Offers Service in a Local Exchange Area or LATA, the following trunk groups
described in this Section 4.3 shall be used to transport traffic between CLEC End Users and
AT&T-22STATE End Users.
4.3.2 Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each Local Exchange Area: AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. These trunk groups will utilize SS7 where available and multi-
frequency (MF) signaling protocol where SS7 is not available.

Tandem switching is not provided.
4.3.2.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE reserves the right to initiate a one-way
IntraLATA Trunk Group to CLEC in order to provide Tandem relief when a community of
interest is outside the local Exchange Area in which CLEC is interconnected.
4.3.2.4 Where traffic from CLEC switch to an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End
Office is sufficient (24 or more trunks), a Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall also
be established to the AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office. Once such
trunks are provisioned, traffic from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE
must be redirected to route first to the Direct End Office Trunk Group (DEOT) with
overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. If an AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic, a
direct final DEOT will be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.3.2.5 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s switch to each
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office in a local Exchange Area that has

Tandem switches in AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and at the
Access Tandem Switches in AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE in the LATA,
for calls destined to or from End Offices that subtend each Tandem.
4.3.3.1.3 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s
switch to each AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and each AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE End Office in any LATA where the AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE End Office does
not subtend an AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE Local Tandem. This trunk group shall be established as
a direct final.
4.3.3.2 Tandem Trunking – AT&T CONNECTICUT
4.3.3.2.1 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups established at all AT&T CONNECTICUT
Access Tandems in the LATA for calls destined to or from all AT&T
CONNECTICUT End Offices that subtend the designated Tandem. These
trunk groups shall be one-way and will utilize SS7 signaling.
4.3.3.2.2 Local Interconnection Trunk Groups in AT&T CONNECTICUT shall be
ordered and provisioned as one-way to accommodate billing and technical
limitations.
4.3.3.3 Tandem Trunking – AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE
4.3.3.3.1 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups established at each AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem in the LATA where CLEC homes its
NPA/NXX codes for calls destined to or from all AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE End Offices that subtend the designated Tandem.
These trunk groups shall be one-way except where two-way trunks have
been mutually agreed and will utilize SS7 signaling. Where CLEC does not
interconnect at every Access Tandem switch location in the LATA, CLEC
must use Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic to End Users
through those Tandems within the LATA to which CLEC is not
interconnected. To utilize MTA, CLEC must establish Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups to a minimum of one (1) Access Tandem within each LATA
as required. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will route CLEC
originated 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll traffic for LATA-wide transport and
termination. Compensation for MTA is described in Section 6.2.9 below.
4.3.4 Direct End Office Trunking
4.3.4.1 DEOTs transport Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic between CLEC’s switch and
an AT&T-22STATE End Office and are not switched at a Tandem location. When
actual or projected End Office Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic requires twenty-
four (24) or more trunks CLEC shall establish the following:
4.3.4.1.1 a two-way DEOT in AT&T-12STATE,
4.3.4.1.2 a one-way DEOT in AT&T CONNECTICUT,

the parties have agreed to use two-way trunks.)
4.3.4.2 Once such trunks are provisioned, traffic from CLEC to AT&T-22STATE must be
redirected to route first to the DEOT with overflow traffic alternate routed to the
appropriate AT&T-22STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic. If an AT&T-22STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T-22STATE
Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic, a direct final DEOT will
be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA
Toll Traffic.
4.3.4.3 All traffic received by AT&T-22STATE on the DEOT from CLEC must terminate in the
End Office, i.e. no Tandem switching will be performed in the End Office. Where End
Office functionality is provided in a remote End Office switch of a host/remote
configuration, CLEC shall establish the DEOT at the host switch.
4.3.5 Meet Point Trunk Group: AT&T-13STATE
4.3.5.1 IXC carried traffic shall be transported between CLEC’s switch and the AT&T-13STATE
Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch over a Meet Point Trunk Group
separate from Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The Meet Point Trunk Group will
be established for the transmission and routing of exchange access traffic between
CLEC’s End Users and IXCs via an AT&T-13STATE Access Tandem Switch or
Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.5.2 Meet Point Trunk Groups shall be provisioned as two-way, and each Party is
responsible for delivering traffic utilizing SS7 signaling, except MF signaling will be used
on a separate Meet Point Trunk Group to complete originating calls to switched access
customers that use MF FGD signaling protocol.
4.3.5.3 When AT&T-13STATE has more than one Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch in a
local exchange area or LATA, CLEC shall establish a Meet Point Trunk Group to every
AT&T-13STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch where CLEC has homed its
NXX code(s) or is the code holder of a pooled code block.
4.3.5.4 AT&T-13STATE will not block switched access traffic delivered to any AT&T-13STATE
Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch for completion on CLEC’s
network. The Parties understand and agree that Meet Point trunking arrangements are
available and functional only to/from switched access customers who directly connect
with any AT&T-13STATE Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch that
CLEC’s switch subtends in each LATA. In no event will AT&T-13STATE be required to
route such traffic through more than one of its Tandem Switches for connection to/from
switched access customers. AT&T-13STATE shall have no responsibility to ensure that
any switched access customer will accept traffic that CLEC directs to the switched
access customer.
4.3.5.5 CLEC shall provide all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, charge
number and originating line information (OLI). For terminating FGD, AT&T-13STATE
will pass all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, Calling Party Number
(CPN) if it receives CPN from FGD carriers. All privacy indicators will be honored.
Where available, network signaling information such as transit network selection (TNS)

parameter, carrier identification codes (CIC) (CCS platform) and CIC/OZZ information
(non SS7 environment) will be provided by CLEC wherever such information is needed
for call routing or billing. The Parties will follow all Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF)
adopted standards pertaining to TNS and CIC/OZZ codes.
4.3.5.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic
shall be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the
terminating Party’s access tariff(s).
4.3.6 Third Party Trunk Group: AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE
4.3.6.1 Third Party Traffic trunks shall be two-way trunks and must be ordered by CLEC to
deliver and receive Third Party Traffic. Establishing Third Party Traffic trunks at Access
and Local Tandems provides Intra-Tandem Access to the Third Party also
interconnected at those Tandems. CLEC shall be responsible for all recurring and
nonrecurring charges associated with Third Party Traffic trunks and facilities.
4.3.7 800/(8YY) Traffic: AT&T-22STATE
4.3.7.1 If CLEC chooses AT&T-22STATE to handle 800/(8YY) database queries from AT&T-
22STATE’s switches, all CLEC originating 800/(8YY) traffic will be routed over the Meet
Point Trunk Groups or the Third Party Trunk Groups. This traffic will include a
combination of both IXC 800/(8YY) service and CLEC 800/(8YY) service which will be
identified and segregated by carrier through the database query function in the AT&T-
22STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.7.2 Where CLEC requests that AT&T-22STATE perform the Service Switching Point (SSP)
function (e.g. the database query) on originating Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls, all
such calls shall be delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk Group or
over the Third Party Trunk Group. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit Code (to be
determined for each LATA) shall be used for all such calls.
4.3.7.3 CLEC may handle its own 800/(8YY) database queries from its own switch. Where it
does so, CLEC will determine the nature of the 800/(8YY) call (local/intraLATA or IXC-
carried) based on the response from the database. If the query determines that the call
is a local or IntraLATA 800/(8YY) number, CLEC will route the post-query local or
IntraLATA converted ten-digit local number to AT&T-22STATE over the Local
Interconnection Trunk Group and shall provide an 800/(8YY) billing Record to AT&T-
22STATE . If the query reveals the call is an IXC-carried 800/(8YY) number, CLEC
shall route the post-query IXC-carried call (800/(8YY) number) directly from its switch for
carriers interconnected with its network or over the Meet Point Trunk Group or Third
Party Trunk Group, as appropriate, to carriers not directly connected to its network but
which are connected to AT&T-22STATE’s Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
Calls will be routed to AT&T-22STATE over the appropriate trunk group as defined
above, within the LATA in which the calls originate.
4.3.7.4 All post-query Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC performs the SSP
function, if delivered to AT&T-22STATE, shall be delivered using GR-394 format over
the Meet Point Trunk Group or over the Third Party Trunk Group for calls destined to
IXCs, or shall be delivered by CLEC using GR-317 format over the Local Only and/or

the Tandem.
4.3.8 E911 Trunk Group:
4.3.8.1 Attachment 05 - 911/E911 specifies E911 trunk group requirements.
4.3.9 High Volume Call In (HVCI)/Mass Calling (Choke) Trunk Group: AT&T-21STATE
4.3.9.1 CLEC must establish a dedicated trunk group to the designated Public Response
HVCI/Mass Calling Network Access Tandem in each Serving Area. This trunk group
shall be one-way outgoing only and shall utilize MF signaling. As the HVCI/Mass
Calling trunk group is designed to block all excessive attempts toward HVCI/Mass
Calling NXXs, it is necessarily exempt from the one percent (1%) blocking standard
described elsewhere in this Attachment. CLEC will have administrative control for the
purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group. The Parties will not exchange
live traffic until successful testing is completed by both Parties.
4.3.9.1.1 Upon demonstration that the CLEC switch is unable to utilize MF signaling,
the CLEC may utilize SS7 signaling for its HVCI/Mass Calling Trunk Group.
4.3.9.2 The HVCI trunk group shall be sized as follows:
Number of Access Lines Served Number of Mass Calling Trunks
0 – 10,000 2
10,001 – 20,000 3
20,001 – 30,000 4
30,001 – 40,000 5
40,001 – 50,000 6
50,001 – 60,000 7
60,001 – 75,000 8
75,000 + 9 maximum
4.3.9.3 If CLEC should acquire a HVCI/Mass Calling customer, e.g. a radio station, CLEC shall
notify AT&T-21STATE at least sixty (60) days in advance of the need to establish a
one-way outgoing SS7 or MF trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE HVCI/Mass Calling
Serving Office to the CLEC End User’s serving office. CLEC will have administrative
control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.

4.3.9.4 If CLEC finds it necessary to issue a new choke telephone number to a new or existing
HVCI/Mass Calling customer, CLEC may request a meeting to coordinate with AT&T-
21STATE the assignment of the HVCI/Mass Calling telephone number from the existing
choke NXX. In the event that the CLEC establishes a new choke NXX, CLEC must
notify AT&T-21STATE a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to deployment of the new
HVCI/Mass Calling NXX. AT&T-21STATE will perform the necessary translations in its
End Offices and Tandem(s) and issue ASRs to establish a one-way outgoing SS7 or MF
trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE Public Response HVCI/Mass Calling Network
Access Tandem to CLEC’s choke serving office.
4.3.9.5 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, where HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs have not been established,
the Parties agree to utilize “call gapping” as the method to control high volumes of calls,
where technically feasible in the originating switch, to specific high volume customers or
in situations such as those described in Network Maintenance and Management of the
General Terms and Conditions.
4.3.10 Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services Trunk Group(s):
4.3.10.1 Attachment 06 - Customer Information Services specifies the trunk group requirements
for Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services.
4.4 Trunk Forecasting Responsibilities:
4.4.1 CLEC agrees to provide an initial forecast for all trunk groups described in this Attachment. AT&T-
22STATE shall review this trunk forecast and provide any additional information that may impact
the trunk forecast information provided by CLEC. Subsequent trunk forecasts shall be provided on
a semi-annual basis, not later than January 1st and July 1st of each year in order to be considered
in the semi-annual publication of the AT&T-22STATE General Trunk Forecast. Parties agree to
the use of Common Language Location Identification (CLLI) coding and Common Language Circuit
Identification for Message Trunk coding (CLCI-MSG) which is described in TELCORDIA
TECHNOLOGIES documents BR795-100-100 and BR795-400-100 respectively. Inquiries
pertaining to use of TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Common Language Standards and document
availability should be directed to TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-2673.
4.4.2 The semi-annual forecasts shall include:
4.4.2.1 Yearly forecasted trunk quantities for all trunk groups required in this Attachment for a
minimum of three (3) (current plus two (2) future) years; and
4.4.2.2 A description of major network projects anticipated for the next six (6) months. Major
network projects include trunking or network rearrangements, shifts in anticipated traffic
patterns, orders greater than eight (8) DS1s, or other activities that are reflected by a
significant increase or decrease in trunking demand for the following forecasting period.
4.4.2.3 The Parties shall agree on these forecasts to ensure efficient trunk utilization. For
forecast quantities that are in dispute, the Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to
develop a mutually agreeable forecast.
4.4.2.4 Orders for trunks that exceed forecasted quantities for forecasted locations will be
accommodated as mutually agreed to by the Parties. The Parties shall make all
reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to develop alternative solutions to
accommodate these orders.

4.6 Trunk Servicing
4.6.1 Both Parties will jointly manage the capacity of Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and
Meet Point Trunk Groups. Either Party may send a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to the
other Party to trigger changes to the Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point
Trunk Groups based on capacity assessment. The TGSR is a standard industry support interface
developed by the OBF of the Carrier Liaison Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications
Solutions (ATIS) organization. TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Special Report STS000316
describes the format and use of the TGSR. Contact TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-
2673 regarding the documentation availability and use of this form.
4.6.2 Orders greater than eight (8) DS1s shall be submitted as a project as described in Section 4.7
below.
4.6.3 Utilization: Utilization shall be defined as Trunks required as a percentage of Trunks in Service.
4.6.3.1 In A Blocking Situation (Over-utilization)
4.6.3.1.1 In a blocking situation, CLEC is responsible for issuing ASRs on all two-way
Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk
Groups and one-way CLEC originating Local Only and/or Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured blocking to design
objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an ASR
is not issued, AT&T-22STATE will issue a TGSR. CLEC will issue an ASR
within three (3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR. CLEC
will note “Service Affecting” on the ASR.
4.6.3.1.2 In a blocking situation, AT&T-22STATE is responsible for issuing ASRs on
one-way AT&T-22STATE originating Local Only and/or Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured blocking to design
objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an ASR
is not issued, CLEC will issue a TGSR. AT&T-22STATE will issue an ASR
within three (3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR.
4.6.3.1.3 If an alternate final Local Only Trunk Group or Local Interconnection Trunk
Group is at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to
CLEC for the final trunk group and all subtending high usage trunk groups
that are contributing any amount of overflow to the alternate final route.
4.6.3.1.4 If a direct final Meet Point Trunk Group is at seventy-five percent (75%)
utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC. If a direct final Third Party Trunk
Group is at ninety percent (90%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC.
4.6.3.2 Underutilization
4.6.3.2.1 Underutilization of Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups, Third Party Trunk Group and Meet Point Trunk Groups exists when

Page 19 of 43
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
provisioned capacity is greater than the current need. Those situations
where more capacity exists than actual usage requires will be handled in
the following manner:
4.6.3.2.1.1 If a Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk
Group, Third Party Trunk Group or a Meet Point Trunk
Group is under sixty-five percent (65%) of CCS capacity on
a monthly average basis for AT&T-13STATE or under
eighty percent (80%) for AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE, for each month of any three (3) consecutive
months period, either Party may request the issuance of an
order to resize the Local Only Trunk Group, Local
Interconnection Trunk Group, Third Party Trunk Group or
the Meet Point Trunk Group, which shall be left with not
less than twenty-five percent (25%) excess capacity for
AT&T-13STATE or not less than fifteen percent (15%) for
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. In all cases,
grade of service objectives shall be maintained.
4.6.3.2.1.2 Either Party may send a TGSR to the other Party to trigger
changes to the Local Only Trunk Groups, Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups, Third Party Trunk Groups or
Meet Point Trunk Groups based on capacity assessment.
Upon receipt of a TGSR, the receiving Party will issue an
ASR to the other Party within twenty (20) business days
after receipt of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.3 Upon review of the TGSR, if a Party does not agree with
the resizing, the Parties will schedule a joint planning
discussion within the twenty (20) business days. The
Parties will meet to resolve and mutually agree to the
disposition of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.4 If AT&T-22STATE does not receive an ASR, or if CLEC
does not respond to the TGSR by scheduling a joint
discussion within the twenty (20) business day period,
AT&T-22STATE will attempt to contact CLEC to schedule
a joint planning discussion. If CLEC will not agree to meet
within an additional five (5) business days and present
adequate reason for keeping trunks operational, AT&T-
22STATE reserves the right to issue ASRs to resize the
Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups, Third Party Trunk Groups or Meet Point Trunk
Groups.
4.6.4 The Parties will process trunk service requests submitted via a properly completed ASR within ten
(10) business days of receipt of such ASR unless defined as a major project. Incoming orders will
be screened by AT&T-22STATE for reasonableness based upon current utilization and/or
consistency with forecasts. If the nature and necessity of an order requires determination, the ASR
will be placed in held status, and a joint planning discussion conducted. The Parties agree to

expedite this discussion in order to minimize delay in order processing. Extension of this review
and discussion process beyond two (2) Business Days from ASR receipt will require the ordering
Party to supplement the order with proportionally adjusted Customer Desired Due Dates. Facilities
must also be in place before trunk orders can be completed.
4.7 Projects:
4.7.1 Projects require the coordination and execution of multiple orders or related activities between and
among AT&T-22STATE and CLEC work groups, including but not limited to the initial
establishment of Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party or Meet Point Trunk Groups and
service in an area, NXX code moves, rehomes, facility grooming, or network rearrangements.
4.7.1.1 Orders that comprise a project, i.e. greater than eight (8) DS1s, shall be submitted at the
same time, and their implementation shall be jointly planned and coordinated.
4.7.2 Projects -Tandem Rehomes/Switch Conversion/Major Network Projects:
4.7.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will advise CLEC of all projects significantly affecting CLEC trunking.
Such projects may include Tandem Rehomes, Switch Conversions and other major
network changes. An Accessible Letter with project details will be issued at least six (6)
months prior to the project due dates. AT&T-22STATE may follow with a TGSR
approximately four (4) to six (6) months before the due date of the project. A separate
TGSR will be issued for each CLEC trunk group and will specify the required CLEC ASR
issue date. Failure to submit ASR(s) by the required date may result in AT&T-22STATE
ceasing to deliver traffic until the ASR(s) are received and processed.
5.0 Out of Exchange Traffic
5.1.1 Interconnection services are available in accordance with Section 251(a)(1) of the Act for the
purposes of exchanging traffic to/from a non-AT&T-22STATE incumbent exchange in accordance
with this Section 5.0.
5.1.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-22STATE is only obligated to make available
Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) of the Act to CLEC at technically feasible points within
AT&T-22STATE’s network and not in locations, such as territories of other ILECs, where AT&T-
22STATE does not maintain a network. Other Attachments to this Agreement set forth the terms
and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE agrees to provide CLEC with access to
Unbundled Network Elements under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under Section
251z(c)(6) of the Act and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) of the Act in AT&T-22STATE’s
incumbent local Exchange Areas for the provision of CLEC’s Telecommunications Services.
5.1.3 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC intends to operate and/or provide Telecommunications
Services outside of AT&T-22STATE incumbent local Exchange Areas and desires to interconnect
OE-LEC’s network with AT&T-22STATE’s network(s).
5.1.4 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC agrees to interconnect with AT&T-22STATE pursuant to
Section 251(a) of the Act.
5.1.5 Network Connections For Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.1.5.1 OE-LEC represents that it operates as a CLEC within AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas
and has a POI located within AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas for the purpose of
providing telephone Exchange Service and Exchange Access in such AT&T-22STATE

Exchange Areas. Based upon the foregoing, the Parties agree that AT&T-22STATE’s
originating traffic will be delivered to OE-LEC’s existing POI arrangements in the LATA
where the traffic originates in accordance with the POI requirements set forth in this
Agreement. AT&T-22STATE will accept OE-LEC’s Out of Exchange Traffic at its
Tandem Switch over local interconnection facilities that currently exist or may exist in
the future between the Parties to or from OE-LEC’s out of Exchange Areas to or from
AT&T-22STATE’s End Offices. When such Out of Exchange Traffic is Section
251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that is exchanged between the End Users of
OE-LEC and AT&T-22STATE, the Parties agree to establish a direct End Office trunk
group when traffic levels exceed one DS1 (24 DS0s) to or from an AT&T-22STATE End
Office.
5.1.5.2 OE-LEC shall establish a trunk group for Out of Exchange Traffic from OE-LEC to each
AT&T-22STATE serving Tandem in a LATA. This requirement may be waived upon
mutual agreement of the Parties.
5.1.5.2.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, where CLEC does not
interconnect at every AT&T serving Tandem in a LATA, CLEC must use
Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic in accordance with Section
4.3.3.3.1 above.
5.1.5.3 Transport facilities for 911, Mass Calling, OS/DA, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk
Groups are the responsibility of OE-LEC from OE-LEC to the serving Tandem or
platform that provides each such service type.
5.1.5.4 OE-LEC shall route originating Out of Exchange Traffic to the serving Tandem as
defined by the Tandem owner in the LERG.
5.1.5.5 If AT&T-22STATE is not the serving Tandem as reflected in the LERG, the OE-LEC
shall route Out of Exchange Traffic directly to the serving AT&T-22STATE End Office.
5.1.5.6 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.0, for OE-LEC originated/AT&T-
22STATE terminated traffic or AT&T-22STATE originated/ OE-LEC terminated traffic, if
any such traffic is improperly routed by one Party over any trunk groups to the other
Party and/or not routed in accordance with this Section 5.0, the Parties will work
cooperatively to correct the problem.
5.1.5.7 AT&T-22STATE shall not compensate any Third Party Local Exchange Carrier and/or
Telecommunications Carrier for any traffic that is inappropriately routed to AT&T-
22STATE (as reflected in the LERG). The obligation to correctly route traffic also
includes traffic that is destined to End Offices that do not subtend an AT&T-22STATE
Tandem. Any compensation due AT&T-22STATE for such misrouted traffic shall be
paid by OE-LEC. AT&T-22STATE shall provide notice to OE-LEC pursuant to the
Notices provisions of this Agreement that such misrouting has occurred. In the notice,
OE-LEC shall be given thirty (30) calendar days to cure such misrouting.
5.1.5.8 Neither Party shall deliver traffic destined to terminate at the other Party’s End Office via
a Third Party ILEC’s End Office or Tandem.
5.1.5.9 Connection of a trunk group from OE-LEC to AT&T-22STATE’s Tandem(s) will provide
OE-LEC access to End Offices, IXCs, LECs, CMRS providers and NXXs which subtend

that Tandem(s). Connection of a trunk group from one Party to the other Party’s End
Office(s) will provide the connecting Party access only to the NXXs served by that
individual End Office(s) to which the connecting Party interconnects. Direct End Office
Trunk groups that connect the Parties End Office(s) shall provide the Parties access
only to the NXXs that are served by that End Office(s).
5.1.5.9.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OE-LEC does not choose
Access Tandem interconnection at every AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE Access Tandem within a LATA, OE-LEC must utilize AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s MTA Interconnection. To utilize MTA,
OE-LEC must establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at a minimum of
one AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem within each
LATA as required.
5.1.5.10 AT&T-22STATE will open OE-LEC NPA-NXX codes, rated to or identified to reside in
non-AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas, in AT&T-22STATE Tandems and End Offices
using AT&T-22STATE’s standard code opening timeframes.
5.1.6 Intercarrier Compensation for Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.1.6.1 The compensation arrangement for Out of Exchange Traffic exchanged between the
Parties is described in Section 6.0 below.
5.1.7 InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic:
5.1.7.1 AT&T-22STATE will exchange AT&T-22STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic
that is covered by an FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver.
AT&T-22STATE will exchange such traffic using two-way direct final trunk groups (i) via
a facility to OE-LEC’s POI in the originating LATA, or (ii) via a facility meet point
arrangement at or near the Exchange Area Boundary (EAB), (iii) via a mutually agreed
to meet point facility within the AT&T-22STATE Exchange Area covered under such
InterLATA waiver, or (iv) via another mutually agreeable method. If the exchange where
the traffic is terminating is not an AT&T-22STATE exchange, AT&T-22STATE shall
exchange such traffic using a two-way Direct Final (DF) trunk group (i) via a facility to
OE-LEC’s POI within the originating LATA, (ii) via a mutually agreed to facility meet
point arrangement at or near the EAB, or (iii) via another mutually agreeable method.
AT&T-22STATE will not provision or be responsible for facilities located outside of
AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas.
5.1.7.2 The Parties agree that the AT&T-22STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) traffic from
each AT&T-22STATE End Office will not overflow to an alternate route.
5.1.7.3 OE-LEC must provide AT&T-22STATE a separate Access Customer Terminal Location

6.0 Intercarrier Compensation
6.1 Responsibilities of the Parties
6.1.1 For all traffic originated on a Party’s network including, without limitation, Switched Access Traffic,
such Party shall provide CPN as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1600(c) and in accordance with Section
PPaaggee 7734 ooff 453332 CCCS 73 of 424

Attachment 02 – ISP – Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 23 of 43
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
6.1.3 below. CPN shall, at a minimum, include information in an industry recognized standard
format, consistent with the requirements of the NANP containing an NPA and seven digit (NXX-
XXXX) telephone number. Each Party to this Agreement will be responsible for passing on any
CPN it receives from a Third Party for traffic delivered to the other Party. In addition, each Party
agrees that it shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign any CPN. If
either Party identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local Exchange Services (including,
but not limited to PRI, ISDN and/or Smart Trunks), or identifies stripped, altered, modified, added,
deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, the Parties agree to cooperate with one
another to investigate and take corrective action.
6.1.2 If one Party is passing CPN but the other Party is not properly receiving information, the Parties will
work cooperatively to correct the problem.
6.1.3 For traffic which is originated by one Party to be terminated on the other Party’s network in AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT, if the percentage of such calls passed with CPN is
greater than ninety percent (90%), all calls delivered by one Party to the other for termination
without CPN will be billed as either Section 251(b)(5) Traffic or IntraLATA Toll Traffic in direct
proportion to the total MOUs (MOUs) of calls delivered by one Party to the other with CPN. If the
percentage of calls passed with CPN is less than 90%, all calls delivered by one Party to the other
without CPN will be billed at Intrastate Switched Access rates.
6.1.4 For those CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE call usage based charges where actual
charge information is not determinable by AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction
(i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE traffic is
unidentifiable, the Parties will jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to
determine the appropriate charges to be billed to the CLEC in accordance with Section 6.12.2 or a
default factor of fifty percent (50%) will be applied.
6.1.5 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, each Party will report to the other Percent Interstate
Usage (PIU), Percent Local Usage (PLU) and Percent Local Facility (PLF) factors in order to
determine the appropriate charges to be billed to the originating Party in accordance with Section
6.12.3 below.
6.1.6 CLEC has the sole obligation to enter into compensation arrangements with all Third Parties with
whom CLEC exchanges traffic including without limitation anywhere CLEC originates traffic to or
terminates traffic from an End User being served by a Third Party who has purchased a local
switching product from AT&T-21STATE on a wholesale basis (non-resale) which is used by such
Telecommunications carrier to provide wireline local telephone Exchange Service (dial tone) to its
End Users. In no event will AT&T-21STATE have any liability to CLEC or any Third Party if CLEC
fails to enter into such compensation arrangements. In the event that traffic is exchanged with a
Third Party with whom CLEC does not have a traffic compensation agreement, CLEC will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-21STATE against any and all losses including without
limitation, charges levied by such Third Party. The Third Party and CLEC will bill their respective
charges directly to each other. AT&T-21STATE will not be required to function as a billing
intermediary, e.g., clearinghouse. AT&T-21STATE may provide information regarding such traffic
to Third Party carriers or entities as appropriate to resolve traffic compensation issues.

6.1.7 Notwithstanding the classification of traffic under this Attachment, either Party is free to define its
own “local” calling area(s) for purposes of its provision of Telecommunications services to its End
Users.
6.1.8 For Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, and IntraLATA Toll Traffic,
and Wholesale Local Switching Traffic in AT&T-12STATE, the Party whose End User originates
such traffic shall compensate the Party who terminates such traffic to its End User for the transport
and termination of such traffic at the applicable rate(s) provided in this Attachment and the Pricing
Schedule and/or the applicable switched access tariffs.
6.1.8.1 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T
CONNECTICUT on a wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users, all Wholesale
Local Switching Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, and IntraLATA Toll Traffic originated by
CLEC’s End Users are subject to intercarrier compensation as addressed in Section
6.2.8.3 below.
6.1.9 To the extent that the Parties are not currently exchanging traffic in a given LATA or local calling
area, the Parties’ obligation to pay intercarrier compensation to each other shall commence on the
date the Parties agree that the Interconnection is complete (i.e., each Party has established its
originating trunks as well as all ancillary traffic trunking such as Operator Services, 911 or Mass
Calling trunks) and is capable of fully supporting originating and terminating End User traffic. In
addition, the Parties agree that test traffic is not subject to compensation pursuant to this
Attachment.
6.1.10 The Parties acknowledge that Section 6.0 above addresses the method of compensation for traffic
properly exchanged by the Parties under this Agreement.
6.2 Reciprocal Compensation for Termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic:
6.2.1 Section 251(b)(5) Traffic shall mean Telecommunications traffic exchanged over the Parties’ own
facilities in which the originating End User of one Party and the terminating End User of the other
Party are:
6.2.1.1 both physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC
Local (or “General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or
regulatory agency; or both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange
Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This includes but
is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local
Calling Service (ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
6.2.2 AT&T-21STATE made an offer (the “Offer”) to all Telecommunications carriers to exchange
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FCC’s
interim ISP terminating compensation plan of the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order,
In the Matter of Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act
of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-
68 (rel. April 27, 2001) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”) which was remanded but not vacated in
WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 01-1218 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
6.2.3 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC agree to carry out the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation
plan on the date designated by AT&T-21STATE in a particular state without waiving, and expressly
reserving, all appellate rights to contest FCC, judicial, legislative, or other regulatory rulings

regarding ISP-Bound traffic, including but not limited to, appeals of the FCC’s ISP Compensation
Order. By agreeing to this Attachment, both Parties reserve the right to advocate their respective
positions before courts, state or federal commissions, or legislative bodies.
6.2.3.1 Should a regulatory agency, court or legislature change or nullify the AT&T-21STATE’s
designated date to begin billing under the FCC’s ISP terminating compensation plan,
then the Parties also agree that any necessary billing true-ups, reimbursements, or
other accounting adjustments shall be made symmetrically and to the same date that
the FCC terminating compensation plan was deemed applicable to all traffic in that state
exchanged under Section 251(b)(5) of the Act. By way of interpretation, and without
limiting the application of the foregoing, the Parties intend for retroactive compensation
adjustments, to the extent they are ordered by intervening law, to apply uniformly to all
traffic among AT&T-21STATE, CLEC and CMRS carriers in the state where traffic is
exchanged as local calls within the meaning of this Attachment.
6.2.4 In AT&T-21STATE the rates, terms and conditions for compensation of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic,
as defined in Section 6.2.1 above, are set forth in this Section 6.2 and ISP-Bound Traffic, as
defined in Section 6.3.1 below will be compensated at the FCC’s interim ISP terminating
compensation rate as set forth in Section 6.3.4.2 below in a specific state on the Effective Date of
this Agreement.
6.2.4.1 Until and unless AT&T CONNECTICUT chooses to offer to exchange Section 251(b)(5)
Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic on and after a designated date pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan, the compensation
set forth in this Section 6.2 will apply to all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound
Traffic for Connecticut. The Parties will also agree that any billing true-ups,
reimbursements, or other accounting adjustments on past traffic shall be made uniformly
and on the same date as for all traffic exchanged under Section 251(b)(5) of the Act. By
way of interpretation, and without limiting the application of the foregoing, the Parties
intend for retroactive compensation adjustments to apply to all traffic among AT&T
CONNECTICUT, CLEC, and CMRS carriers in Connecticut where traffic is exchanged
as local calls within the meaning of this Attachment.
6.2.5 In instances where the originating carrier is originating Telecommunications traffic over its own
facilities (i.e., not leased or purchased from AT&T-22STATE) the following Tandem serving rate
elements are applicable on a terminating MOU basis and include compensation for the following
sub-elements if such network functions are actually provided by the terminating Party for the
termination of the originating Party’s traffic:
6.2.5.1 Tandem Switching – compensation for the use of Tandem Switching consists of a call
set-up rate element (per message) where applicable, and a duration (per minute) rate
element.
6.2.5.2 Common (Tandem) Transport – compensation for the transmission facilities (1) between
the Tandem Switch and the End Offices subtending that Tandem, (2) between Tandem
Switches, and/or (3) between host and remote End Office Switches consists of a
transport termination (per minute) rate element and a transport facility mileage (per
minute, per mile) rate element.

6.2.5.3 End Office Switching in a Tandem Serving Arrangement – compensation for the local
End Office Switching and line termination necessary to complete the transmission in a
Tandem-Served Arrangement consists of a call set-up rate element (per message in
AT&T-13STATE) and a call duration (per minute) rate element.
6.2.6 In instances where the originating carrier is originating Telecommunications traffic over its own
facilities (i.e., not leased or purchased from AT&T-22STATE), the following End Office switching
rate elements are applicable on a terminating MOU basis:
6.2.6.1 End Office switching – compensation for the local End Office switching and line
termination necessary to complete the transmission in an End Office serving
arrangement. It consists of a call set-up rate element (per message in AT&T-13STATE)
where applicable, and a call duration (per minute) rate element.
6.2.7 CLEC shall only be paid End Office Switching rate element(s).
6.2.8 Intercarrier Compensation for Wholesale Local Switching Traffic for AT&T-13STATE:
6.2.8.1 Where CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE pursuant to the terms of
a Section 271 Agreement (herein after referred to as “switching on a wholesale basis”),
CLEC will deal directly with Third Party carriers for purposes of reciprocal compensation
for calls originated by or terminated to the End Users served by such arrangements.
AT&T-12STATE is required to provide CLEC with timely, complete and correct
information to enable CLEC to meet the requirements of this Section.
6.2.8.2 The following reciprocal compensation terms shall apply to all traffic exchanged
between AT&T-12STATE and CLEC when CLEC purchases local switching from
AT&T-12STATE on a wholesale basis:
6.2.8.2.1 For intra-switch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between
AT&T-12STATE and CLEC, the Parties agree to impose no call termination
charges pertaining to reciprocal compensation on each other.
6.2.8.2.2 For interswitch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between
AT&T-12STATE and CLEC where CLEC’s End User originates a call that
is terminated to an AT&T-12STATE End User, such traffic shall be paid for
reciprocally at the End Office Switching rate applicable for 251(b)(5) Traffic
set forth in the Pricing Schedule and as specified in Section 6.2.5 above or
the FCC Plan rate applicable for ISP-Bound Traffic set forth in Section
6.3.4.2 below as determined by the rebuttable presumption as described in
Section 6.3.5.
6.2.8.3 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T
CONNECTICUT on a wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users, AT&T
CONNECTICUT will be solely responsible for compensating the terminating Third Party
carrier (where appropriate) for any traffic that originates from CLEC’s End Users. When
CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a wholesale basis,
CLEC can not seek intercarrier compensation from AT&T CONNECTICUT for any traffic
that originates from either an AT&T CONNECTICUT End User or a Third Party carrier’s
End User.

6.2.9.1 Compensation for MTA shall be at the applicable Tandem Switching and transport
charges specified in the Pricing Schedule and shall be billed in addition to any call
transport and termination charges.
6.2.9.2 To the extent CLEC routes its traffic in such a way that utilizes AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE’s MTA service without properly ordering MTA, CLEC shall pay AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE the associated MTA charges.
6.3 Rates, Terms and Conditions of FCC’s Interim ISP Terminating Compensation Plan:
6.3.1 In accordance with the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order, In the Matter of
Implementation of the Local Compensation Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel.
April 27, 2001) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”), “ISP-Bound Traffic” shall mean
Telecommunications traffic exchanged between CLEC and AT&T-22STATE over each Party’s own
facilities in which the originating End User of one Party and the ISP served by the other Party are:
6.3.1.1 both physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC’s
Local (or “General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state commission or
regulatory agency; or
6.3.1.2 both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within
the same common mandatory local calling area. This includes, but it is not limited to,
mandatory EAS, mandatory ELCS or other types of mandatory expanded local calling
scopes.
6.3.2 In states in which AT&T-22STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-
Bound Traffic pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the
FCC ISP Compensation Order, traffic is presumed to be ISP-Bound Traffic in accordance with the
rebuttable presumption set forth in Section 6.3.5 below of this Attachment.
6.3.3 The rates, terms and conditions set forth in Section 6.3 above shall apply to the termination of all
ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between the Parties in each of the applicable state(s) for which
AT&T-22STATE has made an offer as described in Section 6.2 above effective on the Effective
Date of this Agreement. All ISP-Bound Traffic is subject to the rebuttable presumption.
6.3.4 Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic:
6.3.4.1 The rates, terms, and conditions in Section 6.3 above apply only to the termination of all
ISP-Bound Traffic as defined in Section 6.3.1 above and are subject to the rebuttable
presumption.
6.3.4.2 The Parties agree to compensate each other for the transport and termination of all ISP-
Bound Traffic on a MOU basis per the Pricing Schedule.
6.3.4.3 Payment of Intercarrier Compensation on ISP-Bound Traffic will not vary according to
whether the traffic is routed through a Tandem Switch or directly to an End Office
switch.

6.3.5 ISP-Bound Traffic Rebuttable Presumption
6.3.5.1 In accordance with Paragraph 79 of the FCC’s ISP Compensation Order, the Parties
agree that there is a rebuttable presumption that any of the combined Section 251(b)(5)
Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and, in AT&T-12STATE, Wholesale Local Switching Traffic
exchanged between the Parties exceeding a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio is, for
purposes of Intercarrier Compensation, presumed to be ISP-Bound Traffic subject to the
compensation terms in this Section 6.3.5 above. Either Party has the right to rebut the
3:1 ISP-Bound Traffic presumption by identifying the actual ISP-Bound Traffic by any
means agreed by the Parties, or by any method approved by the Commission. If a
Party seeking to rebut the presumption takes appropriate action at the Commission
pursuant to Section 252 of the Act and the Commission agrees that such Party has
rebutted the presumption, the methodology and/or means approved by the Commission
for use in determining the ratio shall be utilized by the Parties as of the date of the
Commission approval and, in addition, shall be utilized to determine the appropriate
true-up as described below. During the pendency of any such proceedings to rebut the
presumption, the Parties will remain obligated to pay the reciprocal compensation rates
set forth in Section 6.2 above for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, and the rates set forth in
Section 6.3.4.2 above for ISP-Bound Traffic. ISP-Bound Traffic is subject to a true-up
upon the conclusion of such proceedings. Such true-up shall be retroactive back to the
date a Party first sought appropriate relief from the Commission.
6.3.6 For purposes of this Section 6.3.6, all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, all ISP-Bound Traffic and all
Wholesale Local Switching Traffic shall be referred to as “Billable Traffic” and will be billed in
accordance with Section 6.12 below.
6.3.6.1 For combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic (excluding traffic originated by carriers
purchasing a local switching product from AT&T) and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged
between the Parties which does not exceed a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio as set
forth Section 6.3.5 above, such traffic shall be defined as “In-Balance” traffic. Each
Party will invoice the other party on a monthly basis for such “In-Balance” traffic at the
reciprocal compensation rates set forth in Section 6.2 above for Section 251(b)(5)
Traffic.
6.3.6.2 For combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic (excluding traffic originated by carriers
purchasing a local switching product from AT&T) and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged
between the Parties exceeding a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio as set forth in
Section 6.3.5 above, such traffic shall be defined as “Out-of-Balance” traffic. The
Carrier whose traffic is “Out-of-Balance” will, on a monthly basis, calculate the amount of
traffic that will be invoiced as follows: (1) for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, the rates shall be
based on the reciprocal compensation rate elements set forth in Section 6.2.5 above
and the Pricing Schedule; (2) for ISP-Bound Traffic, the rates shall be the FCC’s interim
ISP terminating compensation rates set forth in Section 6.3.4.2 above.
6.4 Other Telecommunications Traffic:
6.4.1 Except as set forth in Section 6.3 above, the terms of this Attachment are not applicable to (i)
interstate or intrastate Exchange Access traffic, (ii) Information Access traffic, or (iii) any other type

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
of traffic found to be exempt from reciprocal compensation by the FCC or the Commission, with the
exception of ISP-Bound Traffic which is addressed in this Attachment. All Exchange Access traffic
and IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the
applicable federal and state tariffs.
6.4.2 FX services are retail service offerings purchased by FX End Users which allow such FX End
Users to obtain exchange service from a mandatory local calling area other than the mandatory
local calling area where the FX customer is physically located, but within the same LATA as the
number that is assigned. FX service enables particular End Users to avoid what might otherwise
be toll calls between the FX End User’s physical location and End Users in the foreign exchange.
FX Telephone Numbers are those telephone numbers with rating and routing points that are
different from those of the geographic area in which the End User is physically located. FX
Telephone Numbers that deliver second dial tone with the ability for the calling party to enter
access codes and an additional recipient telephone number remain classified as FGA calls, and
are subject to the originating and terminating carriers’ tariffed Switched Exchange Access rates
(also known as “Meet Point Billed” compensation). There are two types of FX service:
6.4.2.1 “Dedicated FX Traffic” shall mean those calls routed by means of a physical, dedicated
circuit delivering dial tone or otherwise serving an End User’s station from a serving
Central Office (also known as End Office) located outside of that station’s mandatory
local calling area. Dedicated FX Service permits the End User physically located in one
exchange to be assigned telephone numbers resident in the serving Central (or End)
Office in another “foreign” exchange, thereby creating a local presence in that “foreign”
exchange.
6.4.2.2 “Virtual Foreign Exchange (FX) Traffic” and “FX-type Traffic” shall refer to those calls
delivered to telephone numbers that are rated as local to the other telephone numbers
in a given mandatory local calling area, but where the recipient End User’s station
assigned that telephone number is physically located outside of that mandatory local
calling area. Virtual FX Service also permits an End User physically located in one
exchange to be assigned telephone numbers resident in the serving Central (or End)
Office in another, “foreign,” exchange, thereby creating a local presence in the “foreign”
exchange. Virtual FX Service differs from Dedicated FX Service, however, in that
Virtual FX End Users continue to draw dial tone or are otherwise served from a Central
(or End) Office which may provide service across more than one Commission-
prescribed mandatory local calling area, whereas Dedicated FX Service End Users draw
dial tone or are otherwise served from a Central (or End) Office located outside their
mandatory calling area.
6.4.2.3 FX Traffic is not Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and instead the transport and termination
compensation for FX Traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement in AT&T-
21STATE.
6.4.2.3.1 To the extent that ISP-Bound Traffic is provisioned via an FX-type
arrangement, such traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement. “Bill
and Keep” refers to an arrangement in which neither of two interconnecting
parties charges the other for terminating FX traffic that originates on the
other Party’s network.

6.4.2.4 Pursuant to the Connecticut Commission decision in Docket No. 01-01-29RE01, the
originating Party will bill the terminating Party the appropriate originating access charges
for all traffic except ISP-Bound Traffic that is terminated to a number that is provisioned
as a Virtual FX, Dedicated FX or FX-type service as defined in Section 6.4.2 above in
AT&T CONNECTICUT. In such circumstances, for ISP-Bound Traffic the appropriate
compensation mechanism is bill and keep.
6.4.2.5 Segregating and Tracking FX Traffic:
6.4.2.5.1 For AT&T-12STATE, the terminating carrier is responsible for separately
identifying IntraLATA Virtual FX, Dedicated FX, and FX-type traffic from
other types of Intercarrier traffic for compensation purposes. The
terminating carrier will be responsible for providing the originating carrier
with an FX usage summary which includes a ten (10) digit telephone
number level detail of the MOUs terminated to FX Telephone Numbers on
its network each month (or in each applicable billing period, if not billed
monthly), or by any means mutually agreed by the Parties.
6.4.2.5.2 Terminating carrier will not assess compensation charges to the Voice FX
MOU and ISP FX MOU in AT&T-21STATE.
6.4.2.5.3 AT&T CONNECTICUT, FX traffic must be identified as voice FX and ISP
FX. AT&T CONNECTICUT will work with CLEC in reviewing its data to
determine the volume of IntraLATA FX traffic being exchanged for an
agreed-upon period of time. Once the data review is completed, the Parties
will estimate the percentage of MOUs that is attributable to FX traffic and
assign percentage factors. For AT&T CONNECTICUT ISP FX percentage
will be assigned (“PIFX”) and voice FX percentage will be assigned
(“PVFX”). The PIFX and PVFX (“FX factor”) will be used in lieu of providing
the actual MOUs data. This plan will be applied on an individual CLEC
basis.
6.4.2.5.3.1 The FX factor will be applied to the measured local usage
MOUs and result in the following billing adjustments:
6.4.2.5.3.1.1 Terminating carrier will subtract both the
voice FX MOU and ISP FX MOU from the
measured local MOU prior to assessing
terminating compensation charges.
6.4.2.5.3.1.2 Originating carrier will apply the
appropriate originating access charges
only to the Voice FX MOU in AT&T
CONNECTICUT.
6.4.2.5.4 In AT&T-13STATE either Party may request an audit of the FX Usage
Summary or the FX Factor on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Day’s
written Notice and any audit shall be accomplished during normal business
hours at the office of the Party being audited. Such audit must be
performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid for by the Party requesting
the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the Parties shall use

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
one of the following independent auditors: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst
& Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Big-4 Auditors). Selection
of the Big-4 Auditor shall be made by the Party requesting the audit and the
selected Big-4 Auditor must be independent as determined by current
accounting and auditing standards promulgated by the appropriate
accounting governing body. Such audits shall be requested within six (6)
months of having received the FX Usage Summary or the FX Factor and
associated usage from the other Party and may not be requested more
than twice per year, once per calendar year, unless the audit finds there
has been a five percent (5%) or higher net error or variance in calculations,
in which case a subsequent audit is required. Based upon the audit,
previous compensation, billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for the
past six (6) months.
6.4.2.5.4.1 If the FX factor is adjusted based upon the audit results,
the adjusted FX factor will apply for the six (6) month
period following the completion of the audit. If, as a result
of the audit, either Party has overstated the FX factor or
underreported the FX Usage by five percent (5%) or more,
that Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for the cost of
the audit and will pay for the cost of a subsequent audit
which is to happen within nine (9) months of the initial
audit.
6.4.3 Private Line Services include private line-like and special access services and are not subject to
intercarrier compensation. Private Line Services are defined as a digital point-to-point connection
that provides a dedicated circuit of pre-subscribed bandwidth between any two (2) points. Private
Line Services are used to consolidate communications over one (1) line for voice, data, video and
multimedia.
6.4.4 The Parties recognize and agree that ISP and Internet traffic (excluding ISP-Bound Traffic as
defined in Section 6.3.1 above) could also be exchanged outside of the applicable local calling
scope, or routed in ways that could make the rates and rate structure in Section 6.2 above and
Section 6.3 above not apply, including but not limited to ISP calls that meet the definitions of:

6.5 Optional Calling Area Traffic – AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS:
6.5.1 Compensation for Optional Calling Area (OCA) Traffic, (also known as Optional Extended Area
Service and Optional EAS) is for the termination of intercompany traffic to and from the
Commission approved one-way or two-way optional exchanges(s) and the associated metropolitan
area except mandatory extended traffic as addressed in Section 6.2.1 above and Section 6.3.1
above. The transport and termination rate applies when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS or
AT&T TEXAS transports traffic and terminates it at its own switch.
6.5.2 In the context of this Attachment, Optional Calling Areas (OCAs) exist only in the States of
Arkansas, Kansas and Texas, and are outlined in the applicable state Local Exchange tariffs. This
rate is independent of any retail service arrangement established by either Party. CLEC and AT&T
ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS are not precluded from establishing their own
local calling areas or prices for purposes of retail telephone service; however the terminating rates
to be used for any such offering will still be administered as described in this Attachment.
6.5.3 The state specific OCA Transport and Termination rates are identified in the Pricing Schedule.
6.6 MCA Traffic - AT&T MISSOURI:
6.6.1 For compensation purposes in the State of Missouri, Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound
Traffic shall be further defined as MCA Traffic and Non-MCA Traffic. MCA Traffic is traffic
originated by a party providing a local calling scope plan pursuant to the Missouri Public Service
Commission Orders in Case No. TO-92-306 and Case No. TO-99-483 (MCA Orders) and the call
is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic based on the calling scope of the originating party pursuant to the MCA
Orders. Non-MCA Traffic is all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that is not defined
as MCA Traffic.
6.6.1.1 Either party providing Metropolitan Calling Area (MCA) service shall offer the full calling
scope prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306, without regard to the identity of the called
Party’s local service provider. The Parties may offer additional toll-free outbound calling
or other services in conjunction with MCA service, but in any such offering the Party
shall not identify any calling scope other than that prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306 as
“MCA” service.
6.6.1.2 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483,
MCA Traffic shall be exchanged on a Bill and Keep intercompany compensation basis
meaning that the Party originating a call defined as MCA Traffic shall not compensate
the terminating Party for terminating the call.
6.6.2 The Parties agree to use the LERG to provision the appropriate MCA NXXs in their networks. The
LERG should be updated at least forty-five (45) calendar days in advance of opening a new code
to allow the other Party the ability to make the necessary network modifications. If the Commission
orders the Parties to use an alternative other than the LERG, the Parties will comply with the
Commission’s final order.
6.6.3 If CLEC provides service via Resale or in conjunction with ported numbers in the MCA, the
appropriate MCA NXXs will be updated by AT&T MISSOURI.

6.7 Primary Toll Carrier Arrangements:
6.7.1 A Primary Toll Carrier (PTC) is a company that provides IntraLATA Toll Traffic Service for its own
End User customers and potentially for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers. In this ILEC
arrangement, the PTC would receive the ILEC End User IntraLATA toll traffic revenues and pay the
ILEC for originating these toll calls. The PTC would also pay the terminating switched access
charges on behalf of the ILEC. In AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T
LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH
CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE wherein Primary Toll Carrier arrangements are mandated,
and AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T
MISSISSIPPI, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T
TENNESSEE is functioning as the PTC for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, the following
provisions apply to the IntraLATA toll traffic which is subject to the PTC arrangement:
6.7.1.1 AT&T INDIANA, AT&T NEVADA, and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA, shall deliver such
IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from that Third Party ILEC and terminated to CLEC
as the terminating carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC
arrangement mandated by the respective state Commission. Where AT&T INDIANA,
AT&T NEVADA, and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA is functioning as the PTC for Third Party
ILEC’s End User customers, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T NEVADA, and/or AT&T
OKLAHOMA shall pay CLEC on behalf of the originating Third Party ILEC for the
termination of such IntraLATA toll traffic at the terminating switched access rates as set
forth in CLEC’s intrastate access service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed
the compensation contained in the AT&T-22STATE intrastate access service tariff in the
respective State.
6.7.1.2 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T
SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic
that originated from that Third Party ILEC and terminated to CLEC as the terminating
carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated
by the respective state Commission. Where AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY,
AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T
TENNESSEE is functioning as the PTC for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers,
the following provisions apply to the minutes of use terminating to CLEC. AT&T
GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T
SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE and CLEC will work cooperatively to
develop a percentage of the amount of state specific PTC ILEC originated intraLATA toll
minutes of use that are within the state specific total ILEC originated minutes of use
reflected in the monthly EMI 11-01-01 Records provided to CLEC by AT&T GEORGIA,
AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T SOUTH
CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE. CLEC will apply this state specific percentage
against the state specific total ILEC originated EMI 11-01-01 minutes of use each month
to determine the amount of PTC intraLATA toll minutes of use for which AT&T
GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T
SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC. Such
percentage will be updated no more than twice each year. AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T
KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA,
and/or AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC for this PTC traffic as it would for

AT&T-22STATE.
6.7.1.3 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T
MISSISSIPPI, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from CLEC
and terminated to the Third Party ILEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state
Commission. CLEC shall pay AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KENTUCKY,
AT&T LOUISIANA, AT&T MISSISSIPPI, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
SOUTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TENNESSEE for the use of its facilities at the rates
set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s intrastate access service tariff in the respective state.
CLEC shall pay the ILEC directly for the termination of such traffic originated from
CLEC.
6.8 IntraLATA 800 Traffic:
6.8.1 The Parties shall provide to each other IntraLATA 800 Access Detail Usage Data for Customer
billing and IntraLATA 800 Copy Detail Usage Data for access billing in Exchange Message
Interface (EMI) format. On a monthly basis, at a minimum, the Parties agree to provide this data to
each other at no charge. In the event of errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in data received from
either Party, the liability of the Party providing such data shall be limited to the provision of
corrected data only. If the originating Party does not send an End User billable Record to the
terminating Party, the originating Party will not bill the terminating Party any interconnection
charges for this traffic.
6.8.2 IntraLATA 800 Traffic calls are billed to and paid for by the called or terminating Party, regardless
of which Party performs the 800 query. For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9 STATE, each Party
shall pay the other the appropriate switched access charges set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate switched access tariffs. CLEC will pay AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE the database query charge as set forth in the AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access services Tariff as filed and in effect
with the FCC or appropriate Commission as applicable. Where technically feasible, each Party will
provide to the other Party the appropriate Records, in accordance with industry standards,
necessary for billing intraLATA 8YY customers. The Records provided will be in a standard EMI
format. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE provision of 8YY Toll Free Dialing (TFD) to CLEC
requires interconnection from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE‘s 8YY Signal
Channel Point (SCP). Such interconnections shall be established pursuant to AT&T-22STATE’s
Common Channel Signaling Interconnection Guidelines and Telcordia’s CCS Network Interface
Specification document, TR-TSV-000905. CLEC shall establish SS7 interconnection at the AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Local Signal Transfer Points serving the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE 8YY SCPs that CLEC desires to query. The terms and conditions for 8YY TFD
are set out in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff.
6.9 Meet-Point Billing (MPB) and IXC Switched Access Traffic Compensation:
6.9.1 Intercarrier compensation for Switched Access Traffic shall be on a MPB basis as described below.
6.9.2 The Parties will establish MPB arrangements in order to jointly provide Switched Access Services
via the respective carrier’s Tandem Office Switch in accordance with the MPB guidelines contained

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 12/22/08
in the OBF’s Multiple Exchange Carriers Ordering and Design (MECOD) and Multiple Exchange
Carrier Access Billing (MECAB) documents, as amended from time to time.
6.9.3 Billing for the Switched Exchange Access Services jointly provided by the Parties via MPB
arrangements shall be according to the Multiple Bill/Single Tariff method. As described in the
MECAB document, each Party will render a bill in accordance with its own tariff for that portion of
the service it provides. Each Party will bill its own network access service rates. The Residual
Interconnection Charge (RIC), if any, will be billed by the Party providing the End Office function.
6.9.4 The Parties will maintain provisions in their respective federal and state access tariffs, or provisions
within the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any successor tariff,
sufficient to reflect this MPB arrangement, including MPB percentages.
6.9.5 As detailed in the MECAB document, the Parties will exchange all information necessary to
accurately, reliably and promptly bill third parties for Switched Access Services traffic jointly
handled by the Parties via the MPB arrangement, when the Parties do not have all detailed
Recordings for billing.
6.9.5.1 The Parties agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will bill IXCs for
originating and terminating access charges from AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE Recordings when AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has direct
connections with IXCs via AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s access tandem.
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will pass EMI Records to CLEC when AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is the Official Recording Company. The Parties also
agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and CLEC will exchange EMI
records when each are acting as the official Recording Company and CLEC is the
access tandem company with direct connections with IXCs.
6.9.5.2 The Parties also agree that AT&T-13STATE and CLEC will exchange EMI Records
when each is acting as the Official Recording Company. As described in the MECAB
document, the Official Recording Company for Tandem routed traffic is: (1) the End
Office company for originating traffic, (2) the Tandem company for terminating traffic and
(3) the SSP company for originating 800 traffic.
6.9.6 Information shall be passed or exchanged in a mutually acceptable electronic file transfer protocol.
Where the EMI Records cannot be transferred due to a transmission failure, Records can be
provided via a mutually acceptable medium. The provision of Access Usage Records (AURs) to
accommodate MPB will be on a reciprocal, no charge basis. Each Party agrees to provide the
other Party with AURs based upon mutually agreed upon intervals.
6.9.7 MPB shall also apply to all jointly provided Switched Access MOU traffic bearing the 900, or toll
free NPAs (e.g., 800, 877, 866, 888 NPAs, or any other non-geographic NPAs).
6.9.7.1 For AT&T-13STATE, the Party that performs the SSP function (launches the query to
the 800 database) will bill the 800 Service Provider for this function.
6.9.7.2 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, CLEC will pay the database query charge
set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access
services Tariff.
6.9.8 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC agree to provide the other Party with notification of any discovered
errors in the record exchange process within ten (10) Business Days of the discovery.

6.9.9 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty
(60) calendar days of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a
reasonable estimate of the lost data, based upon no less than three (3) and no more than twelve
(12) consecutive months of prior usage data.
6.10 Compensation for Origination and Termination of InterLATA Traffic:
6.10.1 Where a CLEC originates or terminates its own End User InterLATA Traffic not subject to MPB, the
CLEC must purchase feature group access service from AT&T-22STATE’s state or federal access
tariffs, whichever is applicable, to carry such InterLATA Traffic.
6.11 IntraLATA Toll Traffic Compensation:
6.11.1 For intrastate IntraLATA Message Telephone Service (MTS) toll traffic, compensation for
termination of such traffic will be at terminating access rates. For intrastate IntraLATA 800 Service,
compensation for termination of such traffic will be at originating access rates, including the Carrier
Common Line (CCL) charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set forth in each
Party’s intrastate access service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation
contained in AT&T-22STATE’s tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.11.2 For interstate IntraLATA MTS toll traffic, compensation for termination of such traffic will be at
terminating access rates. For interstate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for termination of
such traffic will be originating access rates, including the CCL charge where applicable. The
appropriate access rates are set forth in each Party’s interstate access service tariff, but such
compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in the AT&T-22STATE’s tariff in
whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.12 Billing Arrangements for Termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic
and IntraLATA Toll Traffic:
6.12.1 In AT&T-22STATE, each Party, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, will calculate
terminating Interconnection MOUs based on standard switch Recordings made within terminating
carrier’s network for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, IntraLATA
Toll Traffic, and in AT&T-13STATE, Wholesale Local Switching Traffic. These Recordings are the
basis for each Party to generate bills to the other Party.
6.12.1.1 Where CLEC is using terminating Recordings to bill intercarrier compensation, AT&T-
12STATE will provide the terminating Records where available by means of the Daily
Usage File (DUF) to identify traffic that originates from an End User being served by a
Third Party telecommunications carrier using an AT&T-12STATE non-resale offering
whereby AT&T-12STATE provides the End Office switching on a wholesale basis.
Such Records will contain the Operating Company Number (OCN) of the responsible
LEC that originated the calls which CLEC may use to bill such originating carrier for
MOUs terminated on CLEC’s network.
6.12.2 For those usage based charges where actual charge information is not determinable by AT&T
WEST REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the traffic is
unidentifiable, the Parties will jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to
determine the appropriate charges. PLU is calculated by dividing the Local MOU delivered to a
Party for termination by the total MOU delivered to a Party for termination.

6.12.2.1 CLEC and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE agree to exchange such reports and/or data
as provided in this Attachment to facilitate the proper billing of traffic. Either Party may
request an audit of such usage reports on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Days
written Notice and any audit shall be accomplished during normal business hours at the
office of the Party being audited. Such audit must be performed by a mutually agreed-to
auditor paid for by the Party requesting the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be
reached within one (1) month of the date of the written request for an audit, the Parties
shall use one (1) of the following independent auditors: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst
& Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Big-4 Auditors). Selection of the Big-4
Auditor shall be made by the Party requesting the audit and the selected Big-4 Auditor
must be independent as determined by current accounting and auditing standards
promulgated by the appropriate accounting governing body. Such audit shall be
requested within six (6) months of having received the usage reports from the other
Party and may not be requested more than twice per year, once per calendar year for
each call detail type unless the audit finds there has been a five percent (5%) or higher
net error or variance in calculations. Based upon the audit, previous compensation,
billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for the past six (6) months. If, as a result of
the audit, either Party has overstated the PLU or underreported the call detail usage by
five percent (5%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for the cost of
the audit.
6.12.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Jurisdictional Reporting Process:
6.12.3.1 Each Party shall report to the other the projected PIU factors, including but not limited to
PIU associated with facilities (PIUE) and Terminating PIU (TPIU) factors. The
application of the PIU will determine the respective interstate traffic percentages to be
billed at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s FCC No. 1 Tariff rates. All
jurisdictional report requirements, rules and regulations for IXCs specified in AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s interstate and/or intrastate access services tariff(s)
will apply to CLEC. After interstate and intrastate traffic percentages have been
determined by use of PIU procedures, the PLU and PLF factors will be used for
application and billing of local traffic and facilities. The intrastate toll traffic shall be billed
at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff rates.
Each Party shall update its PIUs on the first of January, April, July and October of each
year and shall send it to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar
days after the first of each such month to be effective the first bill period the following
month, respectively, for all services showing the percentages of use for the past three
(3) months ending the last day of December, March, June and September. Additional
requirements associated with PIU calculations and reporting shall be as set forth in
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.12.3.2 Each Party shall report to the other a PLU factor. The application of the PLU will
determine the amount of local or ISP-Bound minutes to be billed to the other Party.
Each Party shall update its PLU on the first of January, April, July and October of each
year and shall send it to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar
days after the first of each such month to be effective the first bill period the following
month, respectively, based on local and ISP-Bound usage for the past three (3) months
ending the last day of December, March, June and September, respectively.

Requirements associated with PLU calculation and reporting shall be as set forth in
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.12.3.3 Each Party shall report to the other a PLF factor. The application of the PLF will
determine the portion of switched dedicated transport to be billed per the local
jurisdiction rates. The PLF shall be applied to multiplexing, local channel and interoffice
channel switched dedicated transport utilized in the provision of Local Interconnection
Trunks. Each Party shall update its PLF on the first of January, April, July and October
of the year and shall send it to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the first of each such month to be effective the first bill period the
following month, respectively. Requirements associated with PLF calculation and
reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional
Factors Reporting Guide.
6.12.3.4 Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 6.12.3.1 above, Section 6.12.3.2 above and
Section 6.12.3.3 above where AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has message
Recording technology that identifies the jurisdiction of traffic terminated to AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, such information shall, at AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE’s option, be utilized to determine the appropriate jurisdictional
reporting factors (i.e., PLU, PIU, and/or PLF), in lieu of those provided by CLEC. In the
event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE opts to utilize its own data to
determine jurisdictional reporting factors, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE shall
notify CLEC at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the beginning of the calendar
quarter in which AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will begin to utilize its own
data.
6.12.3.5 On thirty (30) calendar days written Notice, CLEC must provide AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE the ability and opportunity to conduct an annual audit to ensure the
proper billing of traffic. CLEC shall retain Records of call detail for a minimum of nine
(9) months from which the PLU, PLF and/or PIU can be ascertained. The audit shall be
conducted during normal business hours at an office designated by CLEC. Audit
requests shall not be submitted more frequently than one (1) time per calendar year.
Audits shall be performed by an independent auditor chosen by AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE. The audited factor (PLF, PLU and/or PIU) shall be adjusted based
upon the audit results and shall apply to the usage for the audited period through the
time period when the audit is completed, to the usage for the quarter prior to the audit
period, and to the usage for the two (2) quarters following the completion of the audit. If,
as a result of an audit, CLEC is found to have overstated the PLF, PLU and/or PIU by
five percentage points (5%) or more, CLEC shall reimburse AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE for the cost of the audit.
6.12.4 In states in which AT&T-22STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-
Bound Traffic pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the
FCC ISP Compensation Order, ISP-Bound Traffic will be calculated using the 3:1 Presumption as
set forth in Section 6.3.5 above of this Attachment.
6.12.5 The measurement of MOUs over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be in actual
conversation seconds. The total conversation seconds over each individual Local Interconnection
Trunk Group will be totaled for the entire monthly bill and then rounded to the next whole minute.

6.12.6 All ISP-Bound Traffic for a given usage month shall be due and owing at the same time as
payments for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic under this Attachment. The Parties agree that all terms and
conditions regarding disputed MOUs, nonpayment, partial payment, late payment, interest on
outstanding balances, or other billing and payment terms shall apply to ISP-Bound Traffic the same
as for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic under this Attachment.
6.12.7 For billing disputes arising from Intercarrier Compensation charges, the Party challenging the
disputed amounts (the “Non-Paying Party”) may withhold payment for the amounts in dispute (the
“Disputed Amounts”) from the Party rendering the bill (the “Billing Party”) only for so long as the
dispute remains pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and
Conditions. Late payment charges and interest will continue to accrue on the Disputed Amounts
while the dispute remains pending. The Non-Paying Party need not pay late payment charges or
interest on the Disputed Amounts for so long as the dispute remains pending pursuant to the
dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and Conditions. Upon resolution of the
dispute pertaining to the Disputed Amounts in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of
the General Terms and Conditions: (1) the Non-Paying Party will remit the appropriate Disputed
Amounts to the Billing Party, together with all related interest and late payment charges, to the
Billing Party within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute, if (and to the extent) the
dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party; and/or (2) the Billing Party will render all appropriate
credits and adjustments to the Non-Paying Party for the Disputed Amounts, together with all
appropriate interest and late payment charges, within ten (10) business days of the resolution of
the dispute, if (and to the extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Non-Paying Party.
6.12.8 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty
(60) calendar days of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a
reasonable estimate of the lost data, based upon no less than three (3) and no more than twelve
(12) consecutive months of prior usage data.
6.13 Reservation of Rights and Specific Intervening Law Terms
6.13.1 In the event the pricing scheme in the FCC’s Interim ISP Compensation Order (defined in Section
6.3 above of this Attachment) is modified, eliminated or replaced, then the Parties agree to
negotiate an appropriate amendment to conform to such change in accordance with the
Intervening Law provisions of this Agreement and such new or changed provisions will apply on a
prospective basis, beginning with the effective date of the new order, unless a determination is

replacement, in which instance, the new or changed provisions will apply retroactively as set forth
in the new order. Either Party may begin billing the other Party according to the terms of the new
order, beginning sixty (60) calendar days after delivering a request to negotiate the change. True-
up of any retroactive application, for either the amendment negotiation period and/or for the
retroactive application period provided in the order, shall occur within one hundred and twenty
(120) calendar days of the effective date of the order, or be subject to dispute under the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
6.14 Switched Access Traffic
6.14.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates
from an End User physically located in one (1) local exchange and delivered for termination to an
End User physically located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing
a common mandatory local calling area as defined in AT&T-22STATE’s local exchange tariffs on

over a Party’s circuit switch, including traffic from a service that originates over a circuit switch and
uses Internet Protocol (IP) transport technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP
transport or multiple providers are involved in providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the
End User’s premises in IP format and is transmitted to the switch of a provider of voice
communication applications or services when such switch utilizes IP technology. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall be delivered to the
terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating Party’s access tariff(s) and
shall be subject to applicable intrastate and interstate switched access charges not to exceed
AT&T’s access tariff rates; provided, however, the following categories of Switched Access Traffic
are not subject to the above stated requirement relating to routing over feature group access
trunks:
6.14.1.1 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC End User that obtains local
dial tone from CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the
IntraLATA toll provider,
6.14.1.2 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an AT&T-22STATE End User that
obtains local dial tone from AT&T-22STATE where AT&T-22STATE is both the Section
251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the IntraLATA toll provider;
6.14.1.3 Switched Access Traffic delivered to AT&T-22STATE from an IXC where the
terminating number is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the LNP
query; and/or
6.14.1.4 Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a Third Party CLEC over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups destined to the other Party.
6.15 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies, and
arguments relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the Parties prior to
the Effective Date of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the Petition for Declaratory
Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from Access Charges, WC Docket No.
01-361(Released April 21, 2004).
6.15.1 In the limited circumstances in which a Third Party CLEC delivers Switched Access Traffic as
described in Section 6.14.1.4 above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, such
Party may deliver such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups. If it is determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups, and unless the traffic was delivered over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups
pursuant to an agreement filed with, and approved by, the Commission, the terminating Party may
object to the delivery of such traffic by providing written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to
the Notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and Conditions and request removal of such
traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with the goal of removing such
traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has not removed or is
unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 6.14.1.4 above from the
Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of Notice from the
other Party, the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the
applicable Commission to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such
interconnection trunks up to and including the right to block such traffic and to obtain
compensation, if appropriate, from the Third Party CLEC delivering such traffic to the extent it is not

sixty (60) calendar days, the Recording Company shall have no further obligation to recover the
data and shall have no further liability to the non-Recording Company.
7.4.4 If, despite timely notification by the non-Recording Company, message detail is lost and
unrecoverable as a direct result of the Recording Company having lost or damaged tapes or
incurred system outages while performing recording, Assembly and Editing, rating, Message
Processing, and/or transmission of message detail, both Parties will estimate the volume of lost
messages and associated revenue based on information available to it concerning the average
revenue per minute for the average interstate and/or intrastate call. In such events, the Recording
Company’s liability shall be limited to the granting of a credit adjusting amounts otherwise due from
it equal to the estimated net lost revenue associated with the lost message detail.
7.4.5 Each Party will not be liable for any costs incurred by the other Party when transmitting data files
via data lines and a transmission failure results in the non-receipt of data.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment 03 - Structure Access (here-on referred to as “Appendix”) sets forth the terms and conditions for
Right(s) of Way (ROW), Conduits and Poles provided by AT&T-22STATE and CLEC.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Anchor” means a device, structure, or assembly which stabilizes a Pole and holds it in place. An Anchor assembly
may consist of a rod and fixed object or plate, typically embedded in the ground, which is attached to a guy strand or
guy wire, which, in turn, is attached to the Pole. The term Anchor does not include the guy strand which connects the
Anchor to the Pole and includes only those Anchors which are owned by AT&T-22STATE, as distinguished from
Anchors which are owned and controlled by other persons or entities.
2.2 “Anchor/Guy Strand” means supporting wires, typically stranded together, or other devices attached to a Pole and
connecting that Pole to an Anchor or to another Pole for the purpose of increasing Pole stability. The term
Anchor/Guy Strand includes, but is not limited to, strands sometimes referred to as Anchor strands, down guys, guy
strands, and Pole-to-Pole guys.
2.3 “Application” means the process of requesting information related to records, Pole and/or Conduit availability, or
make-ready requirements for AT&T-22STATE-owned or controlled Facilities. Each Application is limited in size to a
maximum of 1) 100 consecutive Poles or 2) 10 consecutive Manhole sections or 5000 feet, whichever is greater. The
Application includes (but is not limited to) request for records, records investigation and/or a field investigation, and
Make-Ready Work.
2.4 “Assigned” when used with respect to Conduit or Duct space or Poles, means any space in such Conduit or Duct or
on such Pole that is occupied by a Telecommunications Service provider or a municipal or other governmental
authority. To ensure the judicious use of Poles and Conduits, space Assigned to a Telecommunications Service
provider must be physically occupied by the service provider, be it AT&T-22STATE or a new entrant, within twelve
(12) months of the space being Assigned.
2.5 “Attaching Party” means any Party wishing to make a physical Facility Attachment on or in any AT&T structure.
2.6 “Attachment” as used herein means the physical connection to AT&T-22STATE‘s ROW and all associated Structure
Access connectivity.
2.7 “Available” when used with respect to Conduit or Duct space or Poles, means any usable space in such Conduit or
Duct or on such Pole not assigned to a specific provider at the applicable time.
2.8 “Conduit” means a structure containing one or more Ducts, usually placed in the ground, in which cables or wires
may be installed.
2.9 “Conduit Occupancy” means the presence of wire, cable, optical conductors, or other Facilities within any portion of
AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System.
2.10 “Conduit System” means any combination of Ducts, Conduits, Manholes, and Handholes joined to form an integrated
whole. In this Appendix, the term refers to Conduit Systems owned or controlled by AT&T-22STATE.
2.11 “Cost” means the charges made by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC for specific work performed, and shall be (a) the actual
charges made by subcontractors to AT&T-22STATE for work and/or, (b) if the work was performed by AT&T-
22STATE employees, it shall be calculated on an individual case basis, based on the estimated amount of work to be
performed.
2.12 “Duct” means a single enclosed tube, pipe, or channel for enclosing and carrying cables, wires, and other Facilities.
As used in this Appendix, the term Duct includes Inner-Ducts created by subdividing a Duct into smaller channels.

2.13 “Facilities” refer to any property or equipment used in the provision of Telecommunications Services.
2.14 “Handholes” means an enclosure, usually below ground level, used for the purpose of installing, operating, and
maintaining facilities in a Conduit. A Handhole is too small to permit personnel to physically enter.
2.15 “Inner-Duct” means a pathway created by subdividing a Duct into smaller channels.
2.16 “Joint User” means a public utility (as a business organization, like an electric company, performing a public service
and subject to special governmental regulation) which has entered into an Agreement with AT&T-22STATE providing
reciprocal rights of attachment of Facilities owned by each Party to the Poles, Ducts, Conduits and ROW owned by
the other Party.
2.17 “Joint Use Pole” means a pole not owned by AT&T-22STATE, but upon which AT&T-22STATE maintains its
Facilities.
2.18 “Lashing” means an Attachment of a Sheath or Inner-Duct to a supporting strand.
2.19 “License” means any License issued pursuant to this Appendix and may, if the context requires, refer to Conduit
Occupancy or Pole Attachment Licenses issued by AT&T-22STATE.
2.20 “Make-Ready Work” means all work performed or to be performed to prepare AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit Systems,
Poles or Anchors and related Facilities for the requested occupancy or attachment of CLEC’s Facilities. Make-Ready
Work includes, but is not limited to, clearing obstructions (e.g., by rodding Ducts to ensure clear passage), the
rearrangement, transfer, replacement, and removal of existing Facilities on a Pole or in a Conduit System where such
work is required solely to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities and not to meet AT&T-22STATE’s business needs or
convenience. Make-Ready Work may require “dig ups” of existing Facilities and may include the repair, enlargement
or modification of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities (including, but not limited to, Conduits, Ducts, Handholes and
Manholes) or the performance of other work required to make a Pole, Anchor, Conduit or Duct usable for the initial
placement of CLEC’s Facilities.
2.21 “Manhole” means an enclosure, usually below ground level and entered through a hole on the surface covered with a
cast iron or concrete Manhole cover, which personnel may enter and use for the purpose of installing, operating, and
maintaining Facilities in a Conduit.
2.22 “Occupancy” means the physical presence of Telecommunication Facilities in a Duct, on a Pole, or within a ROW.
2.23 “Overlashing” involves an attacher tying communication conductors to existing, supportive strands of cable on poles,
which enables attachers to replace deteriorated cables or expand the capacity of existing facilities while reducing
construction disruption and associated expense.
2.24 “Pole” means both utility Poles and Anchors but only to those utility Poles and Anchors owned or controlled by AT&T-
22STATE, and does not include utility Poles or Anchors with respect to which AT&T-22STATE has no legal authority
to permit attachments by other persons or entities.
2.25 “Pole Attachment Act” and “Pole Attachment Act of 1978” means those provisions of the Act, as amended, now
codified as 47 U.S.C. § 224.
2.26 “Pre-License Survey” means all work and activities performed or to be performed to determine whether there is
adequate capacity on a Pole or in a Conduit or Conduit System (including Manholes and Handholes) to
accommodate CLEC’s Facilities and to determine what Make-Ready Work, if any, is required to prepare the Pole,
Conduit or Conduit System to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities.
2.27 “Right(s) of Way (ROW)” means the right to use the land or other property of another party to place Poles, Conduits,
cables, other structures and equipment, or to provide passage to access such structures and equipment. A ROW

include the right to use discrete space in buildings, building complexes, or other locations.
2.28 “Sheath” or “Sheathing” means an outer covering containing communications wires, fibers, or other communications
media.
2.29 “Spare Capacity” means any Poles, Conduit, Duct or Inner-Duct not currently assigned or subject to a pending
Application for Attachment/Occupancy. Spare Capacity does not include an Inner-Duct (not to exceed one Inner-
Duct per party) reserved by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC, or a Third Party for maintenance, repair, or emergency
restoration.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 Undertaking of AT&T-22STATE:
3.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC with equal and nondiscriminatory access to Pole space, Conduits,
Ducts, and ROW on terms and conditions equal to those provided by AT&T-22STATE to itself or to any
other Telecommunications Service provider. Further, AT&T-22STATE shall not withhold or delay
assignment of such Facilities to CLEC because of the potential or forecasted needs of itself or Third Parties.
3.2 Attachments and Occupancies Authorized by this Appendix:
3.2.1 AT&T-22STATE shall issue one or more Licenses to CLEC authorizing CLEC to attach Facilities to AT&T-
22STATE’s owned or controlled Poles and to place Facilities within AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled
Conduits, Ducts or ROW under the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix and the Act.
3.2.2 Unless otherwise provided herein, authority to attach Facilities to AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled
Poles, to place Facilities within AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Conduits, Ducts or ROW shall be
granted only in individual Licenses granted under this Appendix and the placement or use of such Facilities
shall be determined in accordance with such Licenses and procedures established in this Appendix.
3.2.3 CLEC agrees that its attachment of Facilities to AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Poles, occupancy of
AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Conduits, Ducts or ROW shall take place pursuant to the licensing
procedures set forth herein, and AT&T-22STATE agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
issuance of such Licenses.
3.2.4 CLEC may not sublease or otherwise authorize any Third Party to use any part of the AT&T-22STATE
Facilities licensed to CLEC under this Appendix, except that CLEC may lease its own Facilities to Third
Parties, or allow Affiliates to over lash cables to CLEC cables. Notwithstanding the above, upon Notice to
AT&T-22STATE, CLEC may permit Third Parties who have an Agreement with AT&T-22STATE to over
lash to existing CLEC attachments in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Third Party’s
Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
3.2.5 Attaching Party warrants that any overlashing the Attaching Party conducts or permits (via a third party or
contractor) shall meet the following requirements: (1) the overlashing complies with the NESC and any other
industry standards; (2) the Attaching Party has computed the pole loading with the additional overlashed
facility, and the pole will not be overloaded with the addition of the overlashed facility; (3) the Attaching Party
has determined that no make ready is necessary to accommodate the overlashed facility, or will insure that
any make-ready necessary will be conducted before the overlashing occurs. Attaching Party agrees to
indemnify AT&T-22STATE should any of the warranties be breached.
3.3 Licenses:
3.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE shall issue to CLEC one or

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
more Licenses per state authorizing CLEC to place or attach Facilities in or to specified Poles, Conduits,
Ducts or ROW owned or controlled by AT&T-22STATE located within the state on a “first-come, first-
served” basis. AT&T-22STATE may deny a License Application if AT&T-22STATE determines that the
Pole, Conduit or Duct space specifically requested by CLEC is necessary to meet AT&T-22STATE’s
present needs, or is Licensed by AT&T-22STATE to another CLEC, or is otherwise unavailable based on
engineering concerns. AT&T-22STATE shall provide written Notice to CLEC within a reasonable time
specifying in detail the reasons for denying CLEC’s request. AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to
designate the particular Duct(s) to be occupied, the location and manner in which CLEC’s Facilities will
enter and exit AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System and the specific location and manner of installation for any
associated equipment which is permitted by AT&T-22STATE to occupy the Conduit System.
3.4 Access and Use of ROW:
3.4.1 AT&T-22STATE acknowledges that it is required by the Act to afford CLEC access to and use of all
associated ROW to any sites where AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Poles, Manholes, Conduits,
Ducts or other parts of AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Conduit Systems are located.
3.4.2 AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC with access to and use of such ROW to the same extent and for the
same purposes that AT&T-22STATE may access or use such ROW, including but not limited to access for
ingress, egress or other access and to construct, utilize, maintain, modify, and remove Facilities for which
Pole attachment, Conduit Occupancy, or ROW use Licenses have been issued, provided that any
Agreement with a Third Party under which AT&T-22STATE holds such rights expressly or impliedly grants
AT&T-22STATE the right to provide such rights to others.
3.4.3 Where AT&T-22STATE notifies CLEC that AT&T-22STATE’s Agreement with a Third Party does not
expressly or impliedly grant AT&T-22STATE the ability to provide such access and use rights to others,
upon CLEC’s request, AT&T-22STATE will use its best efforts to obtain the owner’s consent and to
otherwise secure such rights for CLEC. CLEC agrees to reimburse AT&T-22STATE for the reasonable and
demonstrable Costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE in obtaining such rights for CLEC.
3.4.4 In cases where a Third Party Agreement does not grant AT&T-22STATE the right to provide access and
use rights to others as contemplated in Section 3.4.2 above and AT&T-22STATE, despite its best efforts, is
unable to secure such access and use rights for CLEC in accordance with Section 3.4.3 above, or, in the
case where CLEC elects not to invoke its rights under Section 3.4.2 above or Section 3.4.3 above, CLEC
shall be responsible for obtaining such permission to access and use such ROW. AT&T-22STATE shall

13.2.1.2 Results in the size or location of CLEC’s Facilities on AT&T-22STATE’s Poles or in its Conduit
or Ducts being appreciably different from those described and authorized in CLEC’s present
License (e.g. different Duct or size increase causing a need to re-calculate storm loadings,
guying, or Pole class).
14.0 Rearrangement of Facilities at the Request of Another
14.1 Make-Ready Work:
14.1.1 If it is determined that Make-Ready Work will be necessary to accommodate Attaching Party’s Facilities,
Attaching Party shall have forty-five (45) calendar days (the “acceptance period”) to either:
14.1.1.1 submit payment for the estimate authorizing AT&T-22STATE or its contractor to complete the
Make-Ready Work; or
14.1.1.2 advise AT&T-22STATE of its willingness to perform the proposed Make-Ready Work itself if
permissible in the application area.
14.1.2 Make-Ready Work performed by Attaching Party, or by an Authorized Contractor selected by Attaching
Party, shall be performed in accordance with AT&T-22STATE’s specifications and in accordance with the
same standards and practices which would be followed if such work were being performed by AT&T-
22STATE or AT&T-22STATE’s contractors. Neither Attaching Party nor Authorized Contractors selected by
Attaching Party shall conduct such work in any manner which degrades the integrity of AT&T-22STATE’s
Structures or interferes with any existing use of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities or the Facilities of any other
user.
14.1.3 AT&T-22STATE shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering judgment, whether or not Make-
Ready Work is necessary or possible. In determining whether Make-Ready Work is necessary or what
Make-Ready Work is necessary, AT&T-22STATE shall endeavor to minimize its Costs to CLEC. If it is
determined that such Make-Ready Work is required, AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC with the
estimated Costs for Make-Ready Work and a Make Ready-Work Due Date.
14.1.4 CLEC shall be solely responsible for negotiating with persons or entities other than AT&T-22STATE for the
rearrangement of such persons' or entities' Facilities or structures and, except where such rearrangement is
for the benefit of AT&T-22STATE and/or other CLECs as well as CLEC, shall be solely responsible for
paying all charges attributable to the rearrangement of such Facilities; provided, however, that if Facilities
rearrangements require new Licenses from AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall issue such Licenses in
conjunction with the issuance of the applied-for License to CLEC.
14.2 Rearrangement of CLEC’s Facilities at AT&T-22STATE’s Request:
14.2.1 CLEC acknowledges that, from time to time, it may be necessary or desirable for AT&T-22STATE to
change out Poles, relocate, reconstruct, or modify portions of its Conduit System or rearrange Facilities
contained therein or connected thereto and that such changes may be necessitated by AT&T-22STATE’s
business needs or authorized Application of another entity seeking access to AT&T-22STATE’s Poles or
Conduit Systems. CLEC agrees that CLEC will, upon AT&T-22STATE’s request, and at AT&T-22STATE’s
expense, but at no Cost to CLEC, participate with AT&T-22STATE (and other CLECs) in the relocation,
reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement. CLEC
acknowledges that, from time to time, it may be necessary or desirable for AT&T-22STATE to change out
Poles, relocate, reconstruct, or modify portions of its Conduit System or rearrange Facilities contained
therein or connected thereto as a result of an order by a municipality or other governmental authority. CLEC

shall, upon AT&T-22STATE’s request, participate with AT&T-22STATE (and other CLECs) in the
relocation, reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement
and pay its proportionate share of any costs of such relocation, reconstruction, or modification that are not
reimbursed by such municipality or governmental authority.
14.2.2 CLEC shall make all rearrangements of its Facilities within such period of time as is jointly deemed
reasonable by the parties based on the amount of rearrangements necessary and a desire to minimize
chances for service interruption or Facility-based service denial to a CLEC End User.
14.2.3 If CLEC fails to make the required rearrangements within the time prescribed or within such extended
periods of time as may be granted by AT&T-22STATE in writing, AT&T-22STATE may perform such
rearrangements with written Notice to CLEC, and CLEC shall reimburse AT&T-22STATE for actual costs
and expenses incurred by AT&T-22STATE in connection with the rearrangement of CLEC’s Facilities;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section or any License issued hereunder shall be
construed as requiring CLEC to bear any expenses which, under the Act or other applicable federal or state
laws or regulations, are to be allocated to persons or entities other than CLEC; and provided further,
however, that CLEC shall have no responsibility for rearrangement costs and expenses relating to
rearrangements performed for the purpose of meeting AT&T-22STATE’s business needs.
15.0 Emergency Repairs and Pole Replacements
15.1 Responsibility for Emergency Repairs; Access to Maintenance Duct:
15.1.1 In general, each Party shall be responsible for making emergency repairs to its own Facilities and for
formulating appropriate plans and practices enabling such Party to make such repairs.
15.1.2 Nothing contained in this Appendix shall be construed as requiring either Party to perform any repair or
service restoration work of any kind with respect to the other Party’s Facilities or the Facilities of joint users.
15.1.3 Maintenance Ducts shall be available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for emergency repair activities by any
entity with Facilities in the Conduit section in which the maintenance Duct is located; provided, however, that
an entity using the maintenance Duct for emergency repair activities will notify AT&T-22STATE within
twelve (12) hours of the current Business Day (or first Business Day following a non-business day) that such
entity is entering the AT&T-22STATE Conduit system and using the maintenance Duct for emergency
restoral purposes. The notice will include a description of the emergency and non-emergency services
involved and an estimate of the completion time. Maintenance Ducts will be used to restore the highest
priority services, first. Existing spare Ducts may be used for restoration purposes providing the spare Ducts
are restored after restoration work is complete. Any spare Ducts not returned will be included to be
assigned to the user of the Duct and an occupancy permit issued.
15.1.4 The Attaching Party shall either vacate the maintenance Duct within thirty (30) calendar days or, with AT&T-
22STATE’s consent, rearrange its Facilities to ensure that at least one full-sized replacement maintenance
Duct (or, if the designated maintenance Duct was an inner-Duct, a suitable replacement inner-Duct) is
available for use by all occupants in the Conduit section within thirty (30) calendar days after such Attaching
Party occupies the maintenance Ducts. If Attaching Party fails to vacate the maintenance Duct as described
above, AT&T-22STATE may install a maintenance conduit at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.2 Designation of Emergency Repair Coordinators and Other Information:
15.2.1 For each AT&T-22STATE construction district, Attaching Party shall provide AT&T-22STATE with the
emergency contact number of Attaching Party’s designated point of contact for coordinating the handling of
emergency repairs of Attaching Party’s Facilities and shall thereafter notify AT&T-22STATE of changes to
such information.

15.3 Order of Precedence of Work Operations; Access to Maintenance Duct and Other Unoccupied Ducts in Emergency
Situations:
15.3.1 When notice and coordination are practicable, AT&T-22STATE, Attaching Party, and other affected parties
shall coordinate repair and other work operations in emergency situations involving service disruptions.
Disputes will be immediately resolved at the site by the affected parties present in accordance with the
following principles.
15.3.2 Emergency service restoration work requirements shall take precedence over other work operations.
15.3.3 Except as otherwise agreed upon by the parties, restoration of lines for emergency services providers (e.g.,
911, fire, police, national security and hospital lines) shall be given the highest priority and temporary
occupancy of the maintenance Duct (and, if necessary, other unoccupied Ducts) shall be assigned in a
manner consistent with this priority. Secondary priority shall be given to restoring services to the local
service providers with the greatest numbers of local lines out of service due to the emergency being
rectified. The parties shall exercise good faith in assigning priorities, shall base their decisions on the best
information then available to them at the site in question, and may, by mutual agreement at the site, take
other factors into consideration in assigning priorities and sequencing service restoration activities.
15.3.4 AT&T-22STATE shall determine the order of precedence of work operations and assignment of Duct space
in the maintenance Duct (and other unoccupied Ducts) only if the affected parties present are unable to
reach consensus provided, however, that these decisions shall be made by AT&T-22STATE on a
nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the principles set forth in this section.
15.4 Emergency Pole Replacements
15.4.1 When emergency pole replacements are required, AT&T-22STATE shall promptly make a good faith effort
to contact Attaching Party to notify Attaching Party of the emergency and to determine whether Attaching
Party will respond to the emergency in a timely manner.
15.4.2 If notified by AT&T-22STATE that an emergency exists which will require the replacement of a pole,
Attaching Party shall transfer its Facilities immediately, provided such transfer is necessary to rectify the
emergency. If the transfer is to an AT&T-22STATE replacement pole, the transfer shall be in accordance
with AT&T-22STATE’s placement instructions.
15.4.3 If Attaching Party is unable to respond to the emergency situation immediately, Attaching Party shall so
advise AT&T-22STATE and thereby authorize AT&T-22STATE (or any Other User sharing the pole with
AT&T-22STATE) to perform such emergency-necessitated transfers (and associated Facilities
rearrangements) on Attaching Party’s behalf at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.5 Expenses Associated with Emergency Repairs:
15.5.1 Each Party shall bear all reasonable expenses arising out of or in connection with emergency repairs of its
own Facilities and transfers or rearrangements of such Facilities associated with emergency pole
replacements made in accordance with the provisions of this article.
15.5.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for paying all persons and entities that provide materials, labor,
access to real or personal property, or other goods or services in connection with any such repair, transfer,
or rearrangement of such Party’s Facilities.
15.5.3 Attaching Party shall reimburse AT&T-22STATE for the Costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE for work

16.1 AT&T-22STATE may monitor, at CLEC’s expense, the entrance and exit of CLEC’s Facilities into AT&T-22STATE’s
Manholes and the placement of CLEC’s Facilities in AT&T-22STATE’s Manholes.
16.2 Post-Construction Inspections:
16.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will, at the Attaching Party’s expense, conduct a post-construction inspection of the
Attaching Party’s attachment of Facilities to AT&T-22STATE’s Structures for the purpose of determining the
conformance of the attachments to the occupancy permit. AT&T-22STATE will provide the Attaching Party
advance written Notice of proposed date and time of the post-construction inspection. The Attaching Party
may accompany AT&T-22STATE on the post-construction inspection.
16.3 Periodic or Spot Inspections:
16.3.1 AT&T-22STATE shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make Periodic or Spot Inspections of all
Facilities attached to AT&T-22STATE’s Structure. Periodic Inspections will not be made more often than
once every two (2) years, unless in AT&T-22STATE’s judgment, such inspections are required for reasons
involving safety or because of an alleged violation of the terms of this Appendix.
16.3.2 AT&T-22STATE will give CLEC advance written Notice of such inspections, and CLEC shall have the right
to have a representative attend such inspections, except in those instances where safety considerations
justify the need for such inspection without the delay of waiting until written Notice has been forwarded to
CLEC.
16.3.3 Such inspections shall be conducted at AT&T-22STATE’s expense; provided, however, that CLEC shall
bear the Costs of inspections as delineated in Sections 16.1 above and 16.2.1 above.
16.3.4 If Attaching Party’s Facilities are in compliance with this Appendix, there will be no charges incurred by the
Attaching Party for the periodic or spot inspection. If Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with
this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE may charge Attaching Party for the inspection. The Costs of Periodic
Inspections will be paid by those Attaching Parties with 2% or greater of their Attachments in violation. The
amount paid by the Attaching Party shall be the percentage that their violations bear to the total violations of
all Attaching Parties found during the inspection.
16.3.5 If the inspection reflects that Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with the terms of this
Appendix, Attaching Party shall bring its Facilities into compliance within thirty (30) calendar days after being
notified of such noncompliance. If any make ready or modification work to AT&T-22STATE’s Structures is
required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the Attaching Party shall provide Notice to
AT&T-22STATE and the make ready work or modification will be treated in the same fashion as make
ready work or modifications for a new request for attachment. If the violation creates a hazardous condition,
Facilities must be brought into compliance upon notification.
16.4 Neither the act of inspection by AT&T-22STATE of CLEC’s Facilities nor any failure to inspect such Facilities shall
operate to impose on AT&T-22STATE any liability of any kind whatsoever or to relieve CLEC of any responsibility,
obligations or liability under this Section or otherwise existing.
16.5 Notice of Noncompliance:
16.5.1 If, at any time, AT&T-22STATE determines that Attaching Party’s Facilities or any part thereof have not
been placed or maintained or are not being used in accordance with the requirements of this Appendix,
AT&T-22STATE may send written Notice to Attaching Party specifying the alleged noncompliance.
Attaching Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of the Notice as soon as practicable. If Attaching Party does
not dispute AT&T-22STATE’s assertion that such Facilities are not in compliance, Attaching Party agrees to

into compliance within a reasonable time, and to notify AT&T-22STATE in writing when the Facilities have
been brought into compliance.
16.6 Disputes over Alleged Noncompliance:
16.6.1 If Attaching Party disputes AT&T-22STATE’s assertion that Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in
compliance, Attaching Party shall notify AT&T-22STATE in writing of the basis for Attaching Party’s
assertion that its Facilities are in compliance.
16.7 Failure to Bring Facilities into Compliance:
16.7.1 If Attaching Party has not brought the Facilities into compliance within a reasonable time or provided AT&T-
22STATE with proof sufficient to persuade AT&T-22STATE that AT&T-22STATE erred in asserting that the
Facilities were not in compliance, and if AT&T-22STATE determines in good faith that the alleged
noncompliance causes or is likely to cause material damage to AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities or those of other
users, AT&T-22STATE may, at its option and Attaching Party’s expense, take such non-service affecting
steps as may be required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, including but not limited to
correcting any conditions which do not meet the specifications of this Appendix.
16.8 Correction of Conditions by AT&T-22STATE:
16.8.1 If AT&T-22STATE elects to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the provisions of this section
shall apply.
16.8.2 AT&T-22STATE will, whenever practicable, notify CLEC in writing before performing such work. The
written Notice shall describe the nature of the work to be performed and AT&T-22STATE’s schedule for
performing the work.
16.8.3 If Attaching Party’s Facilities have become detached or partially detached from supporting racks or wall
supports located within an AT&T-22STATE Manhole, AT&T-22STATE may, at Attaching Party’s expense,
reattach them but shall not be obligated to do so. If AT&T-22STATE does not reattach Attaching Party’s
Facilities, AT&T-22STATE shall endeavor to arrange with Attaching Party for the reattachment of any
Facilities affected.
16.8.4 AT&T-22STATE shall, as soon as practicable after performing the work, advise Attaching Party in writing of
the work performed or action taken. Upon receiving such Notice, Attaching Party shall inspect the Facilities
and take such steps as Attaching Party may deem necessary to insure that the Facilities meet Attaching
Party’s performance requirements.
16.8.5 Attaching Party to Bear Expenses:
16.8.5.1 Attaching Party shall bear all expenses arising out of or in connection with any work performed to
bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance with this Section; provided, however that
nothing contained in this Section or any License issued hereunder shall be construed as
requiring Attaching Party to bear any expenses which, under applicable federal or state laws or
regulations, must be borne by persons or entities other than Attaching Party.

amended Occupancy permit with respect to such Facilities.
18.3 Approval of Request and Retroactive Charges:
18.3.1 If AT&T-22STATE approves Attaching Party’s Application for a new or amended Occupancy permit,
Attaching Party shall be liable to AT&T-22STATE for all fees and charges associated with the unauthorized
attachments as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this Agreement. The issuance of a new or amended
occupancy permit as provided by this article shall not operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-
22STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this Appendix or otherwise.
18.3.2 Attachment and Occupancy fees and charges shall continue to accrue until the unauthorized Facilities are
removed from AT&T-22STATE’s Poles, Conduit System or ROW or until a new or amended Occupancy
permit is issued and shall include, but not be limited to, all fees and charges which would have been due
and payable if Attaching Party and its predecessors had continuously complied with all applicable AT&T-
22STATE licensing requirements. Such fees and charges shall be due and payable thirty (30) calendar
days after the date of the bill or invoice stating such fees and charges. In addition, the Attaching Party shall
be liable for an unauthorized Attachment and/or Occupancy fee as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this
Agreement. Payment of such fees shall be deemed liquidated damages and not a penalty. In addition,
Attaching Party shall rearrange or remove its unauthorized Facilities at AT&T-22STATE’s request to comply
with applicable placement standards, shall remove its Facilities from any space occupied by or assigned to
AT&T-22STATE or another Other User, and shall pay AT&T-22STATE for all Costs incurred by AT&T-
22STATE in connection with any rearrangements, modifications, or replacements necessitated as a result of
the presence of Attaching Party’s unauthorized Facilities.

18.5.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-22STATE with regard to any unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or
unauthorized use of AT&T-22STATE’s Structure shall be deemed to constitute a ratification by AT&T-
22STATE of the unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or use, nor shall the payment by Attaching Party of
fees and charges for unauthorized Pole attachments or Conduit Occupancy exonerate Attaching Party from
liability for any trespass or other illegal or wrongful conduct in connection with the placement or use of such
unauthorized Facilities.
18.5.2 Nothing contained in the Appendix or any License issued hereunder shall be construed as requiring CLEC
to bear any expenses which, under applicable federal or state laws or regulations, must be borne by
persons or entities other than CLEC.

18.6.1 Fees and charges for Pole Attachments and Conduit System Occupancies, as specified herein and as
modified from time to time, shall be due and payable immediately whether or not CLEC is permitted to
continue the Pole Attachment or Conduit Occupancy. See the Pricing Schedule for applicable annual rental
fees.
18.7 No Implied Waiver or Ratification of Unauthorized Use:
18.7.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-22STATE with regard to said unlicensed use shall be deemed as a
ratification of the unlicensed use; and if any License should be subsequently issued, said License shall not
operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-22STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this
Appendix or otherwise; provided, however, that CLEC shall be subject to all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities of this Appendix in regard to said unauthorized use from its inception.
19.0 Removal of CLEC’s Facilities
19.1 When Applicant no longer intends to occupy space on an AT&T-22STATE Pole or in a AT&T-22STATE Duct or
Conduit, Applicant will provide written notification to AT&T-22STATE that it wishes to terminate the Occupancy
permit with respect to such space and will remove its Facilities from the space described in the Notice. Upon removal
of Applicant’s Facilities, the Occupancy permit shall terminate and the space shall be available for reassignment.
19.1.1 Attaching Party shall be responsible for and shall bear all expenses arising out of or in connection with the
removal of its Facilities from AT&T-22STATE’s Structure.
19.1.2 Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties, Applicant must, after removing its Facilities, plug
all previously occupied Ducts at the entrances to AT&T-22STATE’s Manholes.
19.1.3 Applicant shall be solely responsible for the removal of its own Facilities from AT&T-22STATE’s Structure.
19.2 At AT&T-22STATE’s request, Attaching Party shall remove from AT&T-22STATE’s Structure any of Attaching
Party’s Facilities which are no longer in active use. Upon request, the Attaching Party will provide proof satisfactory
to AT&T-22STATE that an Attaching Party’s Facility is in active service. Attaching Party shall not abandon any of its
Facilities by leaving such Facilities on or in AT&T-22STATE’s Structure.

19.3 Removal Following Termination of Occupancy Permit:
19.3.1 Attaching Party shall remove its Facilities from AT&T-22STATE’s Poles, Ducts, Conduits, or ROW within
thirty (30) calendar days after termination of the Occupancy permit.
19.4 Removal Following Replacement of Facilities:
19.4.1 Attaching Party shall remove Facilities no longer in service from AT&T-22STATE’s Structures within thirty
(30) calendar days after the date Attaching Party replaces existing Facilities on a Pole or in a Conduit with
substitute Facilities on the same Pole or in the same Conduit.
19.5 Removal to Avoid Forfeiture:
19.5.1 If the presence of Attaching Party’s Facilities on or in AT&T-22STATE’s Structure would cause a forfeiture
of the rights of AT&T-22STATE to occupy the property where such Structure is located, AT&T-22STATE
will promptly notify Attaching Party in writing and Attaching Party shall not, without due cause and
justification, refuse to remove its Facilities within such time as may be required to prevent such forfeiture.
AT&T-22STATE will give Attaching Party not less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of Notice to
remove Attaching Party’s Facilities unless prior removal is required to prevent the forfeiture of AT&T-
22STATE’s rights. At Attaching Party’s request, the Parties will engage in good faith negotiations with each
other, with Other Users, and with Third Party property owners and cooperatively take such other steps as
may be necessary to avoid the unnecessary removal of Attaching Party’s Facilities.
19.6 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-22STATE; Notice of Intent to Remove:
19.6.1 If Attaching Party fails to remove its Facilities from AT&T-22STATE’s Structure in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 19.1-19.5 of this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE may remove such Facilities and store
them at Attaching Party’s expense in a public warehouse or elsewhere without being deemed guilty of
trespass or conversion and without becoming liable to Attaching Party for any injury, loss, or damage
resulting from such actions. AT&T-22STATE shall give Attaching Party not less than thirty (30) calendar
days prior written Notice of its intent to remove Attaching Party’s Facilities pursuant to this Section.
19.7 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-22STATE:
19.7.1 If AT&T-22STATE removes any of Attaching Party’s Facilities pursuant to this article, Attaching Party shall
reimburse AT&T-22STATE for AT&T-22STATE’s Costs in connection with the removal, storage, delivery, or
other disposition of the removed Facilities.

this Agreement.
20.3 Notice of Rate and Computation of Charges:
20.3.1 On or about November 1 of each year, AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of the rental rate and Pole transfer rate to be applied in the subsequent calendar year. The letter
of notification shall be incorporated in, and governed by, the terms and conditions of this Appendix.
Attachment and Occupancy rates shall be applied to the number of Pole(s) and Duct feet of Conduit for
which Licenses have been issued before December 1 of each calendar year. Charges for Attachment(s) and
Occupancy which commenced during the preceding twelve (12) month period will be prorated accordingly.
20.4 Rate “True-Up”:
20.4.1 The Parties agree that the fees reflected as interim herein shall be “trued-up” (up or down) based on final
fees either determined by further agreement or by an effective order, in a proceeding involving AT&T-
22STATE before the Commission, in the state which CLEC has either attached to or occupied AT&T-
22STATE structures (ROW, Conduits, Ducts, and/or Poles).
20.4.2 Under the “True-Up” process, the interim fees for each structure shall be multiplied by the volume of that
structure either attached to or occupied by CLEC to arrive at the total interim amount paid (“Total Interim
Price”). The final fees for that structure shall be multiplied by the volume of that structure either attached to
or occupied by CLEC to arrive at the total final amount due (“Total Final Price”). The Total Interim Price
shall be compared with the Total Final Price. If the Total Final Price is more than the Total Interim Price,
CLEC shall pay the difference to AT&T-22STATE. If the Total Final Price is less than the Total Interim
Price, AT&T-22STATE shall pay the difference to CLEC.
20.4.3 Each Party shall keep its own records upon which a “True-Up” can be based and any final payment from
one Party to the other shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Parties based on such records. In the event
of any disagreement as between the records or the Parties regarding the amount of such “True-Up,” the
Parties agree to follow the Dispute Resolution Process in the General Terms & Conditions to this
Agreement.
21.0 Advance Payment
21.1 Attachment and Occupancy Fees:
21.2 Fees for Pole Attachment and Conduit Occupancy shall be based on the Facilities for which Licenses have been
issued as of the date of billing by AT&T-22STATE and shall be computed as set forth herein.
21.2.1 Charges associated with newly Licensed Attachments or Occupancies and other Attachments or
Occupancies of less than the entire annual billing period shall be prorated.
21.2.2 Charges shall be prorated retroactively in the event of the removal of CLEC’s Facilities.
21.2.3 The amount of any advance payment required shall be due within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of an
invoice from AT&T-22STATE.
22.0 Indemnification
22.1 In addition to the Indemnification clauses in the General Terms & Conditions to this Agreement, the following shall
apply to this Attachment:
22.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall exercise precaution to avoid damaging the Facilities of CLEC and shall make an
immediate report to CLEC of the occurrence of any such damage caused by its employees, agents or
contractors. AT&T-22STATE agrees to reimburse CLEC for all reasonable Costs incurred by CLEC for the

contractors, subcontractors or invitees. However, AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC for any
interruption of CLEC’s service or for interference with the operation of CLEC’s Facilities, or for any special,
indirect, or consequential damages arising in any manner, including AT&T-22STATE’s negligence, out of
the use of Pole(s), Anchor(s), or Conduit Systems or AT&T-22STATE’s actions or omissions in regard
thereto and CLEC shall indemnify and save harmless AT&T-22STATE from and against any and all claims,
demands, causes of action, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees with respect to such special, indirect or
consequential damages.
22.1.2 CLEC shall exercise precaution to avoid damaging the Facilities of AT&T-22STATE and of others attached
to Pole(s), Anchor(s), or occupying a Conduit System and shall make an immediate report to the Owner of
the occurrence of any such damage caused by CLEC’s employees, agents or contractors. CLEC agrees to
reimburse AT&T-22STATE for all reasonable Costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE for the physical repair of
such Facilities damaged by the negligence of CLEC.
22.1.3 CLEC shall indemnify, protect and save harmless AT&T-22STATE, its directors, officers, employees and
agents, AT&T-22STATE’s other CLECs, and Joint User(s) from and against any and all claims, demands,
causes of action, damages and Costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees through appeals incurred by
AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE’s other CLECs and Joint User(s) as a result of acts by the CLEC, its
employees, agents or contractors, including but not limited to the Costs of relocating Pole(s), Anchor(s),
Guy(s), or Conduit System resulting from a loss of ROW or property owner consents and/or the Costs of
defending those rights and/or consents.
22.1.4 The CLEC shall indemnify, protect and save harmless AT&T-22STATE, its directors, officers, employees

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Nothing in this Attachment shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely impact in any manner either Party's right
to employ or to request and be assigned any North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number resources from the
numbering administrator including, but not limited to, central office (NXX) codes pursuant to the Central Office Code
(NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s website) or thousand–blocks (NXX-X)
pursuant to the Thousands-Blocking Pooling Administration Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s
website), or to establish, by tariff or otherwise, Exchanges and Rate Centers corresponding to such NXX codes.
Each Party is responsible for administering the NXX codes it is assigned.
1.2 Prior to providing local service in an AT&T-22STATE local Exchange Area, CLEC shall obtain a separate numbering
resource (NXX or NXX-X) for each AT&T-22STATE Rate Center to ensure compliance with the industry-approved
Central Office Code (NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version) or other industry approved numbering
guidelines and the FCC’s Second Report & Order in CC Docket 95-116, released August 18, 1997 (Local Number
Portability). This will enable the Parties to identify the jurisdictional nature of traffic for Intercompany compensation
until such time as both Parties have implemented billing and routing capabilities to determine traffic jurisdiction on a
basis other than an NXX or an NXX-X.
1.3 Parties shall assign telephone numbers only to those End Users that are physically in the Rate Center to which the
NXX is assigned, subject to exceptions as noted in the numbering resource guidelines.
1.4 Each Party is responsible to program and update its own switches and network systems to recognize and route traffic
to the other Party's assigned NXX codes at all times. Neither Party shall impose fees or charges on the other Party
for such required programming and updating activities.
1.5 Each Party is responsible to input required data into the Routing Data Base Systems (RDBS) and into the Telcordia
Business Integrated Routing and Rating Database System (BIRRDS) or other appropriate system(s) necessary to
update the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), unless negotiated otherwise.
1.6 Neither Party is responsible for notifying the other Party’s End Users of any changes in dialing arrangements,
including those due to NPA relief.
1.7 NXX Migration:
1.7.1 Where either Party has activated an entire NXX for a single End User, or activated more than half of an NXX
for a single End User with the remaining numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use or otherwise
unused, and such End User chooses to receive service from the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate
with the second Party to have the entire NXX reassigned in the LERG (and associated industry databases,
routing tables, etc.) to an End Office operated by the second Party provided that the requested rate center is
the same rate center that physically serves the End User in a non-Foreign Exchange arrangement. Such
transfer will require development of a transition process to minimize impact on the Network and on the End
User(s)' service and will be subject to appropriate industry lead times (currently forty-five (45) calendar days)
for movements of NXXs from one switch to another. The Party to whom the NXX is migrated will pay NXX
migration charges per NXX to the Party formerly assigned the NXX as described in the Pricing Schedule.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Foreign Exchange” or “FX”, as used in this Attachment, refers to number assignments and moves outside the Rate
Centers with which a telephone number is ordinarily associated, and is different from the term “FX” in Attachment 02
- Network Interconnection, which refers to number assignment and moves outside of a mandatory local calling area.

Page 4 of 8
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
2.2 “Service Management System” or “SMS”, as used in the Attachment, is a database or computer system not part of
the public switched network that, (1) interconnects to a Service Control Point (SCP), and sends to that SCP the
information and call processing instructions needed for a network switch to process and complete a telephone call;
and (2) provides telecommunications carriers with the capability of entering and storing data regarding the processing
and completing of a telephone call.
2.3 “Service Provider Number Portability (SPNP) Data Base Query” means the End User terminating calls from the "N-1"
Network to numbers in the Telephone Company's network with NXX codes that have been designated as number
portable and the NXX has at least one number ported. AT&T-22STATE may be responsible for making a query to a
database containing information necessary to route calls to number portable NXX codes.
2.4 “Intermediate Numbers” means the numbers provided for use by resellers, numbers in dealer numbering pools,
numbers preprogrammed into End User premises equipment offered for retail sale, and numbers assigned to
messaging service providers.
2.5 “Safety Valve Request” means a mechanism for carriers to request numbering resources apart from the general
waiver process.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 Requirements for LNP:
3.1.1 The Parties shall provide to each other, on a reciprocal basis, number portability in accordance with
requirements of the Act and FCC Rules and Orders
3.1.2 The Parties shall follow industry guidelines, including but not limited to North American Numbering Council
(NANC) Inter Service Provider Operations Flows, located on the Number Portability Administration Center's
(NPAC) website, regarding LNP for all aspects of number portability, including the time frames for providing
porting services to one another.
3.1.3 Either Party shall be permitted to block default-routed calls to protect the public switched telephone network
from overload, congestion, or failure propagation.
3.1.4 When a ported telephone number becomes vacant, (e.g., the telephone number is no longer in service with
the original End User), the ported telephone number will be released back to the carrier owning the switch
(after aging if any) in which the telephone number’s NXX-X is native.
3.1.5 Each Party shall be responsible for the End User’s other Telecommunications related services and features,
e.g., Directory Listings, E911, Line Information Database (LIDB), Operator Services), once that Party has
ported the End User’s telephone number to the Party’s switch.
3.1.6 When purchasing the SPNP Database Query, CLEC will access AT&T-22STATE facilities via an SS7 link.
3.1.7 Where triggers are not set, the Parties shall coordinate the porting of the number between service providers
so as to minimize service interruptions to the End User.
3.2 Limitations of Service for LNP:
3.2.1 Telephone numbers can be ported only within the Toll Message Rate Centers (TMRCs) as approved by the
Commissions. “Porting within Rate Centers” refers to a limitation of changing service providers while the
physical location of the End User remains with the wireline footprint of the Rate Center. If the End User
changes his, her or its physical location from one Rate Center to another, the End User may not retain his,
her or its telephone number (which is associated with the End User’s previous Rate Center) as a basic
network (non-FX) offering. An End User may retain his, her or its telephone number when moving from one

Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
Rate Center to another by the use of a tariff FX or Remote Call Forwarding offering from the new service
provider.
3.2.2 Telephone numbers of the following types shall not be ported:
3.2.2.1 AT&T-22STATE Official Communications Services (OCS) NXXs;
3.2.2.2 555, 950, 956, 976 and 900 numbers;
3.2.2.3 N11 numbers (e.g., 411 and 911);
3.2.2.4 toll-free service numbers (e.g., 800, 888, 877 and 866); and
3.2.2.5 disconnected or unassigned numbers.
3.2.3 Telephone numbers with NXXs dedicated to choke/High Volume Call-In (HVCI) networks are not portable
via LRN. Choke numbers will be ported as described in Section 4.4.7.2 below of this Attachment.
3.3 Numbering:
3.3.1 If fulfilling CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers results in AT&T-22STATE having to submit a request
for additional telephone numbers to a national numbering administrator (either NANPA CO Code
Administration, NeuStar Pooling Administration or their successors), AT&T-22STATE will submit the
required numbering request to the national numbering administrator to satisfy CLEC’s request for
intermediate numbers. AT&T-22STATE will also pursue all appropriate steps (including submitting a Safety
Valve Request (petition) to the Commission if the numbering request is denied by the national administrator)
to satisfy CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers. In these cases, AT&T-22STATE is not obligated to
fulfill the request by CLEC for intermediate numbers unless, and until, AT&T-22STATE’s request for
additional numbering resources is granted.
3.3.2 CLEC agrees to supply supporting information for any numbering request and/or Safety Valve Request that
AT&T-22STATE files pursuant to Section 3.3.1 above.
3.3.3 Each Party is responsible for providing to the other, valid test numbers; one number terminating to a voice
announcement identifying the Company and one number terminating to a milliwatt tone providing answer
supervision and allowing simultaneous connection from multiple test lines. Both numbers should remain in
service indefinitely for regressive testing purposes.
3.4 Local Number Portability (LNP) and Numbering:
3.4.1 Porting of Resale Numbers:
3.4.1.1 As the network provider, AT&T-22STATE will port telephone numbers, both in and out, on behalf
of CLEC at the request of an End User. CLEC will provide to AT&T-22STATE such information as
required to issue Local Service Requests (LSR) to port numbers in.
3.5 Non-discriminatory Access to Telephone Numbers:
3.5.1 Where AT&T-22STATE provides Resale services, AT&T-22STATE will provide telephone numbers as
defined by applicable FCC rules and regulations on a first come first served basis. CLEC acknowledges
that such access to telephone numbers shall be in accordance with the appropriate FCC rules, regulations
and industry guidelines.

4.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
4.1 Service Description for LNP:
4.1.1 The LRN software of the switch in which the assigned numbering resource (e.g., NXX or NXX-X) is native
determines if the called party is in a portable NXX. When a calling Party places a telephone call, if the
called party is in a portable NXX, a query will be launched to the LNP database to determine whether or not
the called number has been ported.
4.1.2 When the called number has been ported, an LRN will be returned to the switch that launched the query.
Following the query, the LRN of the called number will appear in the Called Party Number (CdPN) field of
the SS7 message and the called number will appear in the Generic Address Parameter (GAP) field.
4.1.3 When the query does not return an LRN, the call will be completed based upon the dialed digits.
4.1.4 When the LNP database is queried, the Forward Call Identifier (FCI) field’s entry will be changed from 0 to 1
by the switch triggering the query, regardless of whether the called number has been ported or not.
4.1.5 Where technically feasible, the Parties shall populate the Jurisdictional Identification Parameter (JIP) field
with the first six (6) digits (NPA NXX format) of the appropriate LRN of the terminating switch.
4.2 “N-1” Query Methodology for LNP:
4.2.1 The Parties shall follow the “N-1” query methodology in performing queries of the LNP database, as
provided below. As provided by Industry standards, the “N-1” carrier is the carrier in the call routing
sequence immediately prior to the terminating carrier’s End Office, or the terminating carrier’s End Office
tandem. The “N-1” carrier shall perform the LNP database query. If the “N-1” carrier fails to perform the
LNP database query, the terminating carrier shall perform a query of the LNP database, and shall be
permitted to charge the “N-1” carrier for the query. Refer to the LNP Working Group Best Practice for
additional information, located in the Local Number Portability Administration section of the NPAC website.
4.2.2 For interLATA or intraLATA toll calls carried by another carrier, the originating carrier will pass the call to the
appropriate toll carrier, which will perform a query of the LNP database and efficiently route the call to the
appropriate terminating local carrier, either directly or through an access tandem office. Where one carrier
is the originating local service provider (LSP) and the other carrier is the designated toll carrier, the
designated toll carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating LSP will not query toll calls delivered to the toll
carrier or charge the toll carrier for such queries.
4.2.3 For local calls to ported numbers, the originating carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating carrier will query
the LNP database and route the call to the appropriate terminating carrier.
4.2.4 For local calls to any NXX from which at least one number has been ported, the Party that owns the
originating switch shall query an LNP database as soon as the call reaches the first LNP-capable switch in
the call path. The Party that owns the originating switch shall query on a local call to an NXX in which at
least one number has been ported via LNP prior to any attempts to route the call to any other switch. Prior
to the first number in an NXX being ported via LNP, AT&T-22STATE may query all calls directed to that
NXX, provided that AT&T-22STATE’s queries shall not adversely affect the quality of service to CLEC’s End
Users as compared to the service AT&T-22STATE provides its own End Users, and that queries to NXXs
where the first number has not been ported are not charged to the “N-1” Carrier.
4.2.5 A Party shall be charged for an LNP query by the other Party only if the Party to be charged is the N-1
carrier and was obligated to perform the LRN query but failed to do so, pursuant to conditions set forth in
CFR 47, Section 52.33. The only exception will be if the FCC rules (Docket No. 95-116) that the

AT&T-22STATE E911 SR location.
4.1.2 CLEC will forward the ANI information of the party calling 911 to the AT&T-22STATE E911 SR.
4.2 Facilities and Trunking (for CLEC’s own switches):
4.2.1 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to each AT&T-22STATE E911 SR that
serves the Exchange Areas in which CLEC is authorized to and will provide Telephone Exchange Service.
4.2.2 CLEC acknowledges that its End Users in a single local calling scope may be served by different E911 SRs
and CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to route 911 calls from its End Users to
the proper E911 SR.
4.2.3 CLEC shall order a minimum of two (2) one-way outgoing E911 Trunk(s) dedicated for originating 911
Emergency Service calls for each default PSAP or default ESN to interconnect to each appropriate AT&T-
22STATE E911 SR, where applicable. Where Signaling System 7 (SS7) connectivity is available and
required by the applicable E911 Customer, the Parties agree to implement Common Channel Signaling
(CCS) trunking rather than Multi-Frequency (MF) trunking.
4.2.4 CLEC is responsible for ordering a separate E911 Trunk group from AT&T-22STATE for each county,
default PSAP or other geographic area that the CLEC serves if the E911 Customer for such county or
geographic area has a specified varying default routing condition. Where PSAPs do not have the technical
capability to receive 10-digit ANI, E911 traffic must be transmitted over a separate trunk group specific to
the underlying technology. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this
trunk group. Where the parties utilize SS7 signaling and the E911 network has the technology available,
only one (1) E911 Trunk group shall be established to handle multiple NPAs within the local Exchange Area
or LATA. If the E911 network does not have the appropriate technology available, a SS7 trunk group shall
be established per NPA in the local Exchange Area or LATA. In addition, 911 traffic originating in one (1)
NPA must be transmitted over a separate 911 Trunk group from 911 traffic originating in any other NPA 911.
4.2.5 CLEC shall maintain facility transport capacity sufficient to route 911 traffic over trunks dedicated to 911
Interconnection between the CLEC switch and the AT&T-22STATE E911 SR.

4.2.10 CLEC shall monitor its 911 Trunks for the purpose of determining originating network traffic volumes. If
CLEC's traffic study indicates that additional 911 Trunks are needed to meet the current level of 911 call
volumes, CLEC shall provision additional 911 Trunks for Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE.
4.2.11 CLEC is responsible for the isolation, coordination and restoration of all 911 facility and trunking
maintenance problems from CLEC’s demarcation (for example, collocation) to the AT&T-22STATE E911
SR(s). CLEC is responsible for advising AT&T-22STATE of the 911 Trunk identification and the fact that
the trunks are dedicated for 911 traffic when notifying AT&T-22STATE of a failure or outage. The Parties
agree to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve any 911 outage. AT&T-22STATE will refer
network trouble to CLEC if no defect is found in AT&T-22STATE’s 911 network. The Parties agree that 911
network problem resolution will be managed expeditiously at all times.
4.2.12 CLEC will not turn up live traffic until successful testing of E911 Trunks is completed by both Parties.
4.2.13 Where required, CLEC will comply with Commission directives regarding 911 facility and/or 911 Trunking
requirements.

1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Schedule based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider, and CLEC may convert facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice versa,
as described below in Section 3.6.8 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Schedule.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 INW:

1.5 White Pages:
1.5.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to switched-based CLECs for subscriber listing
information in White Page directories provided by AT&T-22STATE owned ILEC and the CLEC.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “CLEC Subscriber” means CLEC End User, as End User is defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this
Agreement.
2.2 “General Assistance” means a service in which an operator calls the INW operator seeking assistance in dialing a
number. For example, the assistance could be required for attempting to dial a number where a ‘no ring’ condition
has been encountered.
2.3 “Busy Line Verification (BLV)” means a service in which an operator asks the INW operator to verify a conversation in
progress.
2.4 “Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I)” means a service in which an operator asks the INW operator to interrupt a
conversation in progress, to determine if one of the parties is willing to speak to the caller requesting the interrupt.
2.5 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit Access Tandem Code (ATC) code that uniquely identifies a tandem switch
in the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions. An
operator dials the appropriate area code + ATC + OPR SVC CODE to obtain INW.
2.6 “Operator Service Code (OPR SVC CODE)” means the operator dialable code assigned in the LERG for INW.
2.7 “Facilities-Based CLEC” – A CLEC that provides service through its own switch, a Third Party provider’s switch or via
local circuit switching leased from AT&T-22STATE via a stand-alone agreement.
3.0 Operator Services (OS) / Directory Services (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-22STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-22STATE’s OS and DA platforms with the same priority and
using the same methods as for AT&T-22STATE’s retail End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-22STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-22STATE retail End
Users served via that same AT&T-22STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This Section describes the Parties’ physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facility-Based
CLEC that wishes to interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s OS/DA switches
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the Point of
Interconnection (POI) for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum
must be in the Local Access And Transport Area (LATA) within which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411,
1411, or 555-1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.

Page 5 of 13
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of
the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411, 1411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical
billing address, regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the
OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-22STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for only OS, or only DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-22STATE Local Tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
22STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-22STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
22STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-22STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
22STATE End Offices to the AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-
Digit Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized,
and a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups, and their Requirements:
3.3.6.1 OS Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
22STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group
will be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the
trunk group transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then
the group will be designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for
combined services. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2 DA/ DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch
to the AT&T-22STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk
group transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.

Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-13STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use
code and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together
on a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate
traffic use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose
of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI) Trunks:
3.3.6.3.1 Where available, when CLEC wishes for AT&T-22STATE to perform Busy Line
Verification or Emergency Interrupt for CLEC End Users a segregated one-way
BLV trunk group with MF signaling from AT&T-22STATE’s Operator Services
switch to CLEC’s switch serving End Users in that LATA will be required. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way
trunk group. The BLV trunk group will be designated with the appropriate traffic
use code and modifier.
3.4 OS Offerings:
3.4.1 Operator Services Rate Structure:
3.4.1.1 AT&T-22STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is
receiving (a) manual OS (i.e., provided a live Operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch
equipment voice recognition feature, functioning either fully or partially without live Operators
where feasible). The Pricing Schedule contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring
rates.
3.4.2 Operator Services Call Processing:
3.4.2.1 Whether manual or automated, AT&T-22STATE will provide the following services when
processing a 0- or 0+ dialed call from CLEC’s line, regardless of whether DA is also requested:
3.4.2.1.1 General Assistance - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to
provide local and intraLATA dialing assistance for the purposes of completing calls,
or requesting information on how to place calls e.g., handling emergency calls,

3.4.2.1.2 Calling Card - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, provides the OS Operator with a
Calling Card number for billing purposes, and seeks assistance in completing the
call.
3.4.2.1.3 Collect - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to bill the charges
associated with the call to the called number, provided such billing is accepted by
the called number.
3.4.2.1.4 Third Number Billed - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to bill
the call to a different number than the calling or called number.
3.4.2.1.5 Person-To-Person Service - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator
for assistance in reaching a particular person or a particular PBX station,
department or office to be reached through a PBX attendant. This service applies

3.5.1.1 AT&T-22STATE charges one rate for local DA, and a separate rate for all other DA products. In
both cases DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The
Pricing Schedule contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 DA Call Processing:
3.5.2.1 Where technically feasible and available, AT&T-22STATE will provide the following DA Services
when a CLEC End User served dials 411, 1-411, or 555-1212 regardless of whether CLEC also
requests OS from AT&T-22STATE:
3.5.2.1.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name, address and
telephone number to the dialing End User.
3.5.2.1.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an
intraLATA call to the requested number is completed on behalf of the DA End User,
utilizing an automated voice system or with operator assistance.
3.5.2.1.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request DA
outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.1.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - An Information Service consisting of
providing listed local and national name and address information associated with a
telephone number provided by the individual originating the call.
3.5.2.1.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - Where available, a service in which the End
User may request business telephone number listings for a specified category of

be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e. Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 The incoming OS/DA call is automatically answered by a pre-recorded greeting loaded into the OS/DA
switch itself, prior to being handled by automated equipment or a live operator. CLEC may custom brand or
brand with silence.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-22STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC OnLine website.
PPaaggee 115501 ooff 453332 CCCS 150 of 424

Page 8 of 13
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
3.6.1.2 AT&T-22STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner.
CLEC will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.2 If CLEC does not wish to custom brand the OS/DA calls, CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting
with the OS/DA switch by having AT&T-22STATE load a recording of silence into the automatic, pre-
recorded announcement slot, set for the shortest possible duration allowed by the switch, to then be routed
to automated or live operators as with all other OS/DA calls, for which brand loading charges will still apply.
3.6.2.1 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary
mechanical handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.2.2 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-22STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to
identify the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.3 AT&T-22STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided recording or the silent announcement
into all applicable OS and/or DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at
parity with that provided to AT&T-22STATE retail End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial
recording or silent announcement loading charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any
subsequent loading charges if a new recordings or silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.4 Branding/Silent Announcement load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For
example, a CLEC Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facility-based operations,
and therefore two separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the Branding/Silent
Announcement charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing
Schedule.
3.6.5 Where Reference Rater is available, the applicable CLEC-charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided
contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office or repair call center) are loaded into the system
utilized by the OS/DA Operator.
3.6.6 Where Reference Rater is available, AT&T-22STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided
OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC-provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will be
responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.
3.6.7 Rate/Reference load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where Reference Rater is
available, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its facility-
based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
Rate/Reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing
Schedule.
3.6.8 Converting End Users from Prior Branded Service to CLEC or Silent-Branded Service, or between Resale
and facilities-based service:
3.6.8.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no Non-
Recurring Charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.8.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then Non-Recurring

intrastate Special Access Tariff.
4.1.3 The CLEC will initiate an ASR for a one-way trunk group from its designated operator assistance switch to
the AT&T-22STATE Operator assistance switch utilizing MF signaling.
4.2 CLEC will request in writing, thirty calendar (30) days in advance of the date when the INW are to be provided,
unless otherwise agreed to by AT&T-22STATE. CLEC or its designated OS providers shall submit an ASR to AT&T-
22STATE to establish any new interconnection trunking arrangements.
4.2.1 CLEC must provide one (1) Carrier Identification Code (CIC) for its CLEC or Incumbent Exchange Carrier
business operation and an additional CIC for its IXC business operation if the CLEC wishes to receive
separate billing data for its CLEC and IXC operations.
4.3 Specifics of INW Offering and Pricing:
4.3.1 Toll Center Codes will be used by the CLEC operators for routing and connecting to the AT&T-22STATE
Operator assistance switches. These codes are specific to the various AT&T-22STATE LATAs where
AT&T-22STATE Operator assistance switches are located.
4.3.2 AT&T-22STATE OS will require a Toll Center Code for the CLEC OS assistance switch. This code will be
the routing code used for connecting the AT&T-22STATE operator to the CLEC operator on an Inward
basis.
4.3.3 If the CLEC requires establishment of a new Toll Center Code, CLEC shall do so by referencing the LERG.
4.3.4 AT&T-22STATE pricing for INW shall be based on the rates specified in the Pricing Schedule.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for nondiscriminatory access to Operations Support Systems (OSS)
“functions” to CLEC for pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance/repair, and billing provided by AT&T-
22STATE. CLEC represents and covenants that it will only use OSS furnished pursuant to this Agreement for
activities related to 251(c)(3) UNEs (as provided in Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs, resold services, or other
services covered by this Interconnection Agreement ICA Service(s)).
1.2 Should AT&T-22STATE no longer be obligated to provide a 251(c)(3) UNE or other ICA Service under the terms of
this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE shall no longer be obligated to offer access and use of OSS for that ICA Service.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Service Bureau Provider (SBP)” means a company which has been engaged by a CLEC to act on its behalf for
purposes of accessing AT&T-22STATE OSS application-to-application interfaces via a dedicated connection over
which multiple CLEC’s local service transactions are transported.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-22STATE’s OSS are comprised of systems and processes that are in some cases region-specific (hereinafter
referred to as “Regional OSS”). Regional OSS is available only in the regions where such systems and processes
are currently operational.
3.2 AT&T-22STATE will provide electronic access to OSS via web-based GUIs and application-to-application interfaces.
These GUIs and interfaces will allow CLEC to perform pre-order, order, provisioning, maintenance and repair
functions. AT&T-22STATE will follow industry guidelines and the Change Management Process (CMP) in the
development of these interfaces.
3.3 AT&T-22STATE will provide all relevant documentation (manuals, user guides, specifications, etc.) regarding
business rules and other formatting information, as well as practices and procedures, necessary to handle OSS
related requests. All relevant documentation will be readily accessible at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
Documentation may be amended by AT&T-22STATE in its sole discretion from time to time. All Parties agree to
abide by the procedures contained in the then-current documentation.
3.4 AT&T-22STATE’s OSS are designed to accommodate requests for both current and projected demands of CLEC
and other CLECs in the aggregate.
3.5 CLEC shall advise AT&T-22STATE no less than seven (7) Business Days in advance of any anticipated ordering
volumes above CLEC’s normal average daily volumes.
3.6 It is the sole responsibility of CLEC to obtain the technical capability to access and utilize AT&T-22STATE’s OSS
interfaces. All hardware and software requirements for the applicable AT&T-22STATE Regional OSS are specified
on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.7 CLEC must access the AT&T-22STATE OSS interfaces as indicated in the connectivity specifications and methods
set forth on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.

3.10 CLEC agrees that there may be Resale service and 251(c)(3) UNEs available on a regional basis and that such
regional offering may only be ordered where they are made available in accordance with Resale or 251(c)(3)UNE
Attachments. Moreover, CLEC shall not be permitted to order ICA Services unless CLEC has a right, under this
Agreement, to order such service.
3.11 AT&T-22STATE shall provide nondiscriminatory access to OSS processes. When OSS processes are not available
electronically, AT&T-22STATE shall make manual processes available.
3.12 The Parties agree that a collaborative CMP will be used to manage changes to existing interfaces, introduction of
new interfaces and retirement of interfaces. The CMP will cover changes to AT&T-22STATE’s electronic interfaces,
AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC testing environment, associated manual process improvements, and relevant
documentation. The process will define a procedure for resolution of CMP disputes.
3.13 Due to enhancements and on-going development of access to AT&T-22STATE CLEC OSS functions, certain
interfaces may be modified, may be temporarily unavailable, or may be phased out after execution of this Agreement.
AT&T-22STATE shall provide proper notice of interface phase-out in accordance with CMP.

3.15 Proper Use of OSS Interfaces
3.15.1 CLEC shall use AT&T-22STATE electronic interfaces, as described herein, exclusively for the purposes
specifically provided herein. In addition, CLEC agrees that such use will comply with AT&T-22STATE’s
Data Connection Security Requirements as identified in Section 9.0 below of this Attachment. Failure to
comply with the requirements of this Attachment, including such security guidelines, may result in forfeiture
of electronic access to OSS functionality. In addition, CLEC shall be responsible for and indemnifies AT&T-
22STATE against any cost, expense or liability relating to any unauthorized entry or access into, or use or
manipulation of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS from CLEC systems, workstations or terminals or by CLEC
employees, agents, or any Third Party gaining access through information and/or facilities obtained from or
utilized by CLEC and shall pay AT&T-22STATE for any and all damages caused by such unauthorized
entry.
3.15.2 CLEC’s access to pre-order functions will only be used to view Customer Proprietary Network Information
(CPNI) of another carrier’s End User where CLEC has obtained an authorization from the End User for
release of CPNI.
3.15.2.1 CLEC must maintain records of individual End Users’ authorizations for change in local
Exchange Service and release of CPNI which adhere to all requirements of state and federal
law, as applicable.
3.15.2.2 CLEC is solely responsible for determining whether proper authorization has been obtained and
holds AT&T-22STATE harmless from any loss on account of CLEC’s failure to obtain proper
CPNI consent from an End User. The Parties agree not to view, copy, or otherwise obtain
access to the customer record information about any other carriers’ End Users without proper
permission. CLEC will obtain access to End User customer record information only in strict
compliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations of the state in which the service is
provided.
3.15.3 AT&T-22STATE shall be free to connect an End User to any CLEC based upon that CLEC’s request and
that CLEC’s assurance that proper End User authorization has been obtained. CLEC shall make any such
authorization it has obtained available to AT&T-22STATE upon request and at no charge.

3.15.4 By using electronic interfaces to access OSS functions, CLEC agrees to perform accurate and correct
ordering of ICA Services. CLEC is also responsible for all actions of its employees using any of AT&T-
22STATE’s OSS. As such, CLEC agrees to accept and pay all reasonable costs or expenses, including
labor costs, incurred by AT&T-22STATE caused by any and all inaccurate ordering or usage of the OSS, if
such costs are not already recovered through other charges assessed by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC. In
addition, CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T-22STATE harmless against any claim made by an End
User of CLEC or Third Parties against AT&T-22STATE caused by or related to CLEC’s use of any AT&T-
22STATE OSS.
3.15.5 In the event AT&T-22STATE has good cause to believe that CLEC has used AT&T-22STATE OSS in a
way that conflicts with this Agreement or Applicable Law, AT&T-22STATE shall give CLEC written Notice
describing the alleged misuse (“Notice of Misuse”). CLEC shall immediately refrain from the alleged misuse
until such time that CLEC responds in writing to the Notice of Misuse, which CLEC shall provide to AT&T-
22STATE within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Misuse. In the event CLEC agrees
with the allegation of misuse, CLEC shall refrain from the alleged misuse during the term of this Agreement.
3.15.6 In the event CLEC does not respond to the Notice of Misuse or does not agree that the CLEC’s use of
AT&T-22STATE OSS is inconsistent with this Agreement or Applicable Law, then the Parties agree to the
following steps:
3.15.6.1 If such misuse involves improper access of pre-order applications or involves a violation of the
security guidelines contained herein, or negatively affects another OSS user’s ability to use OSS,
CLEC shall continue to refrain from using the particular OSS functionality in the manner alleged
by AT&T-22STATE to be improper, until CLEC has implemented a mutually agreeable remedy
to the alleged misuse.
3.15.6.2 To remedy the misuse for the balance of the Agreement, the Parties will work together as
necessary to mutually determine a permanent resolution for the balance of the term of the
Agreement.
3.16 In order to determine whether CLEC has engaged in the alleged misuse described in the Notice of Misuse, AT&T-
22STATE shall have the right to conduct an audit of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-22STATE OSS. Such audit shall be
limited to auditing those aspects of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-22STATE OSS that relate to the allegation of misuse as
set forth in the Notice of Misuse. AT&T-22STATE shall give ten (10) calendar days advance written Notice of its
intent to audit CLEC (“Audit Notice”) under this Section, and shall identify the type of information needed for the audit.
Such Audit Notice may not precede the Notice of Misuse. Within a reasonable time following the Audit Notice, but no
less than fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of the Audit Notice (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties),
CLEC shall provide AT&T-22STATE with access to the requested information in any reasonably requested format, at
an appropriate CLEC location, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. The audit shall be at AT&T-22STATE’s
expense. All information obtained through such an audit shall be deemed proprietary and/or confidential and subject
to confidential treatment without necessity for marking such information confidential. AT&T-22STATE agrees that it
shall only use employees or outside parties to conduct the audit who do not have marketing, strategic analysis,
competitive assessment or similar responsibilities within AT&T-22STATE. If CLEC fails to cooperate in the audit,
AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to terminate CLEC’s access to electronic processes.

associated with each telephone number where applicable. CLEC shall provide such information within four (4) hours
after requested via electronic access where available. If electronic access is not available, CLEC shall provide to
AT&T-22STATE paper copies of End User record information, including circuit numbers associated with each
telephone number where applicable. CLEC shall provide such End User service records within twenty-four (24)
hours of a valid request, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
4.4 Data validation files provided are described on the AT&T CLEC Online website. These files provide an alternate
method of acquiring pre-ordering information that is considered relatively static and are available via the pre-order
GUI, AT&T’s CLEC Online website, or other distribution methods.
5.0 Ordering
5.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide ordering functionality. To order any ICA Services CLEC will format a Local Service
Request (LSR) to identify the features, services or elements CLEC is requesting AT&T-22STATE to provision in
accordance with applicable AT&T-22STATE ordering requirements and other terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Ordering requirements are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.2 In ordering and provisioning, Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT) and local Interconnection trunks, CLEC and
AT&T-22STATE will use industry Access Service Request (ASR) guidelines, based upon AT&T-22STATE ordering
requirements. AT&T-22STATE’s ASR guidelines are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.3 AT&T-22STATE product/service intervals are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.4 AT&T-22STATE shall return a Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) in accordance with the applicable performance
intervals. CLEC shall provide to AT&T-22STATE an FOC per the guidelines located on AT&T’s CLEC Online
website.
5.5 When an AT&T-22STATE provided ICA Service is replaced by CLEC’s facility-based service using any AT&T-
22STATE provided ICA Services, CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests, to both disconnect the existing
service and order ICA Services. These requests will be processed by AT&T-22STATE, and CLEC will be charged
the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each individual ICA
Service and cross-connect ordered. Similarly, when an End User is served by one CLEC using AT&T-22STATE
provided ICA Services is converted to another CLEC’s service using any AT&T-22STATE provided ICA Services, the
requesting CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests to both disconnect the existing service and connect new
service to the requesting CLEC End User. These requests will be processed by AT&T-22STATE and the CLEC will
be charged the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each
individual ICA Service and cross-connect ordered.
5.6 AT&T-22STATE shall bill to CLEC an LSR charge and/or appropriate service order charges based on the manner in
which the order is submitted (e.g. manually, semi-mechanized, mechanized) at the rate set forth in the applicable
Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides to this Agreement for each LSR submitted. An
individual LSR will be identified for billing purposes by its Purchase Order Number (PON).

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
5.7 The Commissions, in some states, have ordered per element manual additive nonrecurring charges for ICA Services
ordered by means other than one of the interactive interfaces (“Additional Charges”). Additional Charges shall
charges will apply in these states as set forth in the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or
service guides.
6.0 Provisioning
6.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory provisioning of ICA Services. Access to order status and
provisioning order status is available via the regional pre-ordering and ordering GUIs, AT&T’s CLEC Online website,
and application-to-application interfaces.
6.2 AT&T-22STATE shall provision services during its regular working hours. To the extent CLEC requests provisioning
of service to be performed outside AT&T-22STATE’s regular working hours, or the work so requested requires
AT&T-22STATE’s technicians or project managers to work outside of regular working hours, AT&T-22STATE will
assess overtime charges set forth in the Pricing Schedule/AT&T-22STATE’s intrastate Access Services Tariff.
6.3 In the event AT&T-22STATE must dispatch to the End User’s location more than once for provisioning of ICA
Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect contact
name/number, etc.), AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to provision the circuit due
to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-22STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges from the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides.
6.4 Cancellation Charges:
6.4.1 If CLEC cancels an order for ICA Services subsequent to AT&T-22STATE’s generation of a service order,
any costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE in conjunction with provisioning of services as requested on the
cancelled LSR will be recovered in accordance with the cancellation methodology set forth in the
Cancellation Charge Percentage Chart found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website. In addition, AT&T-
22STATE reserves the right to assess cancellation charges if CLEC fails to respond within nine (9)
Business Days to a Missed Appointment order notification.
6.4.1.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CLEC places an LSR based upon AT&T-22STATE’s loop
makeup information, and such information is inaccurate resulting in the inability of AT&T-
22STATE to provision the ICA Services requested and another spare compatible facility cannot
be found with the transmission characteristics of the ICA Services originally requested,
cancellation charges shall not apply. Where CLEC places a single LSR for multiple ICA Services
based upon loop makeup information, and information as to some, but not all, of the ICA
Services is inaccurate, if AT&T-22STATE cannot provision the ICA Services that were the
subject of the inaccurate loop makeup information, CLEC may cancel its request for those ICA
Services without incurring cancellation charges. In such instance, should CLEC elect to cancel
the entire LSR, cancellation charges as shall apply to those ICA Services that were not the
subject of inaccurate loop makeup.
6.5 Expedite Charges:
6.5.1 For Expedite requests by CLEC, charges from the Pricing Schedule or Connecticut Access Service Tariff
will apply for intervals less than the standard interval as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
6.6 Order Modification Charges:
6.6.1 If CLEC modifies an order after being sent a FOC from AT&T-22STATE, the Order Modification Charge
(OMC) or Order Modification Charge Additional Dispatch (OMCAD) will be accessed from the Pricing
Schedule as applicable.

order to permit AT&T-22STATE to test and make adjustments appropriate for maintaining the 251(c)(3) UNEs in
satisfactory operating condition. No credit will be allowed for any interruptions involved during such testing and
adjustments.
7.5 Neither CLEC or its End Users shall rearrange, move, disconnect, remove or attempt to repair any facilities owned by
AT&T-22STATE except with the prior written consent of AT&T-22STATE.
7.6 CLEC will be responsible for testing and isolating troubles on ICA Services. CLEC must test and isolate trouble to
the AT&T-22STATE network before reporting the trouble to the Maintenance Center. Upon request from AT&T-
22STATE at the time of the trouble report, CLEC will be required to provide the results of the CLEC test isolating the
trouble to the AT&T-22STATE network.
7.7 For all ICA Services repair requests, CLEC shall adhere to AT&T-22STATE’s prescreening guidelines prior to
referring the trouble to AT&T-22STATE.
7.8 CLEC will contact the appropriate AT&T-22STATE repair centers in accordance with procedures established by
AT&T-22STATE.
7.9 AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to contact CLEC’s End Users, if deemed necessary, for provisioning or
maintenance purposes.
7.10 Repair requests are billed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If CLEC reports a trouble on a
AT&T-22STATE ICA Service and no trouble is found in AT&T-22STATE’s network, AT&T-22STATE will charge
CLEC a Maintenance of Service Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material
Charges/Additional Labor Charges for any dispatching and testing (both inside and outside the Central Office)
required by AT&T-22STATE in order to confirm the working status. AT&T-22STATE will assess these charges at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule and/or applicable tariffs.
7.11 In the event AT&T-22STATE must dispatch to an End User’s location more than once for repair or maintenance of
ICA Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect
contact name/number, etc.), AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to repair the circuit
due to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-22STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
7.12 CLEC shall pay Time and Material charges when AT&T-22STATE dispatches personnel and the trouble is in
equipment or communications systems provided an entity by other than AT&T-22STATE or in detariffed CPE
provided by AT&T-22STATE, unless covered under a separate maintenance agreement.
7.13 CLEC shall pay Maintenance of Service charges when the trouble clearance did not otherwise require dispatch, but
dispatch was requested for repair verification or cooperative testing, and the circuit did not exceed maintenance
limits.

7.14 If CLEC issues a trouble report allowing AT&T-22STATE access to End User's premises and AT&T-22STATE
personnel are dispatched but denied access to the premises, then Time and Material charges will apply for the period
of time that AT&T-22STATE personnel are dispatched. Subsequently, if AT&T-22STATE personnel are allowed
access to the premises, these charges will still apply.
7.15 Time and Material charges apply on a first and additional basis for each half-hour or fraction thereof. If more than
one technician is dispatched in conjunction with the same trouble report, the total time for all technicians dispatched
will be aggregated prior to the distribution of time between the “First Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” and “Each
Additional Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” rate categories. Basic Time is work-related efforts of AT&T-22STATE
performed during normally scheduled working hours on a normally scheduled workday. Overtime is work-related
efforts of AT&T-22STATE performed on a normally scheduled workday, but outside of normally scheduled working
hours. Premium Time is work related efforts of AT&T-22STATE performed other than on a normally scheduled
workday.
7.15.1 If CLEC requests or approves an AT&T-22STATE technician to perform services in excess of or not
otherwise contemplated by the nonrecurring charges herein, CLEC will pay Time and Material charges for
any additional work to perform such services, including requests for installation or other work outside of
normally scheduled working hours.
8.0 Billing
8.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory access to associated billing information as necessary to
allow CLEC to perform billing functions.
8.1.1 The charges for bill data are dependent upon the manner in which such bill data is delivered to CLEC.
8.1.1.1 CLEC agrees to pay the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
9.0 Data Connection Security Requirements
9.1 CLEC agrees to comply with AT&T-22STATE data connection security procedures, including but not limited to
procedures on joint security requirements, information security, user identification and authentication, network
monitoring, and software integrity. These procedures are set forth on the AT&TCLEC Online website.

requirements cannot be met, the Parties will institute mutually agreed upon alternative security controls and
safeguards to mitigate risks.
9.4.6 All network-related problems will be managed to resolution by the respective organizations, CLEC or AT&T-
22STATE, as appropriate to the ownership of a failed component. As necessary, CLEC and AT&T-
22STATE will work together to resolve problems where the responsibility of either Party is not easily
identified.
9.5 Information Security Policies And Guidelines For Access To Computers, Networks and Information By Non-Employee
Personnel:
9.5.1 Information security policies and guidelines are designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and
availability of computer, networks and information resources. Section 9.6 below through Section 9.12 below
inclusive summarizes the general policies and principles for individuals who are not employees of the Party
that provides the computer, network or information, but have authorized access to that Party’s systems,
networks or information. Questions should be referred to CLEC or AT&T-22STATE, respectively, as the
providers of the computer, network or information in question.
9.5.2 It is each Party’s responsibility to notify its employees, contractors and vendors who will have access to the
other Party’s network, on the proper security responsibilities identified within this Attachment. Adherence to
these policies is a requirement for continued access to the other Party’s systems, networks or information.
Exceptions to the policies must be requested in writing and approved by the other Party’s information
security organization.
9.6 General Policies:
9.6.1 Each Party’s resources are for approved this Agreement’s business purposes only.
9.6.2 Each Party may exercise at any time its right to inspect, record, and/or remove all information contained in
its systems, and take appropriate action should unauthorized or improper usage be discovered.
9.6.3 Individuals will only be given access to resources that they are authorized to receive and which they need to
perform their job duties. Users must not attempt to access resources for which they are not authorized.
9.6.4 Authorized users shall not develop, copy or use any program or code which circumvents or bypasses
system security or privilege mechanism or distorts accountability or audit mechanisms.
9.6.5 Actual or suspected unauthorized access events must be reported immediately to each Party’s security
organization or to an alternate contact identified by that Party. Each Party shall provide its respective
security contact information to the other.
9.7 User Identification:
9.7.1 Access to each Party’s corporate resources will be based on identifying and authenticating individual users
in order to maintain clear and personal accountability for each user’s actions.
9.7.2 User identification shall be accomplished by the assignment of a unique, permanent user ID, and each user
ID shall have an associated identification number for security purposes.
9.7.3 User IDs will be revalidated on a monthly basis.
9.8 User Authentication:
9.8.1 Users will usually be authenticated by use of a password. Strong authentication methods (e.g. one-time
passwords, digital signatures, etc.) may be required in the future.
PPaaggee 116678 ooff 453332 CCCS 167 of 424

Page 169 of 430 Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems/AT&T-22STATE
Page 12 of 14
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
9.8.2 Passwords must not be stored in script files.
9.8.3 Passwords must be entered by the user.
9.8.4 Passwords must be at least six (6) to eight (8) characters in length, not blank or a repeat of the user ID;
contain at least one (1) letter, and at least one (1) number or special character must be in a position other
than the first or last position. This format will ensure that the password is hard to guess. Most systems are
capable of being configured to automatically enforce these requirements. Where a system does not
mechanically require this format, the users must manually follow the format.
9.8.5 Systems will require users to change their passwords regularly (usually every thirty-one (31) days).
9.8.6 Systems are to be configured to prevent users from reusing the same password for six (6) changes/months.
9.8.7 Personal passwords must not be shared. Any user who has shared his password is responsible for any use
made of the password.
9.9 Access and Session Control:
9.9.1 Destination restrictions will be enforced at remote access facilities used for access to OSS Interfaces.
These connections must be approved by each Party’s corporate security organization.
9.9.2 Terminals or other input devices must not be left unattended while they may be used for system access.
Upon completion of each work session, terminals or workstations must be properly logged off.
9.10 User Authorization:
9.10.1 On the destination system, users are granted access to specific resources (e.g. databases, files,
transactions, etc.). These permissions will usually be defined for an individual user (or user group) when a
user ID is approved for access to the system.
9.11 Software and Data Integrity:
9.11.1 Each Party shall use a comparable degree of care to protect the other Party’s software and data from
unauthorized access, additions, changes and deletions as it uses to protect its own similar software and
data. This may be accomplished by physical security at the work location and by access control software on
the workstation.
9.11.2 All software or data shall be scanned for viruses before use on a Party’s corporate facilities that can be
accessed through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS interfaces.
9.11.3 Unauthorized use of copyrighted software is prohibited on each Party’s corporate systems that can be
accessed through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS Interfaces.
9.11.4 Proprietary software or information (whether electronic or paper) of a Party shall not be given by the other
Party to unauthorized individuals. When it is no longer needed, each Party’s proprietary software or
information shall be returned by the other Party or disposed of securely. Paper copies shall be shredded.
Electronic copies shall be overwritten or degaussed.
9.12 Monitoring and Audit:
9.12.1 To deter unauthorized access events, a warning or no trespassing message will be displayed at the point of
initial entry (i.e., network entry or applications with direct entry points). Each Party should have several
approved versions of this message. Users should expect to see a warning message similar to this one:
“This is a(n) (AT&T or CLEC) system restricted to Company official business and subject
to being monitored at any time. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
monitoring and to any evidence of unauthorized access, use, or modification being used
for criminal prosecution.”
9.12.2 After successful authentication, each session will display the last logon date/time and the number of
unsuccessful logon attempts. The user is responsible for reporting discrepancies.
10.0 Miscellaneous
10.1 To the extent AT&T-22STATE seeks to recover costs associated with OSS system access and connectivity, AT&T-
22STATE shall not be foreclosed from seeking recovery of such costs via negotiation, arbitration, or generic
proceeding during the term of this Agreement.
10.2 Unless otherwise specified herein, charges for the use of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS, and other charges applicable to
pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning and maintenance and repair, shall be at the applicable rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule.
10.3 Single Point of Contact:
10.3.1 CLEC will be the single point of contact with AT&T-22STATE for ordering activity for ICA Services used by
CLEC to provide services to its End Users, except that AT&T-22STATE may accept a request directly from
another CLEC, or AT&T-22STATE, acting with authorization of the affected End User. Pursuant to a
request from another carrier, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect any ICA Service being used by CLEC to
provide service to that End User and may reuse such network elements or facilities to enable such other
carrier to provide service to the End User. AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been
processed but will not be required to notify CLEC in advance of such processing.
10.4 Use of Facilities:
10.4.1 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another LEC, including
AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as ICA Services, and regardless of whether the End User served
with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or otherwise.
AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
10.5 AT&T-22STATE will provide loss notifications to CLEC. This notification alerts CLEC that a change requested by
another Telecommunications provider has/or may result in a change in the Local Service Provider associated with a
given telephone number. It will be provided via the ordering GUI and application-to-application interfaces and
AT&T’s CLEC Online website, as applicable.
11.0 Service Bureau Provider Arrangements for Shared Access to OSS
11.1 Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement regarding access to OSS to the contrary, CLEC shall be permitted
to access AT&T-22STATE OSS via a Service Bureau Provider as follows:
11.1.1 CLEC shall be permitted to access AT&T-22STATE application-to-application OSS interfaces, via a Service
Bureau Provider where CLEC has entered into an agency relationship with such Service Bureau Provider,
and the Service Bureau Provider has executed an Agreement with AT&T-22STATE to allow Service Bureau
Provider to establish access to and use of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS.
11.1.2 CLEC’s use of a Service Bureau Provider shall not relieve CLEC of the obligation to abide by all terms and
conditions of this Agreement. CLEC must ensure that its agent properly performs all OSS obligations of
CLEC under this Agreement, which CLEC delegates to Service Bureau Provider.

11.1.3 It shall be the obligation of CLEC to provide Notice in accordance with the Notice provisions of the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement whenever it establishes an agency relationship with a Service
Bureau Provider or terminates such a relationship. AT&T-22STATE shall have a reasonable transition time
to establish a connection to a Service Bureau Provider once CLEC provides Notice. Additionally, AT&T-
22STATE shall have a reasonable transition period to terminate any such connection after Notice from
CLEC that it has terminated its agency relationship with a Service Bureau Provider.
11.2 AT&T-22STATE shall not be obligated to pay liquidated damages or assessments for noncompliance with a
performance measurement to the extent that such noncompliance was the result of actions or events beyond AT&T-
22STATE’s control associated with Third Party systems or equipment including systems, equipment and services
provided by a Service Bureau Provider (acting as CLEC’s agent for connection to AT&T-22STATE’s OSS) which
could not be avoided by AT&T-22STATE through the exercise of reasonable diligence or delays or other problems
resulting from actions of a Service Bureau Provider, including Service Bureau provided processes, services, systems
or connectivity.

Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
1.0 Introduction
1.1 The Parties agree that CLEC is entitled to order any Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be made available
by FCC requirements pursuant to the Act. A Bona Fide Request (BFR) is to be used when CLEC makes a request of
AT&T-22STATE to provide a new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element that is not currently offered by AT&T-
22STATE but is required to be made available via the Act.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “BFR” means a Bona Fide Request pursuant to the Act.
2.2 “Complex Request Evaluation Fee” means an Individual Case Basis (ICB) fee to compensate AT&T-22STATE for
the extraordinary expenses directly related to the CLEC’s BFR which is a complex request that requires the allocation
and engagement of additional resources above the existing allocated resources used on BFR cost development
which include, but are not limited to, expenditure of funds to develop feasibility studies, specific resources that are
required to determine request requirements (such as operation support system analysts, technical managers,
software developers), software impact analysis by specific software developers; software architecture development,
hardware impact analysis by specific system analysts, etc.
2.3 “Development Rate” means the estimated cost for AT&T-22STATE to develop the new or modified 251(c)(3) element
and other network elements.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 A BFR shall be submitted by CLEC on the BFR Application Form, located on the AT&T CLEC Online website, to the
designated AT&T-22STATE Local Service Specialist and shall specifically identify the requested service date,
technical requirements, and/or such other specifications that clearly define the request such that AT&T-22STATE
has sufficient information to analyze and prepare a response. Such a request shall also include CLEC’s designation
of the BFR as being pursuant to the Act.
3.1.1 CLEC shall include with its BFR Application Form a “BFR Deposit” to cover preliminary evaluation costs.
See Pricing Schedule for the BFR Deposit amount.
3.1.2 If the BFR Deposit amount identified in the Pricing Schedule is not made at the time of the BFR Application,
CLEC shall be responsible for all preliminary evaluation costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE to complete the
preliminary analysis (regardless of whether such costs are greater or lesser than the BFR Deposit amount in
the Pricing Schedule).
3.1.3 If CLEC submits a BFR Deposit with its BFR, and AT&T-22STATE is not able to process the request or
determines that the request does not qualify for BFR treatment, then AT&T-22STATE will credit the BFR
Deposit amount to the CLEC’s account. Similarly, if the costs incurred to complete the Preliminary Analysis
are less than the BFR Deposit, the balance of the deposit will, at the option of CLEC, either be credited
toward the CLEC’s account or credited toward any additional developmental costs authorized by CLEC.
3.2 Within two (2) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of a fully complete and valid BFR, AT&T-22STATE shall
acknowledge, in writing, its receipt and identify a single point of contact responsible for responding to the BFR and
shall request any additional information needed to process the BFR to the extent known at that time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE may reasonably request additional information from CLEC at any
time during the processing of the BFR.
3.3 For any new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be unbundled by Act, if AT&T-22STATE
determines that the preliminary analysis of the requested BFR is of such complexity that it will cause AT&T-
22STATE to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR, AT&T-22STATE shall notify CLEC within ten (10)

Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of the BFR that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee will be required prior
to the preliminary analysis of the BFR being performed by AT&T-22STATE. If CLEC accepts the Complex Request
Evaluation Fee proposed by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC shall submit such fee within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-
22STATE’s notice that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee is required. AT&T-22STATE will not be obligated to
further process the BFR until such Complex Request Evaluation Fee is received by AT&T-22STATE. Within thirty
(30) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, AT&T-22STATE shall
respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis.
3.4 If AT&T-22STATE is not required to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR as described in Section 3.3
above, then within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s fully complete and valid BFR,
AT&T-22STATE shall respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis of the new or modified Section 251 or
251(c)(3) element. The preliminary analysis shall confirm either that AT&T-22STATE will or will not offer the new or
modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element.
3.5 CLEC may cancel a BFR at any time up until thirty (30) Business Days after receiving AT&T-22STATE’s preliminary
analysis. If CLEC cancels the BFR within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of AT&T-22STATE’s preliminary
analysis, AT&T-22STATE shall be entitled to retain the BFR Deposit or any Complex Request Evaluation Fee, minus
those costs that have not been incurred by AT&T-22STATE as of the date of cancellation.
3.6 CLEC will have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the preliminary analysis to accept the preliminary analysis.
CLEC must provide acceptance of the preliminary analysis in writing and provide the payment of the estimated
Development Rate for the new or modified network element quoted in the preliminary analysis. If CLEC fails to
respond within this thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR will be deemed cancelled.
3.7 As soon as feasible, but not more than ninety (90) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s written
acceptance of the preliminary analysis and payment of the estimated Development Rate, AT&T-22STATE shall
provide to CLEC a firm price quote. The firm price quote will include any additional Development Rates, the
nonrecurring rate and the recurring rate, and a detailed implementation plan. The firm nonrecurring rate will not
include any of the Development Rate or the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, if required, in the calculation of this
rate
3.8 CLEC shall have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the firm price quote to accept or deny the firm price quote
in writing and submit any additional Development Rates or nonrecurring rates quoted in the firm price quote. If
AT&T-22STATE does not receive Notice of any of the foregoing within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR
shall be deemed canceled. CLEC shall be responsible to reimburse AT&T-22STATE for its costs incurred up to the
date of cancellation (whether affirmatively canceled or deemed canceled by AT&T-22STATE).
3.9 Unless CLEC agrees otherwise, all prices shall be consistent with the applicable pricing principles and provisions of
the Act.
3.10 If CLEC believes that AT&T-22STATE’s firm price quote is not consistent with the requirements of the Act, either
Party may seek dispute resolution in accordance with the Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
3.11 Upon agreement to the rates, terms and conditions of the BFR, an amendment to this Agreement may be required
and the Parties shall negotiate such amendment in good faith.

this Agreement, are not intended to create, modify or otherwise affect Parties’ rights and obligations. The existence
of any particular performance measure, or the language describing that measure, is not evidence that CLEC is
entitled to any particular manner of access, nor is it evidence that AT&T-22STATE is limited to providing any
particular manner of access. The Parties’ rights and obligations to such access are defined elsewhere, including the
relevant laws, FCC and Commission decisions/regulations, and in the case of Connecticut, state tariffs, and within
this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T-22STATE’s implementation of the Performance Measurements Plans addressed by this Attachment
(Performance Measurement Plan(s), the Plan(s)) will not be considered as an admission against interest or an
admission of liability in any legal, regulatory, or other proceeding relating to the same performance. The Parties
agree that CLEC may not use the existence of such Plans as evidence that AT&T-22STATE has discriminated in the
provision of any facilities or services under Sections 251 or 252, or has violated any state or federal law or regulation.
AT&T-22STATE’s conduct underlying its performance, and the performance data provided under the Performance
Measurements Plans, however, are not made inadmissible by these terms. AT&T-22STATE’s performance as
measured by these plans may not be used as an admission of liability or culpability for a violation of any state or
federal law or regulation.
1.3 Nothing herein shall be interpreted to be a waiver of AT&T-22STATE’s right to argue and contend in any forum, in
the future, that Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 do not impose any duty or legal
obligation to negotiate and/or mediate or arbitrate a self-executing liquidated damages or remedy plan.

complete responsibility of the originating LEC or CLEC. If messages are lost by any Party, and cannot be recreated
or retransmitted, the originating LEC or CLEC will estimate messages, minutes, and associated revenues based on
the best available data. No estimate will be made for messages, which are more than two (2) years old at the time

7.1 CLEC agrees that it will provide AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE billing records for CH processing that are in
industry standard format acceptable to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. The records shall at minimum
display the telephone number of the End User to whom the call is to be billed, and data about the call sufficient for a
carrier to comply with all applicable state regulatory billing requirements. CH Records will detail intraLATA toll calls
which were originated by use of the single digit access code (i.e., 0+ and 0-) in one LEC or CLEC Exchange but are
to be billed to an End User in a second LEC’s or CLEC Exchange. Such records are referred to as category ninety-
two (92) records for CH processing purposes.
7.2 CLEC agrees that all CH Records it generates will display indicators denoting whether category ninety-two (92)
Records should be forwarded to CH. CLEC will retain its originating records for ninety (90) calendar days such that
the category ninety-two (92) Records can be retransmitted to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE for CH
processing, if needed.
7.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will provide and maintain such systems it believes are required to furnish
the CH service described herein. AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, in its capacity as operator of the CH,
agrees to retain all CH Records processed through the CH for two (2) years.
7.4 CLEC will timely furnish to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE all CH Records required to provide the CH
service.
7.5 Presently, in operating the CH, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE relies upon NXX codes to identify messages
for transmission to participating billing companies. To the extent any sub-processes are required to settle CH
messages due to the use of ported numbers, such sub-processing will be the responsibility of the porting entity.
8.0 CH Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
8.1 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will issue monthly reports containing the results of the processing of CH
Records to each participating LEC and CLEC. These reports list the:

9.0 Limitation of Liability
9.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Limitation of Liability will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions of
this Agreement.
9.2 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE assumes no liability for any LEC’s or CLEC's receipt of appropriate
revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable
to it for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports
or performing any other act under this Attachment.
9.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable for any losses or damages arising out of errors,
interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those
arising from associated equipment and data processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole
negligence of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE is held liable under this Attachment for CH will in no event exceed the amount of processing
charges incurred by CLEC for the services provided hereunder during the period beginning at the time AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE receives notice of the error, interruption, defect, failure or malfunction, to the time
service is restored.
9.4 CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE harmless against and with respect to
any and all Third Party claims, demands, liabilities or court actions arising from any of its actions, omissions,
mistakes or negligence occurring during the course of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE’s performance
pursuant to this Attachment.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions under which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will perform the revenue settlement of LEC-carried intrastate/intraLATA or
interstate/intraLATA local/toll alternately billed calls between each of the aforementioned regions and the CLEC via
the Centralized Message Distribution System (CMDS) Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS) reports.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS)” means a revenue settlement process for messages which originate from
CLEC and bill to AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and messages
which originate from AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and bill to
CLEC. NICS messages must originate and bill within the same AT&T-Owned ILEC across the fourteen (14)
individual states which make up these two regions.
2.2 “Non-Intercompany Settlements System” or “NICS System” means the national system administered by Telcordia
that is used in the settlement of revenues for calls that are originated and billed by two (2) different Local Exchange
Carriers (LECs) within a single CMDS Direct Participant’s territory to another for billing. NICS applies to calls
involving another LEC where the Earning Company and the Billing Company are located within both AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 NICS shall apply only to alternately billed messages (calling card, third number billed and collect calls) originated by
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE billed by CLEC (when the CLEC is
using its own End Office Switch),or messages originated by CLEC and billed by AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE
and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE within the same AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE State (i.e., messages for intrastate/intraLATA traffic only).
3.1.1 For example, an alternately billed call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS territory and billed to a CLEC within
AT&T-ILLINOIS would be covered by this section; a call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS but billing
outside of AT&T-ILLINOIS would not be covered by NICS.
3.2 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also collect the revenue earned by CLEC within the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE territory from another LEC also within the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE where the
messages are billed, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing Schedule, on behalf of
CLEC. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will remit the revenue billed by CLEC within region to the LEC also
within region, where the messages originated, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing
Schedule. These two amounts will be netted together by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and the resulting
charge or credit issued to CLEC via a monthly invoice in arrears.
3.3 NICS does not extend to 900 or 976 calls or to other pay per call services.
3.4 The Telcordia Technologies NICS report is the source for revenue to be settled between AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and CLEC. NICS settlement will be incorporated into the CLEC's
monthly invoice.
3.5 This Attachment does not cover calls originating and billing within a state outside of AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.6 NICS does not include any interLATA and/or intraLATA long distance charges assessed by an Interexchange Carrier
(IXC).
3.7 The Party billing the End User shall be responsible for all uncollectible amounts.
3.8 Net payment shall be due within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the invoice.

4.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
4.1 Each Party is responsible for submitting the appropriate Exchange Message Interface (EMI) End User billable record
(as defined in the Telcordia Technologies NICS System Specifications document) to Telcordia CMDS for inclusion in
the NICS report when an alternately billed call originates from its End User.
5.0 Limitation of Liability
5.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Limitation of Liability will be governed by the General Terms & Conditions of
this Agreement:
5.1.1 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE assume no liability for
any LEC’s or CLEC’s receipt of appropriate revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable to it
for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports or performing any other act under this
Attachment.
5.1.2 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable for
any losses or damages arising out of errors, interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services
provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those arising from associated equipment and data
processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole negligence of AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is held liable under this
Attachment will in no event exceed the amount that CLEC would have billed AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE per CLEC’s existing tariff for the services provided
hereunder during the period beginning at the time AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE receives notice of the error, interruption, failure or malfunction, to the time
service is restored.
5.1.3 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&TSOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE assumes no
responsibility with regard to the correctness of the data supplied by CLEC when this data is accessed and
used by a Third Party.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC a Daily Usage File (DUF) for services provided
hereunder. A DUF will be provided by AT&T-22STATE in accordance with Exchange Message Interface (EMI)
guidelines supported by the Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF). Any exceptions to the supported formats will be
noted in the DUF implementation requirements documentation. The DUF will include (i) specific daily usage,
including both Section 251(b)(5) Traffic (if and where applicable) and LEC-carried IntraLATA Toll Traffic, in EMI
format for usage sensitive services furnished in connection with each service to the extent that similar usage
sensitive information is provided to retail End Users of AT&T-22STATE within that state, (ii) with sufficient detail to
enable CLEC to bill its End Users for usage sensitive services furnished by AT&T-22STATE in connection with
service provided by AT&T-22STATE, and (iii) operator handled calls provided by AT&T-22STATE. Procedures and
processes for implementing the interfaces with AT&T-22STATE will be included in implementation requirements
documentation.
2.0 General Provisions
2.1 Where available, DUF may be requested on flat-rated Resale lines as well as measured-rated Resale lines. DUF
provided in this instance is labeled as Enhanced DUF (EDUF). In order to receive EDUF on flat-rated Resale lines,
CLEC must also request and receive DUF on its measure-rated Resale lines.
2.2 File transmission for DUF is requested by each unique State and OCN combination. CLEC must provide to AT&T-
22STATE a separate written request for each unique State and OCN combination no less than sixty (60) calendar
days prior to the desired first transmission date for each file.
2.3 AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for DUF in accordance with the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule
under “Electronic Billing Information Data (Daily Usage) per message”, “Provision of Message Detail a.k.a. Daily
Usage File (DUF), “FB-CLEC Operator Recording (Daily Usage) per message”, and “Daily Usage File (DUF) Data
Transmission, per Message.“ There will be individual rates listed for DUF provided for measure-rated Resale lines
and for EDUF provided on flat-rated Resale lines.
2.4 Call detail for LEC-carried calls that are alternately billed to CLEC End Users’ lines provided by AT&T-22STATE
through Resale will be forwarded to CLEC as rated call detail on the DUF.
2.5 Interexchange call detail on Resale Services that is forwarded to AT&T-22STATE for billing, which would otherwise
be processed by AT&T-22STATE for its retail End Users, will be returned to the IXC and will not be passed through
to CLEC. This call detail will be returned to the IXC with a transaction code indicating that the returned call originated
from a resold account. Billing for Information Services and other ancillary services traffic on Resale Services will be
passed through when AT&T-22STATE records the message.
2.6 Where CLEC is operating its own switch-based service and has contracted with AT&T-22STATE to provide operator
services, upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC a DUF for operator handled calls
handled by AT&T-22STATE.

and photo and Collocator’s name. AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to remove from an AT&T-22STATE
Premises any employee of Collocator not possessing identification issued by Collocator or who has violated
any of AT&T-22STATE’s policies as outlined in the CLEC Security Training documents.
4.11.3.1 Collocator technicians will be security-qualified by the Collocator and will be required to be
knowledgeable of AT&T-22STATE’s security standards. Collocator personnel and technicians
will undergo the same level of security training or its equivalent that AT&T-22STATE’s own
employees and authorized contractors must undergo. AT&T-22STATE will not, however,
require Collocator to receive security training from AT&T-22STATE, but will provide information
to Collocator on the specific type of training required. Collocator can then provide its employees
with its own security training.

4.11.3.2 Collocator and AT&T-22STATE will each establish disciplinary procedures up to and including
dismissal or denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other property of AT&T-22STATE for
certain specified actions that damage, or place the equipment, facilities, or the network or
personnel of the Collocator or AT&T-22STATE in jeopardy. The following are actions that could
damage or place the Eligible Structure, or the network or the personnel of the Collocator or
AT&T-22STATE in jeopardy and may justify disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or
the denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other AT&T-22STATE property:
4.11.3.2.1 Theft or destruction of AT&T-22STATE’s or Collocator’s property;
4.11.3.2.2 Use/sale or attempted use/sale of alcohol or illegal drugs on AT&T-22STATE
property;
4.11.3.2.3 Threats or violent acts against other persons on AT&T-22STATE property;
4.11.3.2.4 Knowing violations of any local, state or federal law or the requirements of this
Agreement on AT&T-22STATE property;
4.11.3.2.5 Permitting unauthorized persons access to AT&T-22STATE or Collocator’s
equipment on AT&T-22STATE property; and
4.11.3.2.6 Carrying a weapon on AT&T-22STATE property
4.11.3.3 In addition, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to interview Collocator’s employees, agents,
suppliers, or Guests in the event of wrongdoing in or around an AT&T-22STATE Premises or
involving AT&T-22STATE’s or another Collocated Telecommunications Carrier’s property or
personnel, provided that AT&T-22STATE shall provide reasonable notice to Collocator’s
Security representative of such interview. Collocator and its employees, agents, suppliers, or
Guests shall reasonably cooperate with AT&T-22STATE’s investigation into allegations of
wrongdoing or criminal conduct committed by, witnessed by, or involving Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests. Additionally, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to bill
Collocator for all reasonable costs associated with investigations involving its employees,
agents, suppliers, or Guests if it is established and mutually agreed in good faith that Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests are responsible for the alleged act(s). Collocator and
AT&T-22STATE will take appropriate disciplinary steps as determined by each Party to address
any violations reported by AT&T-22STATE or the Collocator.
4.11.3.4 AT&T-22STATE may use reasonable security measures to protect its equipment. In the event
AT&T-22STATE elects to erect an interior security partition in a given Eligible Structure to
separate its equipment, AT&T-22STATE may recover the costs of the partition in lieu of the
costs of other reasonable security measures if the partition costs are lower than the costs of any
other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. In no event shall a Collocator be
required to pay for both an interior security partition to separate AT&T-22STATE’s equipment in
an Eligible Structure and any other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. If
AT&T-22STATE elects to erect an interior security partition and recover the cost, it must
demonstrate to the Physical Collocator that other reasonable security methods cost more than
an interior security partition around AT&T-22STATE’s equipment at the time the price quote is
given.
4.11.3.4.1 AT&T-22STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own
equipment shall not interfere with a CLEC’s access to its equipment, including
equipment Collocated directly adjacent to AT&T-22STATE’s equipment. AT&T-
22STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own equipment
shall not impede a Telecommunications Carrier’s ability to Collocate within AT&T-
22STATE’s space. To the extent that AT&T-22STATE is required to install
additional security measures within its interior security partition because a CLEC

has access to its own equipment within the area, such security measures shall be
constructed and maintained at AT&T-22STATE’s expense.
4.11.3.4.2 AT&T-22STATE’s enclosure of its own equipment will not unreasonably increase a
CLEC’s cost nor shall it result in duplicative security costs. The cost of an interior
security partition around AT&T-22STATE’s equipment cannot include any
embedded costs of any other security measures for the Eligible Structure.
5.0 Collocation Space
5.1 Use of Collocation Space:
5.1.1 Nature of Use – Equipment Permitted to be Collocated
5.1.1.1 Equipment is considered necessary for Interconnection if an inability to deploy that equipment
would, as a practical, economic, or operations matter, preclude the Collocator from obtaining
Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE at a level equal in quality to that which AT&T-22STATE
obtains within its own network or AT&T-22STATE provides to an Affiliate, subsidiary, or other
Party.
5.1.1.2 Equipment is considered necessary for access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if an inability to deploy that
equipment would, as a practical, economic, or operational matter, preclude the Collocator from
obtaining non-discriminatory access to that 251(c)(3) UNE.
5.1.1.3 Examples of equipment that would not be considered necessary include, but are not limited to:
traditional circuit switching equipment, equipment used exclusively for call-related databases,
computer servers used exclusively for providing information services, OSS equipment used to
support collocated Telecommunications carrier network operations, equipment that generates
customer orders, manages trouble tickets or inventory, or stores customer records in centralized
databases, etc.
5.1.1.4 AT&T-22STATE will determine upon receipt of an application if the requested equipment is
necessary based on the criteria established by the FCC. In order to make this determination,
AT&T-22STATE may need to request additional information from Collocator. Collocator agrees
to use its best efforts to provide such information to AT&T-22STATE in a timely manner.
5.1.2 Multi-functional equipment shall be deemed necessary for Interconnection or access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if,
and only if, the primary purpose and function of the equipment (as the Collocator seeks to deploy it) meets
either or both of the standards set forth above in this Section. For a piece of multi-functional equipment to
be utilized primarily to obtain equal in quality Interconnection or non-discriminatory access to one or more
251(c)(3) UNEs, there also must be a logical connection or link between the additional functions the
equipment would perform and the Telecommunication Services the Collocator seeks to provide to its End
Users by means of the interconnection or 251(c)(3) UNE. The additional functions of the equipment that, as
stand-alone functions, do not meet either of the standards set forth above in this Section must not cause the
equipment to significantly increase the burden of AT&T-22STATE’s property.
5.2 Demarcation Point - AT&T-22STATE
5.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will designate the point(s) of demarcation between Collocator’s equipment and/or network
facilities and AT&T-22STATE’s network facilities. For DS0, DS1, DS3 and fiber terminations, AT&T-
22STATE shall designate, provide and install demarcation point hardware on a per arrangement basis.
Collocator shall utilize an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 to installing their interconnection cabling to the AT&T-
22STATE designated demarcation point .
5.2.2 The Physical Collocator or its AT&T-22STATE AIS, must install, maintain and operate the
equipment/facilities on its side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be
required within its own Collocation Space to activate service requests.
5.2.3 The Virtual Collocator via its AT&T-22STATE AIS must install and operate the equipment/facilities on its
side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be required within its own

Page 20 of 35
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
Collocation Space to activate service requests. AT&T-22STATE will maintain the Virtual Collocation
arrangement.
5.3 Types of Available Physical Collocation Arrangements:
5.3.1 AT&T-22STATE will make each of the arrangements outlined below available within its Eligible Structures in
accordance with this Attachment and the AT&T CLEC On-line Collocation Handbook so that Collocator will
have a variety of Collocation options from which to choose.
5.3.2 Caged Physical Collocation:
5.3.2.1 Caged Collocation option provides the Physical Collocator with an individual enclosure (not
including a top). This enclosure is an area designated by AT&T-22STATE within an Eligible
Structure to be used by the Physical Collocator for the sole purpose of installing, maintaining and
operating the Physical Collocator-provided equipment for the purpose of Interconnection under
section 251(c)(2) and access to 251(c)(3) UNEs. Accordingly, AT&T-22STATE will not provide
the Physical Collocator with direct access to AT&T-22STATE’s MDF, with the exception of the
AT&T-22STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.3.2.2 AT&T-22STATE will provide floor space, floor space site conditioning, cage common systems
materials, cage preparation, and safety and security charges in increments of one (1) square
foot. For this reason, the Physical Collocator will be able to order space and a cage enclosure in
amounts as small as that sufficient to house and maintain a single rack or bay of equipment
(minimum of fifty (50) square feet of caged space) and will ensure that the first Physical
Collocator in an AT&T-22STATE Premises will not be responsible for the entire cost of site
preparation and security.
5.3.2.3 At the Physical Collocator’s option, the Collocator may elect to install its own enclosure, but must
comply with all methods, procedures and guidelines followed by AT&T-22STATE in constructing
such an arrangement. The Physical Collocator may provide a cage enclosure (which shall not
include a top), cable rack and support structure inside the cage, lighting, receptacles, cage
grounding, cage sign and door key set. In addition, terms and conditions for contractors
performing cage construction activities as set forth following will apply.
5.3.3 Shared Caged Collocation:
5.3.3.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide Shared Caged Collocation as set forth in the AT&T CLEC Online
Handbook. Two (2) or more Physical Collocators may initially apply at the same time to share a
Caged Collocation space as set forth in 2.0 above. Charges to each Physical Collocator will be
based upon the percentage of total space utilized by each Physical Collocator.
5.3.4 Guest-Host Collocation (Also known as Sub-Lease Collocation):
5.3.4.1 The Physical Collocator may allow other Telecommunications Carriers to share the Physical
Collocator’s caged Collocation space, pursuant to the terms and conditions agreed to by the
Physical Collocator (Host) and the other Telecommunication Carriers (Guests) which must be
consistent with the provisions contained in this Section and this Agreement, except where the
AT&T-22STATE Premises is located within a leased space and AT&T-22STATE is prohibited by
said lease from offering such an option to the Physical Collocator. AT&T-22STATE shall be
notified in writing by the Physical Collocator upon the execution of any agreement between the
Host and its Guest(s) prior to the submission of an application. Further, such notification shall
include the name of the Guest(s), the term of the agreement, and a certification by the Physical
Collocator that said agreement imposes upon the Guest(s) the same terms and conditions for
Collocation space as set forth in this Attachment between AT&T-22STATE and the Physical
Collocator. The term of the agreement between the Host and its Guest(s) shall not exceed the
term of this Agreement between AT&T-22STATE and the Physical Collocator.

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
5.3.4.2 The Physical Collocator, as the Host, shall be the sole interface and the responsible Party to
AT&T-22STATE for the assessment and billing of rates and charges contained within this
Attachment and for the purposes of ensuring that the safety and security requirements of this
Attachment are fully complied with by the Guest(s), the Guest(s) employees and agents. There
will be a minimum charge of one (1) bay/rack per Host/Guest. In addition to the above, the
Physical Collocator shall be the responsible Party to AT&T-22STATE for the purpose of
submitting applications for initial and additional equipment placement for the Guest(s).
5.3.4.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guest(s) may submit service orders to AT&T-22STATE to
request the provisioning of interconnecting facilities between AT&T-22STATE and the Guest(s),
the provisioning of services, and/or access to Section 251(c)(3) UNEs. The bill for these
interconnecting facilities, services and Section 251(c)(3) UNEs will be charged to the Guest(s)
pursuant to the applicable the Guest’s Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
5.3.5 Cageless Collocation:
5.3.5.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide cageless Collocation in any Collocation space that is supported by
the existing Telecommunications infrastructure. AT&T-22STATE will provide space in single bay
increments, including available space adjacent to or next to AT&T-22STATE’s equipment as
needed.
5.3.5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall allow the Physical Collocator to collocate the Physical Collocator’s
equipment and facilities without requiring the construction of a cage or similar structure.
5.3.5.3 Except where the Physical Collocator’s equipment requires special technical considerations
(e.g., special cable racking or isolated ground plane), AT&T-22STATE shall assign cageless
Collocation arrangement in conventional equipment rack lineups where feasible. For equipment
requiring special technical considerations, the Physical Collocator must provide the equipment
layout, including spatial dimensions for such equipment pursuant to generic requirements
contained in TP-76200, and shall be responsible for compliance with all special technical
requirements associated with such equipment.
5.4 Adjacent On-Site Collocation:
5.4.1 Where Physical Collocation space within the AT&T-22STATE CO is Legitimately Exhausted AT&T-
22STATE will permit the Physical Collocator to Physically Collocate on AT&T-22STATE’s property in the
Physical Collocator’s adjacent structures similar to structures that AT&T-22STATE uses to house
Telecommunication Equipment, to the extent Technically Feasible.
5.4.2 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC will mutually agree on the location of the designated space on AT&T-22STATE
premises where the Adjacent Structure will be placed. AT&T-22STATE will not unreasonably withhold
agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator. Safety and maintenance requirements, zoning,
future building expansion and other state and local regulations are all examples of reasonable grounds to
withhold agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator.
5.4.3 AT&T-22STATE will offer the following increments of power to the Adjacent Structure:
5.4.3.1 a standard offering of one-hundred (100) amps of AC power to the Adjacent Structure when CO
Switchboard AC capacity exists or
5.4.3.2 DC power within two (2) cable options that allow increments of 2-100 (100A feed and 100B feed)
Amp Power Feeds, 2-200 (200A feed and 200B feed) Amp Power Feeds, 2-300 (300A feed and
300B feed) Amp Power Feeds, and 2-400 (400A feed and 400B feed) Amp Power Feeds to the
Adjacent Structure from the CO Power source.
5.4.4 At its option, the Physical Collocator may choose to provide its own AC and DC power to the Adjacent
Structure.
5.4.5 AT&T-22STATE will provide Physical Collocation services to such Adjacent Structures, subject to the same
requirements as other Collocation arrangements in this Attachment.

Page 22 of 35
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
5.4.6 AT&T-22STATE shall permit the Physical Collocator to place its own equipment, including, but not limited
to, copper cables, coaxial cables, fiber cables and Telecommunications Equipment, in adjacent facilities
constructed by the Physical Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE AIS. Accordingly, AT&T-22STATE will not
provide the Physical Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-22STATE’s MDF, with the
exception of the AT&T-22STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.4.7 The Physical Collocator shall be responsible for securing all required licenses and permits, the required site
preparations and shall further retain responsibility for securing and/or constructing the Adjacent Structure
and any building and site maintenance associated with the placement of such Adjacent Structure.
5.4.8 Regeneration is required for Collocation in an Adjacent Structure if the cabling distance between the
Physical Collocator’s POT bay or termination point located in an Adjacent Structure and AT&T-22STATE’s
cross-connect bay exceeds American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) limitations. Regeneration is
not required in any other circumstances except where the Physical Collocator specifically requests
regeneration. Required regeneration and Physical Collocator requested regeneration will be provided at the
Physical Collocator’s expense.
5.4.9 In the event that interior space in an Eligible Structure becomes available, AT&T-22STATE will provide the
option to the Physical Collocator to relocate its equipment from an Adjacent on-site facility into the interior
space. In the event the Physical Collocator chooses to relocate its equipment into the interior space,
appropriate charges applicable for Collocation within the Eligible Structure will apply.
5.4.10 If a Physical Collocator elects to provide an Adjacent On-Site Space Collocation as described above, when
all available space for Physical Collocation is Legitimately Exhausted inside an AT&T-22STATE Eligible
Structure, AT&T-22STATE will charge Planning Fees to recover the costs incurred to estimate the quotation
of charges for the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site Collocation arrangement request. Rates and charges are
found in the Pricing Schedule. In addition, should the Collocator elect to have AT&T-22STATE provision an
extension of DC Power Service from the Eligible Structure to the Adjacent Structure, a Collocator
Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) will be required.
5.4.11 Adjacent On-site Planning Fee
5.4.11.1 An initial Planning Fee will apply when a Collocator is requesting any Interconnection
Terminations between the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure and AT&T-22STATE on an
initial or subsequent Adjacent On-site collocation application. This fee recovers the design route
of the Interconnection Terminations as well as the design route of the power arrangement to the
Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure.
5.5 Virtual Collocation:
5.5.1 Virtual Collocation for the purpose of Interconnection under section 251(c)(2) to AT&T-22STATE or access
to AT&T-22STATE provided 251(c)(3) UNEs is ordered as set forth in AT&T-22-STATE’s Interconnector's
Collocation Services Handbook for Virtual Collocation. AT&T-22STATE will designate the location or
locations within its wire centers, CEVs, huts and cabinets for the placement of all equipment and facilities
associated with Virtual Collocation. Virtual Collocation does not involve the reservation of segregated CO or
CEV, hut and Cabinet space for the use of Virtual Collocator. AT&T-22STATE will provide Virtual
Collocation for the Virtual Collocator’s comparable equipment as it provides to itself in the CO, wire center,
CEV, hut or Cabinet, as the case may be, subject to the requirements of this Agreement.
6.0 Reports
6.1 Space Availability Report:
6.1.1 CLEC may request a space availability report prior to its application for Collocation space within AT&T-
22STATE’s Eligible Structures. This report will specify the amount of Collocation space available at each
requested Eligible Structure, the number of Collocators, and any modifications in the use of the space since
the last report. The report will also include measures that AT&T-22STATE is taking to make additional
space available for Collocation. CLEC may access the appropriate form for the space availability report on
PPaaggee 222212 ooff 453332 CCCS 221 of 424

Page 223 of 430 Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 23 of 35
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
the AT&T CLEC Online website. A space availability report does not reserve space at the AT&T-22STATE
Premises for which the space availability report was requested by CLEC.
6.1.2 Fees for such reports are shown in the Pricing Schedule.
7.0 Application Process
7.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide Collocation arrangements in Eligible Structures on a “first-come, first-served” basis. To
apply for a Dedicated Space in a particular Eligible Structure CLEC and AT&T-22STATE will follow the Collocation
Application (“Application”) process in the AT&T-22STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook at the
AT&T CLEC Online website. The Collocator will provide a completed Application through the Collocation Application
Web Portal via AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC Online website and will pay AT&T-22STATE an initial Planning/Application
Fee as found in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.1 Application for Multiple Methods of Collocation:
7.1.1.1 A Collocator wishing AT&T-22STATE to consider multiple methods for Collocation in an Eligible
Structure on a single Application will need to include in each Application a prioritized list of its
preferred methods of collocating, e.g., caged, cageless, or other, as well as adequate
information, (e.g., specific layout requirements, cage size, number of bays, requirements relative
to adjacent bays, etc.) for AT&T-22STATE to process the Application for each of the preferred
methods. If a Collocator provides adequate information and its preferences with its Application,
AT&T-22STATE would not require an additional Application, nor would the Collocator be
required to restart the quotation interval should its first choice not be available in an Eligible
Structure.
7.2 Complete and Accurate Application Review Process:
7.2.1 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and initial Planning/Application Fee
payment, AT&T-22STATE will begin development of the quotation.
7.2.2 In responding to an Application request, if space and interconnection facilities are available and all other
Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-22STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request for space is
granted, confirm the applicable NRC and MRC rates and the estimated provisioning interval. AT&T-
22STATE will not select for Collocator the type of Collocation to be ordered.
7.2.3 All applicable NRCs are required to be paid to AT&T-22STATE prior to the Collocation space being turned
over to the Collocator. AT&T-13STATE processes the payment of the aforementioned NRCs in two
installments: 50% of the applicable NRCs are due upon the Collocator’s deliverance of the signed BFFO to
AT&T-13STATE with the remaining 50% payment due two weeks prior to the Collocation space turnover.
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will issue a bill for all applicable NRCs to the Collocator’s after the
Collocator’s deliverance of the signed BFFO.
7.3 Space Unavailability Determination and Resolution:
7.3.1 In responding to an Application request if space is not available, AT&T-22STATE will notify the Collocator
that its application for Collocation Space is denied due to the lack of space and no Application fee shall
apply. If AT&T-22STATE knows when additional Collocation space may become available at the AT&T-
22STATE CO requested by Collocator such information will be provided to Collocator in AT&T-22-STATE’s
written denial of Collocation Space. AT&T-22STATE in its denial will provide the Collocator with any other
known methods of Collocation that may be available within the Eligible Structure that the Collocator’s
Application addressed. If the Collocator determines the alternative method of collocation meets their needs,
the Collocator will be required to submit a new collocation application and pay the initial Planning Fee.
7.3.2 The notification will include a possible future space relief date, if applicable. At that time, any non-recurring
charges collected with the Application, including the Planning Fee, will be returned to the Collocator. When
AT&T-22STATE’s response includes an amount of space less than that requested by Collocator or space
that is configured differently, no Application fee will apply. If Collocator decides to accept the available
space, Collocator must resubmit its Application to reflect the actual space available including the
PPaaggee 222223 ooff 453332 CCCS 222 of 424

Page 224 of 430 Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 24 of 35
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
reconfiguration of the space. When Collocator resubmits its Application to accept the available space,
AT&T-22STATE will bill the applicable Application/ Planning fee.
7.3.3 In the event of a denial, AT&T-22STATE will file a notice that the Collocator’s request was denied with the
Commission. When contested in support of its denial, AT&T-22STATE will concurrently submit to both the
Commission and the Collocator, provided under seal and subject to proprietary protections, the following
when applicable:
7.3.3.1 central office common language location identifier (CLLI),
7.3.3.2 the identity of the requesting Collocator,
7.3.3.3 amount of space requested by the Collocator
7.3.3.4 the total amount of space at the AT&T-22STATE premises
7.3.3.5 floor plan documentation (as provided for in the Space Availability Determination section of the
Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook)
7.3.3.6 identification of switch turnaround plans and other equipment removal plans and timelines, if any,
7.3.3.7 CO rearrangement/expansion plans, if any,
7.3.3.8 and description of other plans, if any, that may relieve space exhaustion.
7.3.4 In the event AT&T-22STATE denies a Collocator’s request and the Collocator disputes the denial, the
Collocator may request a tour of the Eligible Structure to verify space availability or the lack thereof. The
request shall be submitted to AT&T-22STATE’s designated representative in writing. Time limits
established by the FCC must be respected. The inspection tour shall be scheduled as mutually agreeable.
7.3.5 Prior to the inspection tour, a “Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement” shall be signed by the designated
AT&T-22STATE representative and the representative the Collocator, who will participate in the tour.
7.3.6 AT&T-22STATE will provide all relevant documentation to the Collocator including blueprints and plans for
future facility expansions or enhancements, subject to executing the Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement.
AT&T-22STATE’s representative will accompany and supervise the Collocator agent on the inspection tour.
7.3.7 If the Collocator believes, based on the inspection tour of the Eligible Structure facilities, that the denial of
Physical Collocation space is unsupportable, the Collocator agent shall promptly so advise AT&T-
22STATE. The Collocator and AT&T-22STATE shall then each concurrently prepare a report detailing its
own findings of the inspection tour. The Collocator and AT&T-22STATE reports shall be concurrently
served on each other and submitted to the Commission no later than forty-five (45) calendar days following
the filing of the request for space. The burden of proof shall be on AT&T-22STATE to justify the basis for
any denial of collocation requests.
7.4 Revisions:
7.4.1 If a modification or revision is made to any information in the Application after AT&T-22STATE has provided
the Application response and prior to a BFFO, with the exception of modifications to (1) Customer
Information, (2) Contact Information or (3) Billing Contact Information, whether at the request of Collocator
or as necessitated by technical considerations, the Application shall be considered a new Application and
handled as a new Application with respect to the response and provisioning intervals. AT&T-22STATE will
charge Collocator the appropriate Application/Augment fee associated with the level of assessment
performed by AT&T-22STATE.
7.4.2 Once AT&T-22STATE has provided the BFFO/quote and CLEC has accepted and authorized AT&T-
22STATE to begin construction, any further modifications and/or revisions must be made via a subsequent

7.5.1 A request from a Collocator to add or modify space, equipment, and/or cable to an existing Collocation
arrangement is considered an Augment. Such a request must be made via a complete and accurate
Application.
7.5.2 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and Planning Fee payment, AT&T-
22STATE will begin development of the Augment quotation. In responding to an Augment request, if power
and/or Interconnection facilities are available and all other Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-
22STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request is granted, confirm the applicable non-recurring and
recurring rates and the estimated provisioning interval.
7.5.3 Several types of Augments are identified in the Collocation section of the AT&T CLEC Online website.
Those Augments will have associated pricing within the Pricing Schedule. Examples are:
7.5.3.1 100 Copper cable pair connections
7.5.3.2 28 DS1 connections and/or
7.5.3.3 1 DS3 connections and/or
7.5.3.4 24 fiber connections
7.6 For all Augments other than provided above, AT&T-22STATE will work cooperatively with Collocator to negotiate a
mutually agreeable delivery interval. All intervals and procedures associated with Augment Applications can be
found in AT&T-22STATE’s Interconnector's Collocation Services Handbook at the AT&T CLEC Online website.
7.7 Intervals for Interconnection & Power Cabling:
7.7.1 CLEC shall consult the AT&T CLEC On-Line Handbook for information regarding interval changes regarding
Interconnection to and /or Power Cabling changes. CLEC must use an AT&T-22STATE AIS to establish
Interconnection and/or Power cabling as outlined in the appropriate TP.
8.0 Augment Application
8.1 In the event Collocator or the Physical Collocator’s Guest(s) desires to modify its use of the Collocation space in a
CO after a BFFO, Collocator shall complete a new Application that contains all of the detailed information associated
with a requested alteration of the Collocation space. The subsequent Application will be processed by AT&T-
22STATE when it is complete and accurate, meaning that all of the required fields on the Subsequent Application
have been completed with the appropriate type of information associated with the requested alteration. AT&T-
22STATE shall determine what modifications, if any, to the AT&T-22STATE Premises are required to accommodate
the change(s) requested by Collocator in the subsequent Application. Such modifications to the AT&T-22STATE
Premises may include, but are not limited to, floor loading changes, changes necessary to meet HVAC requirements,
changes to power plant requirements, equipment additions, etc.
9.0 Cancellation Prior to Due Date
9.1 In the event that the Collocator cancels its Collocation Application after AT&T-22STATE has begun preparation of
the Telecommunications Infrastructure Space and Dedicated Space, but before AT&T-22STATE has been paid the
entire amounts due under this Attachment, then in addition to other remedies that AT&T-22STATE might have, the
Collocator shall be liable in the amount equal to the non-recoverable costs less estimated net salvage, the total of
which is not to exceed the Preparation Charges. Non-recoverable costs include the non-recoverable cost of
equipment and material ordered, provided or used; the non-recoverable cost of installation and removal, including the
costs of equipment and material ordered, provided or used; labor; transportation and any other associated costs.
Upon Collocator’s request, AT&T-22STATE will provide the Collocator with a detailed invoice showing the costs it
incurred associated with preparation.
10.0 Occupancy – Physical Collocation Only
10.1 Unless there are unusual circumstances, AT&T-22STATE will notify the Physical Collocator that the Dedicated
Space is ready for occupancy after AT&T-22STATE’s completion of preparation of the Dedicated Space. All MRCs
and NRCs will begin to accrue on the date that the Collocation space construction had been completed by AT&T-

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
22STATE (“Space Ready Date”), regardless of any failure by the Physical Collocator to complete its work or occupy
the space.
10.2 After the Physical Collocator’s receipt of such notice, the Physical Collocator shall request within fifteen (15) calendar
days an acceptance walk-through of the Collocation space with AT&T-22STATE. The acceptance walk-through will
be scheduled on a mutually agreed upon date. Any material deviations from mutually agreed Application
specifications may be noted by the Physical Collocator as exceptions, which to qualify as exceptions, must be agreed
to as exceptions by AT&T-22STATE. The agreed upon exceptions shall be corrected by AT&T-22STATE by a
mutually agreed upon date. The correction of these exceptions shall be at AT&T-22STATE’s expense. AT&T-
22STATE will then establish a new Space Ready Date.
10.3 Upon completion of corrections described in Section 10.2, AT&T-22STATE will again notify the Physical Collocator
that the Dedicated Space is ready for occupancy and the Parties will, upon Collocator’s request, conduct a follow-up
acceptance walk-through as set forth in this Section. This follow-up acceptance walkthrough will be limited to only
those corrections identified and agreed to by the Parties in the initial walkthrough, as described in Section 10.2
above. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is not requested by the Physical Collocator within 15 calendar days,
the Space Ready Date shall be deemed to be the Delivery Date. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is
requested, but no continuing material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date of the follow-up acceptance walk-through. If a follow-up acceptance
walk-through is requested, and material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date upon which the Physical Collocator accepts all corrections to such
exceptions, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.4 All charges to the Physical Collocator will begin to accrue on the Effective Billing Date, regardless of any failure by
Collocator to complete its work or occupy the space. In the case of the termination of this Agreement prior to term, or
the early termination of any Collocation services, AT&T-22STATE shall be entitled to full payment within thirty (30)
calendar days of such expiration or termination for all services performed and expenses accrued or incurred that
AT&T-22STATE is entitled to recover under the provisions of this Attachment for establishing such Collocation
arrangement prior to such expiration or termination.
10.5 If the Physical Collocator cancels or abandons its Collocation space in any of AT&T-22STATE COs before AT&T-
22STATE has recovered the full cost associated with providing that space to the Physical Collocator, the amount of
any such remaining costs shall become immediately due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Physical Collocator abandons that space.
10.6 The Physical Collocator shall notify AT&T-22STATE in writing that its Collocation equipment installation is complete.
For purposes of this Section, the Collocator’s Telecommunications Equipment is considered to be operational and
Interconnected when it is connected to either AT&T-22STATE’s network or interconnected to another Third Party
Collocator’s equipment that resides within the same structure, provided the Third Party Collocator’s equipment is
used for Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE’s network or to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs.
For the purpose of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE may refuse to accept any orders for cross-connects until it has
received such notice from Physical the Collocator.
10.7 Early Space Acceptance:
10.7.1 If Physical Collocator decides to occupy the Collocation space prior to the Space Ready Date, the date
Physical Collocator executes the Agreement for “Customer Access and Acceptance to Unfinished
Collocation Space” is the date that will be deemed the space acceptance date and billing will begin from that
date.
10.7.2 The Physical Collocator will, whenever possible, place its Telecommunications Equipment in the Collocation
space within thirty (30) calendar days of space turnover. Operational Telecommunications Equipment must
be placed in the Dedicated Space and interconnected to AT&T-22STATE’s network pursuant to Section
251(c)(2) or used to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs within one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after receipt of Notice that AT&T-22STATE has completed its work as required by the
complete and accurate Collocation Application.

10.8 Reclamation of Dedicated Space:
10.8.1 If the Physical Collocator fails to place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space
to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs meeting all the
requirements of Section 5.1 above and 10.7 above and the space is needed to meet customer demand
(filed application for space, accompanied by all fees) for another Collocator or to avoid construction of a
building addition, then AT&T-22STATE has the right to reclaim the Dedicated Space. AT&T-22STATE will
send the Physical Collocator written Notice of its intent to terminate the Physical Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement in the prepared Dedicated Space within ten (10) Business Days after the notice date. If the
Physical Collocator does not place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space and
interconnect with AT&T-22STATE or obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs by that tenth (10th)
Business Day then the Collocation is deemed terminated and the Physical Collocator shall be liable in an
amount equal to the unpaid balance of the applicable charges.
10.8.2 If the Physical Collocator causes AT&T-22STATE to prepare the Dedicated Space and then the Physical
Collocator does not use the Dedicated Space (or all of the Dedicated Space), the Physical Collocator will
pay AT&T-22STATE the monthly recurring and other applicable charges as if the Physical Collocator were
using the entire Dedicated Space, until such time as the Physical Collocator submits a complete and
accurate decommissioning Application, and the decommissioning process is completed as required.
11.0 Efficiently Used
11.1 Orders for additional space will not be accepted until the Collocator’s existing Collocation space in the requested
Eligible Structure is Efficiently Used (as defined in Section 2 this Attachment) except to the extent the Collocator
establishes to AT&T-22STATE’s satisfaction that the Collocator's apparent inefficient use of space is caused by the
CLEC holding Unused Space for future use on the same basis that AT&T-22STATE holds Unused Space for future
use.
11.2 Orders for additional CFAs will not be accepted until the specific CFA type requested (e.g. DS0, DS1, fiber, etc.) in
the requested Eligible Structure is Efficiently Used. The determination as to whether this criterion is met or
necessary is solely within the reasonable judgment of AT&T-22STATE.
12.0 Relocation
12.1 AT&T-22STATE Requested Relocation:
12.1.1 When AT&T-22STATE determines, in order to be compliant with zoning changes, condemnation, or
government order or regulation, that it is necessary for the Dedicated Space to be moved, AT&T-22STATE
will provide written notice to the resident Collocator(s) within five (5) Business Days of the determination to
move the location. Such a determination may affect movement from an Eligible Structure to another Eligible
Structure, or from an Adjacent Space Collocation structure to a different Adjacent Space Collocation
structure or and Adjacent Space Collocation structure to an Eligible Structure.
12.1.2 If the relocation occurs for reasons other than an emergency, AT&T-22STATE will provide the resident
Collocator(s) with at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days advance written Notice prior to the
relocation.
12.1.3 An Application will be required by the Collocator for the arrangement of the new Dedicated Space and/or the
new Telecommunications Equipment Space . The Collocator will not be required to pay any Application
fees associated with the relocation described in this Section 12.1.
12.1.4 The Collocator shall be responsible for the costs for the preparation of the new Telecommunications
Equipment Space and Dedicated Space at the new location or an adjacent space Collocation structure if
such relocation arises from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of AT&T-22STATE, including
zoning changes, condemnation or government order or regulation that makes the continued occupancy or
use of the Dedicated Space or the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located or the adjacent
space Collocation structure for the purpose then used, uneconomical in AT&T-22STATE’s reasonable
discretion.

13.2 Space Reassignment also known as Transfer of Ownership:
13.2.1 In lieu of submitting an Application to terminate a Collocation Arrangement, as described above, the
Collocator (“Exiting Collocator”) may reassign the Collocation Arrangement to another Collocator
(“Collocator Assignee”) subject to certain terms and conditions outlined below. Any such reassignment of
the Collocation Arrangement may not occur without the written consent of AT&T-22STATE. In order to
request consent to assign a Collocation Arrangement, either the Collocator Assignee or Exiting Collocator
must submit a Collocation Application on behalf of both the Exiting Collocator and Collocator Assignee.
Space Reassignment shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
13.2.1.1 Collocator Assignee must, as of the date of submission of the Collocation Application, have an
approved Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
13.2.1.2 Exiting Collocator will be liable to pay all NRCs and MRCs Collocation charges on the
Collocation Arrangement to be reassigned until the date AT&T-22STATE turns over the
Collocation Arrangement to the Collocator Assignee. Any disputed charges shall be subject to
the Dispute Resolution Process in the GT&Cs of this Agreement. AT&T-22STATE’s obligation
to turn over the Collocation Arrangement shall not arise until all undisputed charges are paid.
Collocator Assignee’s obligation to pay MRCs for a Collocation Arrangement will begin on the
date AT&T-22STATE makes available the Collocation Arrangement to the Collocator Assignee.
13.2.1.3 An Exiting Collocator may not reassign Collocation space in an Eligible Structure where a waiting
list exists for Collocation space, unless all Collocator’s on the waiting list above the Collocator
Assignee decline their position. This prohibition does not apply in the case of an acquisition,
merger or complete purchase of the Exiting Collocator’s assets.
13.2.1.4 Collocator Assignee will defend and indemnify AT&T-22STATE from any losses, costs (including
court costs), claims, damages (including fines, penalties, and criminal or civil judgments and

entity or regulatory authority challenges the reassignment of any Collocation Arrangement(s) or
otherwise claims a right to the space subject to the reassignment.
13.2.2 Collocator Assignee or the Exiting Collocator shall submit one (1) complete and accurate Application for
each Collocation Arrangement. The Exiting Collocator must ensure that the Collocator Assignee complies
with the following: Collocator Assignee submits a complete and accurate Application for a Collocation
Arrangement, Collocator Assignee represents warrants and agrees that it has obtained an executed sale or
lease agreement for and holds proper title to all non-AT&T-22STATE equipment and other items in or
otherwise associated with each Collocation Arrangement. Collocator Assignee further agrees to indemnify
and hold AT&T-22STATE harmless from any Third Party claims involving allegations that Collocator
Assignee does not hold proper title to such non-AT&T-22STATE equipment and other items.
13.2.3 AT&T-22STATE in its response to the Application will provide a price quote. Collocator Assignee must pay
one-hundred percent (100%) of all NRCs in the price quote before AT&T-22STATE begins to convert the
Collocation Arrangement being reassigned. Once Collocator Assignee has paid one-hundred percent
(100%) of all such NRCs, AT&T-22STATE shall finish the work to convert the space within thirty (30)
calendar days. AT&T-22STATE and Collocator Assignee will coordinate all conversion work to ensure that
the End Users of Collocator Assignee will have minimal, if any, disruption of service during such conversion.
13.2.4 Collocator Assignee may submit a security application for access to a Collocation Arrangement
simultaneously with the Collocation Application. If a completed security application is provided at the time
the Collocation Application is filed, the security cards will be made available at the time that the Collocation
space is turned over. If the security application is not provided at the time that the Collocation Application is
filed, then Collocator Assignee may submit a security application for access at any time and the terms and
conditions as provided in Section 4.11 above will apply. In no event will the security cards be provided to
the Collocator Assignee before the assigned space is turned over.
13.2.5 Collocator Assignee assumes each Collocation Arrangement “as is” which means that AT&T-22STATE will
make no changes to the Collocation Arrangement, including no changes to power, interconnection and
entrance facilities. Any modifications to such Collocation Arrangement by Collocator Assignee must be
submitted via a separate augment Application (as provided by the Collocator Assignee’s ICA).
13.3 Interconnection Termination Reduction:
13.3.1 The Collocator may request a reduction of the existing amount of Interconnection terminations that service a
Collocation Arrangement. The Collocator shall submit an augment Application in order to process this
request. The Collocator must maintain at least one minimum Interconnection arrangement.
13.3.2 Interconnection termination reduction requests may require the disconnection and removal of
interconnection cable. AT&T-22STATE will perform the interconnection cable removal work above the rack
level at the applicable fees referenced in the Pricing Schedule. Within thirty (30) calendar days after
submitting its interconnection termination reduction request to disconnect and remove an interconnection
arrangement from its Collocation Arrangement, the Collocator must remove terminations at both ends of the
interconnection cable and cut and cap cables up to the AT&T-22STATE rack level. Collocator must use the
AT&T-22STATE AIS for this procedure and AT&T-22STATE AIS must follow the appropriate TP found on

entrance cable from the cable vault to the Physical Collocation Dedicated Space.
14.1.2.2 For a Virtual Collocation arrangement AT&T-22STATE will splice the Collocator provided
entrance fiber to an AT&T-22STATE fiber cable terminated on AT&T-22STATE’s Fiber
distribution frame.
14.2 If the Collocator has not left the cable in the manhole within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the request
for entrance fiber, the Collocator’s request for entrance fiber will expire and a new Application must be submitted
along with applicable fees. The Collocator may request an additional thirty (30) calendar day extension by notifying
AT&T-22STATE, no later than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the end of the 120 calendar day period mentioned
above, of the need of the extension for the Collocator to place cable at the manhole.
14.3 The Collocator shall use a dielectric Optical Fiber Non-conductive Riser-rated (OFNR) fiber cable as the transmission
medium to the Dedicated Space for Physical or to the AT&T-22STATE designated splice point for Virtual. In
addition, AT&T-22STATE requires this fiber to be yellow or black with yellow striped sheath.
14.4 The Collocator, where not impractical for technical reasons and where space is available, may use Microwave
Entrance Facility Collocation pursuant to the Microwave Attachment.
14.5 Copper or coaxial cable will only be permitted to be utilized as the transmission medium where the Collocator can
demonstrate to AT&T-22STATE or the Commission that use of such cable will not impair AT&T-22STATE’s ability to
service its own End Users or subsequent Collocators. Collocation requests utilizing copper or coaxial cable facilities
will be provided as an Individual Case Basis (ICB).
14.6 AT&T-22STATE shall provide a minimum of two separate points of entry into the Eligible Structure, where AT&T-
22STATE has at least two such entry points, there is sufficient space for new facilities in those entry points, and it is
Technically Feasible.. Where such dual points of entry are not available, when AT&T-22STATE performs work as is
necessary to make available such separate points of entry for itself, at the same time it will accommodate the
Collocator’s request under this Section. The Collocator and AT&T-22STATE shall share the costs incurred by
prorating those costs using the number of cables to be placed in the entry point by both AT&T-22STATE and the
Collocator(s).
14.7 AT&T-22STATE will also provide nondiscriminatory access where Technically Feasible and sufficient space exists,
to any entry point into Eligible Structures in excess of two (2) points in those locations where AT&T-22STATE also
has access to more than two such entry points. Where AT&T-22STATE performs such work in order to
accommodate its own needs and those specified in the Collocator’s written request, the Collocator and AT&T-
22STATE shall share the costs incurred by prorating those costs using the number of cables to be placed in the entry
point by both AT&T-22STATE and the Collocator(s).
15.0 Entrance Facility Conduit to Vault, Per Cable Sheath
15.1 This facility represents any reinforced passage or opening in, on, under, over or through the ground between the first
manhole and the cable vault through which the entrance cable is placed. Associated rates and charges can be found

18.0 Extraordinary Charges, Special Construction and Custom Work / ICB Charges
18.1 Extraordinary Charges - Collocator will be responsible for all extraordinary construction costs, incurred by AT&T-
22STATE to prepare the Collocation space for the installation of Collocator’s equipment and for extraordinary costs
to maintain the Collocation space for Collocator’s equipment on a going-forward basis. Extraordinary costs may
include costs for such items as asbestos removal, fire suppression system or containment, modifications or
expansion of cable entry facility, increasing the DC power system infrastructure capacity, increasing the capacity of
the AC system (if available), or of the existing commercial power facility, installation, maintenance, repair, monitoring
of securing measures, conversion of non-Collocation space, or other modifications required by local ordinances.
Ordinary costs may become extraordinary by their unusual nature (e.g. volume that is substantially beyond the
average or typical Collocation arrangement or request) or its infrequency of occurrence (e.g. construction that will
benefit only the requesting Collocator).
18.1.1 AT&T-22STATE may charge a recurring and a non-recurring fee for extraordinary costs on a time-sensitive
or time-and-materials basis.
18.1.2 An estimate of such costs plus contribution will be provided to the Collocator prior to AT&T-22STATE
commencing such work.
18.1.3 AT&T-22STATE must advise Collocator if extraordinary costs will be incurred within twenty (20) Business
Days of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application.
18.1.4 Extraordinary costs will only be billed upon receipt of the signed acceptance of AT&T-22STATE’s price
quote. Construction will not begin until receipt of the Collocator’s signed acceptance.
18.1.5 Special Construction and/or Custom work may not be charged to Collocator for any work performed which
will benefit or be used by AT&T-22STATE or other Collocators except on a pro-rated basis where
reasonable.
19.0 DC Power Arrangement Provisioning and Power Reduction
19.1 In a CO AT&T-22STATE shall make available -48V DC power to serve the Collocator’s equipment. When obtaining
DC power from an AT&T-22STATE Power Source (BDFB or Power Plant), Collocator’s fuses and power cables (for
the A & B feeds) must be engineered (sized), and installed by Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1, in accordance
with the number of DC amps requested by Collocator on Collocator’s Initial Application or any Subsequent
Applications. Collocator is also responsible for contracting with an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 to run the power
distribution feeder cable from the AT&T-22STATE Power Source to the equipment in Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement. The AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 contracted by Collocator must provide AT&T-22STATE with a copy of
the engineering power specifications prior to the day on which Collocator’s equipment becomes operational
(hereinafter “Commencement Date”). AT&T-22STATE will provide the common power feeder cable support
structure between the AT&T Power Source and Collocator’s Collocation arrangement. Collocator shall contract with
an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 who shall be responsible for performing those power provisioning activities required to
enable Collocator’s equipment to become operational, which may include, but are not limited to, the installation,
removal or replacement of the following: dedicated power cable support structure within Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement, power cable feeds and terminations of the power cabling. Collocator and Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
AIS Tier 1 shall comply with all applicable NEC, AT&T TP-76300, Telcordia and ANSI Standards that address power
cabling, installation and maintenance.
19.2 AT&T-22STATE will permit Collocator to request DC power in five (5) amp increments from five (5) amps up to forty
(40) amps. Above forty amps, DC power will be provisioned in ten (10) amp increments up to one hundred (100)
amps from the AT&T-22STATE Power source.
19.3 Collocator Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) – (Options):
19.3.1 A Collocator Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) with maximum 200 amp capacity may be ordered from
AT&T-22STATE or an equivalent panel provided by the Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1. At least
one (1) DC power panel is required with each application requiring DC Power when designed to provide
between 50 and 200 amps per feed of DC current. However the Collocator may substitute the required
power panel with an equivalent power panel subject to meeting NEBS Level 1 Safety and review by AT&T-
22STATE technical support. See the Collocation Handbook for additional information.
19.4 Eligible Structure Ground Cable Arrangement, Each:
19.4.1 The ground cable arrangement is the cabling arrangement designed to provide grounding for equipment
within the Collocator’s Dedicated Space. Separate Ground Cable Arrangements are required for Integrated
and Isolated Ground Planes. AT&T-22STATE provides an Integrated Ground Plane to serve the
Collocator’s equipment in the same manner as AT&T-22STATE equipment. Requests for an “Isolated”
Ground Plane will be treated on an ICB basis.
19.5 Power Reduction:
19.5.1 The Collocator may request to decrease the amount of existing power available to a Collocation
Arrangement. This can be done either by disconnecting and removing a power cable feed or by replacing
the existing fuse with a fuse of a lower breakdown rating on a power cable feed. If the Collocator desires to
disconnect a power arrangement (A&B feed), the Collocator will be responsible for hiring an AT&T-
22STATE AIS Tier 1 to remove the terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to
the AT&T-22STATE rack level that make up the power arrangement. If the Collocator desires to reduce the
amperage on a power cable feed, the Collocator will be responsible for paying the costs necessary to
change the fuse that serves the A&B feeds at the AT&T-22STATE power source. In either case, the
Collocator must maintain a minimum amount of power on at least one power arrangement (A&B feed) to
service their Collocation Arrangement when submitting their power reduction request. The Collocator shall
submit an augment application in order to process this request.
19.5.2 If the Collocator desires to only reduce the fuse capacity on an existing power arrangement (A&B feed)
rather than disconnect and remove cable to an existing power arrangement, they may only reduce the fuse
size to the lowest power amp increment offered in this Attachment referenced in 19.2 above. Different
minimum amp increments apply for power arrangements fed from either an AT&T-22STATE BDFB or an
AT&T-22STATE power plant. When the Collocator is requesting to reduce the fuse capacity only, the fees
referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply. When the Collocator has only one power arrangement (A&B
feed) serving their Collocation Arrangement, a fuse reduction is the only power reduction option available to
the Collocator.
19.5.3 When a power reduction request involves a fuse change only on a power arrangement serviced from the
AT&T-22STATE BDFB (e.g. power arrangements less than or equal to a fifty (50) amp A feed and a fifty
50) amp B feed) the Collocator must hire an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 to coordinate fuse changes at the
AT&T-22STATE BDFB. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule will still apply. When a power
reduction request involves a fuse change on a power arrangement serviced from the AT&T-22STATE
Power Plant (e.g. power arrangements consisting of a one-hundred (100) amp A feed and a one-hundred
(100) amp B feed and above), the Collocator must hire an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 power supplier to
coordinate the fuse changes at the AT&T-22STATE power plant.

Page 35 of 35
Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 09/10/08
19.5.4 When a power reduction request requires disconnecting and removing a power cable feed from either the
AT&T-22STATE’s BDFB (Battery Distribution Fuse Bay) or power plant, the AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 will
perform the power cable removal work up to the rack level.. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule
will apply. Within thirty (30) calendar days after submitting its power reduction request to disconnect and
remove a power arrangement, the Collocator must perform the following activity:
19.5.4.1 Remove terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to the AT&T-
22STATE rack level. Collocator must use a AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 for this procedure and
that supplier must follow TP76300 guidelines for cutting and capping the cable at the rack level.
19.6 When the Collocator has multiple power arrangement serving a Collocation Arrangement (e.g., one power
arrangement consisting of fifty (50) amps on the A feed and fifty (50) amps on the B feed and a second power
arrangement consisting of twenty (20) amps on the A feed and twenty (20) amps on the B feed), the Collocator has
the option of either fusing down the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed) or disconnecting and removing the
power cable feed from the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed). If the Collocator chooses to disconnect and
remove the power cable feed from a power arrangement (A&B feed), then the charges referenced in Pricing
Schedule will apply. If the Collocator has multiple power arrangements (A&B feed) where they can request both a
fuse reduction and a power cable removal for one Collocation Arrangement [e.g. reduce one power arrangement
from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to twenty (20) amps (A&B feed) and remove the power cable from a second power
arrangement from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to 5 amps (A&B feed)], then the project management fee for power
cable removal referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply in addition to the individual charges referenced in the
Pricing Schedule associated with the overall power reduction request.
19.7 For any power reduction request (one which involves either a disconnect and removal, re-fusing only, or a
combination of the two), the Collocator must submit an augment application for this request along with the
appropriate application and project management fees referenced in the Pricing Schedule. The same Augment
intervals that are outlined in this Attachment for adding power will apply to power reduction requests.
20.0 Collocation In CEV’S, HUTS And CABINETS
20.1 Remote Terminals - When the requirements of this Agreement are met, collocation will be allowed in Controlled
Environmental Vaults (CEV’s), Huts and Cabinets and other AT&T-22STATE owned or controlled premises where
Collocation is practical and Technically Feasible, e.g. where heat dissipation is not severely limited and there is
sufficient space for Collocator’s equipment.
20.2 AT&T-13STATE will assign space in a RT in two-inch vertical mounting space increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of two-inch vertical mounting spaces required is
determined by the size of the equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and
ventilation of the equipment to be placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates.
20.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also assign space in a RT in single bay increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of bays required is determined by the size of the
equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and ventilation of the equipment to be
placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates and charges.
20.4 AT&T-22STATE: RT Collocation Arrangements - AT&T-22STATE shall make available -48V DC power for
Collocator’s RT Collocation arrangement at an AT&T-22STATE power source within the RT. The charge for power
shall be assessed as part of the MRCs per the Pricing Schedule. If the power requirements for Collocator’s
equipment exceed the capacity available, then such additional power requirements shall be assessed on an
individual case basis.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE will furnish CLEC with
access to Unbundled Network Elements pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Telecommunications Act (herein
referred to as “251(c)(3) UNEs” or “UNEs”) for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act, Section
251(c)(3)) in AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange areas.
1.2 Nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute consent by AT&T-22STATE that any item
identified in this Agreement as a UNE or network element is a network element or UNE under Section 251(c)(3) of
the Act, as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and effective FCC and judicial
orders, that AT&T-22STATE is required to provide to CLEC alone, or in combination with other network elements or
UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise), or commingled with other network elements, UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise) or other
services or facilities.
1.3 The preceding includes without limitation that AT&T-22STATE shall not be obligated to provide combinations
(whether considered new, pre-existing or existing) or other arrangements (including, where applicable, Commingled
Arrangements) involving AT&T-22STATE network elements that do not constitute 251(c)(3) UNEs, or where
251(c)(3) UNEs are not requested for permissible purposes.
1.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Amendment to this Agreement, including but not limited
to intervening law, change in law or other substantively similar provision in the Agreement or any Amendment, if an
element described as an Unbundled Network Element or 251(c)(3) UNE in this Agreement is Declassified or is
otherwise no longer a 251(c)(3) UNE, then the Transition Procedure defined in Section 3.5 below, shall govern.
1.5 Access to 251(c)(3) UNEs is provided under this Agreement over such routes, technologies, and facilities as AT&T-
22STATE may elect at its own discretion. AT&T-22STATE will provide access to 251(c)(3) UNEs where technically
feasible. Where facilities and equipment are not available, AT&T-22STATE shall not be required to provide 251(c)(3)
UNEs.
1.6 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC under the provisions of this Attachment shall remain the property of AT&T-
22STATE.
1.7 Subject to the terms herein, AT&T-22STATE is responsible only for the installation, operation and maintenance of
the 251(c)(3) UNEs it provides. AT&T-22STATE is not otherwise responsible for the Telecommunications Services
provided by CLEC through the use of those 251(c)(3) UNEs.
1.8 Where 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC are dedicated to a single End User, if such 251(c)(3) UNEs are for any
reason disconnected they shall be made available to AT&T-22STATE for future provisioning needs, unless such
251(c)(3) UNE is disconnected in error. The CLEC agrees to relinquish control of any such 251(c)(3) UNE
concurrent with the disconnection of a CLEC’s End User’s service.
1.9 The Parties intend that this Attachment contains the sole and exclusive terms and conditions by which CLEC will
obtain UNEs from AT&T-21STATE. Accordingly, except as may be specifically permitted by this Attachment, and
then only to the extent permitted, CLEC and its Affiliates hereby fully and irrevocably waive any right or ability any of
them might have to purchase any UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs (or
otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling or otherwise) directly from any
AT&T-21STATE tariff, to the extent such tariff(s) is/are available, and agree not to so purchase or attempt to so
purchase from any such tariff. Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding
waiver, estoppel, laches, or similar concepts in other situations, the failure of AT&T-21STATE to enforce the
foregoing (including if AT&T-21STATE fails to reject or otherwise block orders for, or provides or continues to
provide, UNEs, or otherwise, under tariff) shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or
other similar concepts shall not act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder. At its option, AT&T-21STATE
may either reject any such order submitted under tariff, or without the need for any further contact with or consent
from CLEC, AT&T-21STATE may process any such order as being submitted under this Attachment and, further,
may convert any element provided under tariff, to this Attachment effective as of the later in time of (i) the Effective
Date of this Agreement, or (ii) the submission of the order by CLEC.

2.11 “Network Interface Device (NID)” means any interconnection of End User premises wiring to AT&T-22STATE’s
distribution UNE Loop facilities, such as a cross-connect device used for that purpose. Fundamentally, the NID
establishes the final (and official) network demarcation point between the UNE Loop and the End User's inside wire.
2.12 “Ratcheting” means a pricing mechanism that involves billing a single circuit at multiple rates to develop a single,
blended rate.
2.13 “Route” means a transmission path between one of AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Centers or switches and another of
AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Centers or switches. A Route between two points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire
Center or switch “Z”) may pass through one or more intermediate Wire Centers or switches (e.g., Wire Center or
switch “X”). Transmission paths between identical end points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire Center or
switch “Z”) are the same Route, irrespective of whether they pass through the same intermediate Wire Centers or
switches, if any.
2.14 “Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT)” means AT&T-22STATE interoffice transmission facilities between Wire
Centers or switches owned by AT&T-22STATE, or between Wire Centers or switches owned by AT&T-22STATE
and switches owned by requesting Telecommunications Carriers, dedicated to a particular End User or carrier.
AT&T-22STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access to Dedicated Transport that does not
connect a pair of AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers.
2.15 “UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber/Dark Fiber Transport” means AT&T-22STATE dark fiber interoffice
transmission facilities dedicated to a particular CLEC that are within AT&T-22STATE’s network, connecting AT&T-
22STATE switches or Wire Centers within a LATA. Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber consists of un-activated optical
interoffice transmission facilities.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 The rates for UNEs, UNE Combinations and Other Services are set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
3.2 If CLEC procures any UNEs, UNE Combinations and/or Other Services for which rates are not currently in the Pricing
Schedule, AT&T-22STATE then reserves the right to charge a current state-specific price/market-based rate.
3.3 Without limitation, a UNE under this Agreement is Declassified upon or by (a) the issuance of an effective finding by
a court or regulatory agency acting within its authority that requesting Telecommunications Carriers are not impaired
without access to a particular UNE; or (b) an effective determination by a legislative, judicial or regulatory body
finding that an ILEC is not required, or is no longer required, to provide the UNE pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the
Act; or (c) the absence, by vacatur or otherwise, of a legally effective FCC rule requiring the provision of the UNE on
an unbundled basis pursuant to Section 251(c)(3). By way of example only, a UNE can be Declassified generally, or
on an element-specific, Route-specific or geographically-specific basis or on a class of elements basis. For
declassification of elements as the result of changes to Wire Center designations, Section 14.0 below shall apply.
3.4 If this Agreement requires or appears to require UNE(s) or the unbundling of an element without specifically noting a
particular UNE or UNEs, the reference shall be deemed to be a reference to 251(c )(3) UNE(s), as defined in this
Attachment. If a UNE is Declassified or is not required to be provided under this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment and/or
not described in this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment, it is the Parties’ intent that the UNE is not available under this
Agreement, notwithstanding any reference to the UNE elsewhere in the Agreement, including in any other
Attachment, or in the Pricing Schedule.
3.5 Transition Procedure for UNEs that are Declassified during the Term of the Agreement:
3.5.1 The procedure set forth in this Section does not apply to the Declassification events described in Sections
8.1.4 below, Section 9.1.7 below which set forth the consequences for Declassification of DS1 and DS3
Loops, DS1 and DS3 Transport and Dark Fiber Transport, where applicable Caps are met, or where
Declassification occurs because Wire Centers/Routes meet the criteria set forth in the FCC’s TRO Remand
Order (TRRO).

3.5.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall only be obligated to provide Section 251 (c)(3) UNEs under this
Agreement as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and
effective FCC and judicial orders. To the extent an element described as a UNE or an
Unbundled Network Element in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a UNE,
AT&T-22STATE may discontinue the provision of such element, whether previously provided
alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement with other UNEs or other
elements or services. Accordingly, in the event one or more elements described as UNEs or as
Unbundled Network Elements in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a UNE,
AT&T-22STATE will identify such Declassified UNEs and provide written Notice to CLEC of its
discontinuance of the element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the
element(s) has been previously provided. During a “Transitional Period” of thirty (30) calendar
days from the date of such Notice, AT&T-22STATE agrees to continue providing such
element(s) under the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of such written Notice, CLEC will
cease ordering elements that are identified as Declassified or as otherwise no longer being
available as a UNE in the AT&T-22STATE Notice letter. AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to
review CLEC’s orders transmitted to AT&T-22STATE and to the extent that CLEC has
processed orders and such orders are provisioned after the Transitional Period, such elements
are still subject to this Section, including the options set forth in (a) and (b) below, and AT&T-
22STATE’s rights of discontinuance or conversion in the event the options are not accomplished.
During the Transitional Period, the following options are available to CLEC with regard to the
element(s) identified in the AT&T-22STATE Notice, including the combination or other
arrangement in which the element(s) were previously provided:
3.5.1.1.1 CLEC may issue a Local Service Request (LSR) or Access Service Request
(ASR), as applicable, to seek disconnection or other discontinuance of the
element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the element(s)
were previously provided; or
3.5.1.1.2 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC may agree upon another service arrangement or
element (e.g., via a separate agreement at market-based rates to the extent AT&T-
22STATE offers such an agreement, or an equivalent tariffed AT&T-22STATE
service, or resale), or may agree that an analogous access product or service may
be substituted, if available.
3.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at
the end of that thirty (30) calendar day Transitional Period described in Section 3.5.1.1 above, unless CLEC
has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as applicable, under (a), above, and/or if CLEC
and AT&T-22STATE have failed to reach agreement under (b), above, as to a substitute service
arrangement or element, then AT&T-22STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect the element(s), whether
previously provided alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement, or convert the subject
element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement to an analogous
resale or access service, if available.
4.0 Responsibilities Of The Parties
4.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide access to UNEs for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act,
Section 251(c)(3).
4.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for the services it provides to its End Users and to other Telecommunications
Carriers.
4.3 CLEC’s use of any AT&T-22STATE UNE, or of its own equipment or facilities in conjunction with any AT&T-
22STATE UNE, must not materially interfere with or impair service over any facilities of AT&T-22STATE, its affiliated
companies or its connecting and concurring carriers involved in its services, cause damage to their plant, impair the
privacy of any communications carried over their facilities or create hazards to the employees of any of them or the

from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
4.5.3 AT&T-22STATE may elect to conduct upgrades or conversions for the improvement of its network or
systems. During such upgrades or conversions, CLEC orders for UNEs from affected Wire Center(s) may
be suspended for a period of a few days prior and one day after the upgrade or conversion date, consistent
with the suspension AT&T-22STATE places on itself for orders from its End Users and other CLEC’s End
Users.
4.5.4 CLEC will be solely responsible, at its own expense, for the overall design of its Telecommunications
Services and for any redesigning or rearrangement of its Telecommunications Services that may be
required because of changes in facilities, operations, or procedure of AT&T-22STATE minimum network
protection criteria, or operating or maintenance characteristics of the facilities.
4.6 Conditions for Access to UNEs:

COCI rates, terms and conditions are set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
6.0 New Combinations, Conversions, Commingling and EELs
6.1 New Combinations Involving UNEs:
6.1.1 Subject to the provisions hereof and upon CLEC request, AT&T-22STATE shall meet its combining
obligations involving UNEs as to the extent required by FCC rules and orders.
6.1.2 To the extent CLEC requests a combination for which AT&T-22STATE does not have methods and
procedures in place to provide such combination, rates and/or methods or procedures for such combination
may be developed pursuant to the Bona Fide Request (BFR) process described in Attachment 08 - Bona
Fide Request. Where electronic ordering is not available, manual ordering shall be used.
6.1.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will charge CLEC the applicable recurring and nonrecurring charges for each
individual UNE and/or combinations as set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
6.1.3 Without affecting the other provisions hereof, the UNE combining obligations referenced in this Section
apply only in situations where each of the following is met:
6.1.3.1 it is technically feasible, including that network reliability and security would not be impaired;
6.1.3.2 AT&T-22STATE’s ability to retain responsibility for the management, control, and performance
of its network would not be impaired;
6.1.3.3 AT&T-22STATE would not be placed at a disadvantage in operating its own network;
6.1.3.4 it would not undermine the ability of other Telecommunications Carriers to obtain access to
251(c)(3) UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s network; and
6.1.3.5 CLEC is either unable to make the combination itself; or a new entrant and is unaware that it
needs to combine certain UNEs to provide a Telecommunications Service, but such obligation
under this Section ceases if AT&T-22STATE informs CLEC of such need to combine.
6.1.4 For purposes of Section 6.1.3.5 above and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
make a combination itself, CLEC is deemed able to make a combination itself when the UNE(s) sought to
be combined are available to CLEC, including without limitation on/at an AT&T-22STATE Premise, as
defined in the Attachment 12 - Collocation.
6.2 Conversion of Wholesale Services to 251(c)(3)UNE/UNE Combinations Or 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combinations to
Wholesale Services:
6.2.1 Upon request, AT&T-22STATE shall convert a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the
equivalent UNE/UNE combinations that is/are available to CLEC pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Act
and under this Agreement, or convert UNE/UNE combination(s) that is/are available to CLEC pursuant to
Section 251(c)(3) of the Act and under this Agreement to an equivalent wholesale service or group of
wholesale services offered by AT&T-22STATE (collectively “Conversion”).

6.2.5 Where processes for the Conversion requested pursuant to this Attachment are not already in place, the
Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum guidelines.
6.2.6 If CLEC does not meet the applicable eligibility criteria or, for any reason, stops meeting the eligibility criteria
for a particular Conversion of a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the equivalent
251(c)(3)UNE, or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, CLEC shall not request such Conversion or continue
using such 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNEs that result from such Conversion. To the extent CLEC fails to
meet (including ceases to meet) the eligibility criteria applicable to a 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of
251(c)(3) UNEs, AT&T-22STATE may convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNE combination to the
equivalent wholesale service or group of wholesale services, upon written Notice to CLEC.
6.2.6.1 This Section applies to any 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, including whether
or not such 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs had been previously converted
from an AT&T-22STATE service.
6.2.6.2 AT&T-22STATE may exercise its rights provided for hereunder and those allowed by law to
ensure compliance with any applicable eligibility criteria.

6.2.7.1 AT&T-22STATE shall charge the applicable non-recurring service order charge and applicable
switch-as-is rates as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, for Conversions to specific UNE/UNE
Combinations. AT&T-22STATE shall also charge the applicable non-recurring service order
charge and applicable switch-as-is rates, as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, when converting
from UNE/UNE combinations.
6.3 Commingling:
6.3.1 Commingling is not permitted, nor is AT&T-22STATE required to perform the functions necessary to
Commingle, where the Commingled Arrangement (i) is not technically feasible, including that network
reliability and security would be impaired; or (ii) would impair AT&T-22STATE’s ability to retain responsibility
for the management, control, and performance of its network; or (iii) would place AT&T-22STATE at a
disadvantage in operating its own network; or (iv) would undermine the ability of other Telecommunications
Carriers to obtain access to UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s network.
6.3.2 Where processes for any Commingling requested pursuant to this Agreement (including, by way of
example, for existing services sought to be converted to a Commingled Arrangement) are not already in
place, AT&T-22STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and
conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum (CUF)
guidelines and/or will be developed pursuant to the BFR process.
6.3.3 Any Commingling obligation is limited solely to Commingling of one or more facilities or services that are
provided at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE with UNEs; accordingly, no other facilities, services or
functionalities are subject to Commingling, including but not limited to facilities, services or functionalities
that AT&T-22STATE might offer pursuant to Section 271 of the Act.
6.3.4 Except as provided in Section 6.3 above and, further, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
AT&T-22STATE shall permit CLEC to Commingle a UNE or a combination of UNEs with facilities or
services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE to the extent required by effective FCC rules and

above applies to the Commingled Arrangement sought by CLEC; or (ii) the CLEC is able to perform those
functions itself. Where CLEC is a new entrant and is unaware that it needs to Commingle to provide a
Telecommunications Service, AT&T-22STATE’s obligation to Commingle ceases if AT&T-22STATE
informs CLEC of such need to Commingle.
6.3.6 For purposes of Section 6.3.1 above and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
Commingle for itself, CLEC is deemed able to Commingle for itself when the UNE(s), UNE combination, and
facilities or services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE are available to CLEC at the CLEC’s
Collocation Arrangement. For Collocation terms and conditions see Attachment 12 – Collocation.
6.3.7 AT&T-22STATE has developed a list of Commingled Arrangements that will be available for ordering. This
list is posted on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
6.3.7.1 Any request by CLEC for a Commingled Arrangement not included in such list may be made via
Attachment 08 - Bona Fide Request. In any such BFR, CLEC must designate among other
things the 251(c)(3) UNE(s), combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, and the facilities or services that
CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE sought to be Commingled and the
needed location(s), the order in which such 251(c)(3) UNEs, such combinations of 251(c)(3)
UNEs, and such facilities and services are to be Commingled, and how each connection (e.g.
cross-connected) is to be made between them.
6.3.8 AT&T-22STATE will charge the appropriate recurring and non-recurring rates as identified in the Pricing
Schedule. AT&T-22STATE shall charge the appropriate non-recurring rates as set forth in the Pricing
Schedule(s) applicable to the 251(c)(3) UNEs (or 251(c)(3) UNE combinations) that are Commingled on a
251(c)(3) UNE-by-251(c)(3) UNE basis, and for the facilities and services that are Commingled (under this
Section 6.3 above) on a facility-by-facility, service-by-service basis, including without limitation for the type
of service and activity being requested to create the Commingled Arrangement.
6.3.9 AT&T-22STATE shall not be required to, and shall not, provide Ratcheting as a result of Commingling or a
Commingled Arrangement.

6.4.6 CLEC hereby agrees that by submitting an order to AT&T-22STATE for an Included Arrangement (whether
new, as a result of a requested Conversion, or otherwise), CLEC is certifying that it meets and will continue
to meet the requirements of Section 6.4 above as to such Included Arrangement(s) on a circuit-by-
circuit/service-by-service/Included Arrangement-by-Included Arrangement basis. Such certification-by-order
shall have the same weight and effect as a separate certification, and certification-by-order shall not
diminish or otherwise affect CLEC’s obligation to meet and to continue to comply with the criteria or
certification requirements set forth in this Section.
6.4.6.1 If the information previously provided in a certification is inaccurate (or ceases to be accurate),
CLEC shall update such certification promptly with AT&T-22STATE.
6.4.7 In addition to any other audit rights provided for this Agreement and those allowed by law, AT&T-22STATE
may obtain and pay for an independent auditor to audit CLEC, on an annual basis, applied on a State-by-
State basis, for compliance with this Section. For purposes of calculating and applying an “annual basis,” it
means a consecutive twelve (12) month period for each individual State, beginning upon AT&T-22STATE’s
written Notice that an audit will be performed for that State, subject to Section 6.4.7.4 below.
6.4.7.1 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties (including at the time of the audit), the independent
auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the standards established by the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which will require the auditor to
perform an “examination engagement” and issue an opinion regarding CLEC’s compliance with
the qualifying service eligibility criteria.
6.4.7.2 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all material respects
with this Section 6.4 above.
6.4.7.3 Consistent with standard auditing practices, such audits require compliance testing designed by
the independent auditor, which typically includes an examination of a sample selected in
accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment.
6.4.7.4 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with this
Section 6.4 above, CLEC must true-up any difference in payments beginning from the date that
the non-compliant circuit was established as a 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combination, in whole or in
part (notwithstanding any other provision hereof), CLEC must convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or
251(c)(3) UNE Combination, or Commingled Arrangement, to an equivalent or substantially
similar wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, (and AT&T-22STATE may initiate and
affect such a conversion on its own without any further consent by CLEC), and CLEC shall timely
make the correct payments on a going-forward basis, and all applicable remedies for failure to
make such payments shall be available to AT&T-22STATE. In no event shall rates set under
Section 252(d)(1) of the Act apply for the use of any 251(c)(3) UNE for any period in which CLEC
does not meet the conditions set forth in this Section 6.4 above for that 251(c)(3) UNE,
arrangement, or circuit, as the case may be. Also, the “annual basis” calculation and application
shall be immediately reset, e.g., AT&T-22STATE shall not have to wait the remaining part of the
consecutive twelve (12) month period before it is permitted to audit again in that state.
6.4.7.4.1 To the extent that the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to
comply in all material respects with this Section 6.4 above, CLEC must reimburse
AT&T-22STATE for the cost of the independent auditor and for AT&T-22STATE’s
costs in the same manner and using the same methodology and rates that AT&T-
22STATE is required to pay CLEC’s costs under Section 6.4.7.4.2 below.
6.4.7.4.2 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that the CLEC complied in
all material respects with this Section 6.4 above, AT&T-22STATE must reimburse
CLEC for its reasonable staff time and other reasonable costs associated in
responding to the audit (e.g., collecting data in response to the auditor’s inquiries,
meeting for interviews, etc.).

6.4.7.5 CLEC will maintain the appropriate documentation to support its eligibility certifications including,
without limitation, call detail records, local telephone number assignment documentation, and
switch assignment documentation.
6.4.8 Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel, laches,
or similar concepts in other situations, CLEC shall fully comply with this Section in all cases and, further, the
failure of AT&T-22STATE to require such compliance, including if AT&T-22STATE provides a circuit(s), an
EEL(s), or a Commingled circuit, that does not meet any eligibility criteria, including those in this Section,
shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not
act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder.

7.1.4 Any repairs, upgrade and rearrangements to the NID required by CLEC will be performed by AT&T-
21STATE based on Time and Material charges. AT&T-21STATE, at the request of CLEC, will disconnect
the AT&T-21STATE UNE Loop from the NID at charges reflected in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.5 With respect to multiple dwelling units or multiple-unit business premises, CLEC will connect directly with
the End User’s premises wire, or may connect with the End User’s premises wire via AT&T-21STATE’s NID
where necessary.
7.1.6 The AT&T-21STATE NIDs that CLEC uses under this Attachment will be existing NIDs installed by AT&T-
21STATE to serve its End Users.
7.1.7 CLEC shall not attach to or disconnect AT&T-21STATE’s ground. CLEC shall not cut or disconnect AT&T-
21STATE’s UNE Loop from the NID and/or its protector. CLEC shall not cut any other leads in the UNE
NID.
7.1.8 CLEC, when it has constructed its own NID at a premises and needs only to make contact with AT&T-
21STATE’s NID, can disconnect the End User’s wiring from AT&T-21STATE’s NID and reconnect it to
CLEC’s NID.
8.0 UNE Loop
8.1.1 Subject to Section 3.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE shall provide unbundled access to UNE

9.1.7 Declassification Procedure
9.1.7.1 Wire Center “Tiers” – For purposes of Sections 9.0 above and 10.0 below Wire Centers are
classified into three “tiers,” as follows:
9.1.7.1.1 Tier 1 Wire Centers are those AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers that contain at least
four (4) fiber-based Collocators, at least 38,000 business lines, or both. Tier 1 Wire
Centers also are those AT&T-22STATE tandem switching locations that have no
Line-Side switching facilities, but nevertheless serve as a point of traffic
aggregation accessible by CLEC. Once a Wire Center is determined to be a Tier 1
Wire Center, that Wire Center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 2 or
Tier 3 Wire Center.
9.1.7.1.2 Tier 2 Wire Centers are those AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers that are not Tier 1
Wire Centers, but contain at least three (3) fiber-based Collocators, at least 24,000
business lines, or both. Once a Wire Center is determined to be a Tier 2 Wire
Center, that Wire Center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 3 Wire
Center.
9.1.7.1.3 Tier 3 Wire Centers are those AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers that do not meet the
criteria for Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers.
9.1.7.2 DS1 Dedicated Transport Declassification
9.1.7.2.1 Subject to the Cap described in Section 9.1.6.3 above AT&T-22STATE shall
provide CLEC with access to DS1 UDT on Routes, except Routes where both Wire
Centers defining the Route are Tier 1 Wire Centers. As such, AT&T-22STATE
must provide UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport under this Agreement only if a Wire
Center at either end of a requested Route is not a Tier 1 Wire Center, or if neither
is a Tier 1 Wire Center. DS1 Dedicated Transport circuits on Routes between Tier
1 Wire Centers are Declassified and no longer available as UNEs under this

10.5 CLEC requesting UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber must submit a Dark Fiber Facility Inquiry, providing CLEC’s
specific point-to-point (A to Z) dark fiber requirements. Rates for the Dark Fiber Facility Inquiry are as set forth in the
Pricing Schedule.
10.6 For Quantities and Time Frames for ordering UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, refer to the AT&T CLEC Online
website.
10.7 Right of Revocation of Access to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber:
10.7.1 Right of revocation of access to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is distinguishable from
Declassification. For clarification purposes, AT&T-21STATE’s right of revocation of access under this
Section applies even when the affected Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber remains a UNE, subject to
unbundling obligations under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, in which case CLEC’s rights to the affected
network element may be revoked as provided in this Section.
10.7.2 Should CLEC not utilize the fiber strand(s) subscribed to within the twelve (12) month period following the
date AT&T-21STATE provided the fiber(s), AT&T-21STATE may revoke CLEC’s access to the UNE
Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber and recover those fiber facilities and return them to AT&T-21STATE’s
inventory.
10.7.3 AT&T-21STATE may reclaim from CLEC the right to use UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, whether or
not such fiber is being utilized by CLEC, upon twelve (12) months written Notice to CLEC. If the reclaimed
UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is not otherwise Declassified during the Notice period, AT&T-
21STATE will provide an alternative facility for CLEC with the same bandwidth CLEC was using prior to
reclaiming the facility. AT&T-21STATE must also demonstrate upon CLEC’s request that the reclaimed
Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber will be needed to meet AT&T-21STATE’s bandwidth requirements within
the twelve (12) months following the revocation.
10.8 Access Methods Specific to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber:
10.8.1 The termination point for UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber at central offices will be in an AT&T-
21STATE-approved splitter shelf. This arrangement allows for non-intrusive testing.
10.8.2 At central offices, UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber terminates on a fiber distribution frame, or
equivalent, in the central office. CLEC access is provided via Collocation.
10.9 For Installation and Maintenance for UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, refer to AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
10.9.1 AT&T-21STATE will install termination points and place the fiber jumpers from the fiber optic terminals to
the termination point. CLEC will run its fiber jumpers from the termination point (1x2, 90-10 optical splitter)
to CLEC.
10.10 Dark Fiber Transport Declassification:
10.10.1 AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC with access to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, except on Routes
where both Wire Centers defining the Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, as described in Section
14.0 below As such, AT&T-22STATE must provide UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber under this
Agreement only if a Wire Center on either end of the requested Route is a Tier 3 Wire Center. If both Wire
Centers defining a requested Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, then Dedicated Transport Dark
Fiber circuits on such Routes are Declassified and no longer available as UNEs under this Agreement.
Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering UNE Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber on such Route(s).
10.10.2 Effect on Embedded Base – Upon Declassification of Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber already purchased by
CLEC as UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC of such
Declassification, and proceed in accordance with Section 14.0 below. At the end of the Notice period under
that Section, provision of the affected Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber to CLEC will be terminated without
further obligation of AT&T-22STATE.

10.10.3 Products provided by AT&T-22STATE in conjunction with UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, if any, shall
also be subject to termination under this section where such fiber is Declassified.
10.10.4 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-22STATE under this Section shall not be subject to the Network
Disclosure Rules.
11.0 Routine Network Modifications for UNE Loops, UNE DS1, DS3 and Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport
11.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall make Routine Network Modifications (RNM) to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and
Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport facilities used by CLEC where the requested UNE facility has already been
constructed. AT&T-22STATE shall perform RNM to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the UNE facility
being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
11.1.2 A “Routine Network Modification” is an activity that AT&T regularly undertakes for its own customers. RNM
include rearranging or splicing of existing cable; adding an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater;
adding a smart jack; installing a repeater shelf; adding a line card; deploying a new multiplexer or
reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and attaching electronic and other equipment that AT&T-22STATE
ordinarily attaches to activate such UNE Loops or Transport facilities for its own retail End Users, under the
same conditions and in the same manner that AT&T-22STATE does for its own End Users. RNM may
entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable and installing
equipment casings. AT&T-22STATE will place drops in the same manner as it does for its own End Users
11.1.3 RNM do not include constructing new UNE Loops; or UNE DS1, DS3, or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport;
installing new cable or fiber; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new manholes or
conduits; installing new terminals; or removing or reconfiguring packetized transmission facility. Nor do
RNM include the provision of electronics for the purpose of lighting dark fiber (i.e., optronics). AT&T-
22STATE is not obligated to perform those activities for CLEC.
11.1.4 AT&T-22STATE shall determine whether and how to perform RNM using the same network or outside plant
engineering principles that would be applied in providing service to AT&T-22STATE’s retail End Users.
11.1.5 AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to build Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) capability into new packet-
based networks or into existing packet-based networks that never had TDM capability.
11.1.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-22STATE’s obligations with respect to RNM apply
only where the UNE Loop and Transport transmission facilities are subject to unbundling and do not apply to
FTTH UNE Loops or FTTC UNE Loops.
11.1.7 AT&T-22STATE shall provide RNM at the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this Attachment and in the
Pricing Schedule or at rates to be determined on an individual case basis (ICB) or through the Special
Construction (SC) process. AT&T-22STATE will impose charges for RNM in instances where such charges
are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and non-recurring
charges. The Parties agree that the RNM for which AT&T-22STATE is not recovering costs in existing
recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which costs will be imposed on CLEC as an ICB/SC include,
but are not limited to: (i) adding an equipment case, (ii) adding a doubler or repeater including associated
line card(s), (iii) installing a repeater shelf, and any other necessary work and parts associated with a
repeater shelf, and (iv) where applicable, deploying multiplexing equipment, to the extent such equipment is
not present on the UNE Loop or Transport facility when ordered.
12.0 911/E911 Database
12.1.1 Access to the AT&T-22STATE 911/ E911 call-related databases will be provided as described in
Attachment 05 - 911/E911.
13.0 Operations Support Systems (OSS) FUNCTIONS

will provide CLEC access to its OSS Functions as outlined in Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems
(OSS).
14.0 Non-Impaired Wire Center Criteria And Related Processes
14.1 AT&T-22STATE has designated and posted, to AT&T CLEC Online website, the Wire Centers where it contends the
thresholds for DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity UNE Loops (as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4) and
Rule 51.319(a)(5) and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Non-Impaired Wire Centers as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i)
and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii)) have been met.
14.2 Commission-approved Wire Center Lists:
14.2.1 In states where the Commission has already determined that a Wire Center is properly designated as a
Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule 51.319(a)(5), Rule
51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), CLEC may no longer self-certify or request DS1/DS3 High-
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
declassified by the non-impairment status of the Wire Center in such Wire Center.
14.3 Wire Center Lists Pending Commission Approval:
14.3.1 In states where the Commission has not previously determined, in any proceeding, that a Wire Center is
properly designated as a Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), AT&T-22STATE’s designations shall be treated
as controlling (even if CLEC believes the list is inaccurate) for purposes of transition and ordering unless
CLEC provides a self-certification as outlined below. If a CLEC withdraws its self-certification after a dispute
has been filed with the Commission, but before the Commission has made a determination regarding the
wire center designation, the wire center designation(s) that were the subject of the dispute will be treated as
though the Commission approved AT&T-22STATE’s designations.
14.4 Self-Certifications:
14.4.1 CLEC shall perform a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine whether, to the best of CLEC ’s knowledge,
the Wire Center meets the non-impairment thresholds as set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii).
14.4.2 If, based on its reasonably diligent inquiry, the CLEC disputes the AT&T-22STATE Wire Center non-
impairment designation, the CLEC will provide a self-certification to AT&T-22STATE identifying the Wire
Center(s) for which it is self-certifying. To self-certify, CLEC can send a letter to AT&T-22STATE claiming
Self Certification or CLEC may elect to self-certify using a written or electronic notification sent to AT&T-
22STATE.
14.4.3 If CLEC makes such a self-certification, and CLEC is otherwise entitled to the ordered element under the
Agreement, then AT&T-22STATE shall provision the requested facilities in accordance with CLEC’s order
and within AT&T-22STATE’s standard ordering interval applicable to such facilities.
14.4.4 If AT&T-22STATE in error rejects CLEC orders, where CLEC has provided self certification in accordance
with this Section of this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE will modify its systems to accept such orders within 5
business hours of CLEC notification to its Local Service Specialist.
14.4.5 CLEC may not submit a self-certification for a Wire Center after the transition period for the DS1/DS3 UNE
Loops and/or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport impacted by the
designation of the Wire Center has passed.
14.5 CLEC may not self-certify that it is entitled to obtain Unbundled DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or Unbundled DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport at a location where CLEC has met the volume Cap set forth in Sections 8.1.3.4.4 above and
8.1.3.5.4 above (for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops) and 9.1.6.3 above and 9.1.6.2 above (for DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport).
14.6 Until CLEC provides a self-certification for High-Capacity UNE Loops and/or Transport for such Wire Center
designations, CLEC will not submit High Capacity UNE Loop and/or Transport orders based on the Wire Center
designation, and if no self-certification is provided will transition any remaining Embedded Base of DS1 and DS3

UNE Loop and Transport and Dark Fiber Transport arrangements affected by the designation by disconnecting or
transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within thirty (30) calendar days of executing this
Agreement. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or arrangement within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning billing CLEC the equivalent special
access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the Transitional Rates.
14.7 AT&T-22STATE will update the AT&T CLEC Online website posted list and will advise CLECs of such posting via
Accessible Letter, which term for the purposes of this Section above of this Agreement shall be deemed to mean an
Accessible Letter issued after the Effective Date of this Agreement, as set forth in this Section 14.0 above of this
Agreement
14.8 If it desires to do so, AT&T-22STATE can dispute the self-certification and associated CLEC orders for facilities
pursuant to the following procedures:
14.8.1 AT&T-22STATE will notify the CLEC of its intent to dispute the CLEC’s self-certification within thirty (30)
calendar days of the CLEC ’s self-certification or within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date of this
Agreement, whichever is later.
14.8.2 AT&T-22STATE will file the dispute for resolution with the state Commission within sixty (60) calendar days
of the CLEC’s self-certification or within sixty (60) calendar days of the Effective Date of this Agreement,
whichever is later.
14.8.3 AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC of the filing of such a dispute via Accessible Letter.
14.8.4 If the self-certification dispute is filed with the state Commission for resolution, the Parties will not oppose
requests for intervention by other CLECs if such request is related to the disputed Wire Center
designation(s). The Parties agree to urge the state Commission to adopt a case schedule resulting in the
prompt resolution of the dispute.
14.9 During the timeframe of any dispute resolution proceeding, AT&T-22STATE shall continue to provide the High-
Capacity UNE Loop or Transport facility in question to CLEC at the rates in the Pricing Schedule.
14.10 If CLEC withdraws its self-certification, or if the state Commission determines through arbitration or otherwise that
CLEC was not entitled to the provisioned DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport under Section 251, the rates paid by CLEC for the affected UNE Loop or Transport shall be
subject to true-up as follows:
14.10.1 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-22STATE prior to March 11, 2005 and
14.10.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed prior to March 11, 2005,
14.10.2.1 CLEC will provide a true-up calculated using a beginning date of March 11, 2005 based on the
FCC transitional rates which are the rates in effect at the time of the non-impairment
designations plus 15% (“Transitional Rates”). If affected UNE Loops/Transport element(s)
remain in place after the end of the initial TRRO transition period, CLEC will also provide a true-
up for the period after the end of initial TRRO transition period calculated using the equivalent
special access rates during the period between the end of the initial transition period and the
date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will
be determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special access
rate/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply until the facility has been
transitioned.
14.10.2.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed after March 11, 2005, CLEC will
provide a true-up to an equivalent special access rate as of the later of the date billing began for
the provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of non-
impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the
Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special access rate/Transitional Rates will
continue to apply until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-22STATE after March 11, 2005,

14.10.2.3.1 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered before AT&T-22STATE’s Wire
Center designation,
14.10.2.3.1.1 if the applicable transition period is within the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 15.0 below of this Agreement, CLEC will
provide a true-up during the period between the date that is thirty (30)
calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and
the date the circuit is transitioned to the Transitional Rates.
14.10.2.3.1.2 if the applicable transition period is after the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 14.1 above of this Agreement has
expired, CLEC will provide a true-up based on the Transitional Rates
between the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-
22STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and the end of the applicable
transition period described in Section 15.1 below and the equivalent
special access rates during the period between the end of the initial
transition period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no
equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined
using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply
until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3.2 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered after AT&T-22STATE’s Wire
Center designation, CLEC will provide a true-up for the affected UNE
Loop/Transport element(s) to an equivalent special access rate for the affected
UNE Loop/Transport element(s) as of the later of the date billing began for the
provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of
non-impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be
determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates will continue to apply until the facility has been
transitioned.
14.10.3 In the event of a dispute following CLEC’s Self-Certification, upon request by the Commission or CLEC,
AT&T-22STATE will make available, subject to the appropriate state or federal protective order, and other
reasonable safeguards, all documentation and all data upon which AT&T-22STATE intends to rely, which
will include the detailed business line information for the AT&T-22STATE Wire Center or centers that are
the subject of the dispute.
15.0 Future Wire Center Designations
15.1 The parties recognize that Wire Centers that AT&T-22STATE had not designated as meeting the FCC’s non-
impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005, may meet those thresholds in the future. In the event that a Wire
Center that is not currently designated as meeting one or more of the FCC’s non-impairment thresholds, meets one
or more of these thresholds at a later date, AT&T-22STATE may add the Wire Center to the list of designated Wire
Centers and the Parties will use the following process:
15.1.1 AT&T-22STATE may update the Wire Center list as changes occur.
15.1.2 To designate a Wire Center that had previously not met one or more of the FCC’s impairment thresholds but
subsequently does so, AT&T-22STATE will provide notification to CLEC via Accessible Letter and by a
posting on AT&T CLEC Online website.
15.1.3 AT&T-22STATE will continue to accept CLEC orders for impacted DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport without requiring CLEC self-certification for
thirty (30) calendar days after the date the Accessible Letter is issued.

15.1.4 In the event the CLEC disagrees with AT&T-22STATE’s determination, CLEC will have sixty (60) calendar
days from the issuance of the Accessible Letter to dispute AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Center determination by
providing a self-certification to AT&T-22STATE.
15.1.5 If the CLEC does not use the self-certification process described in Section 15.1.4 above to self-certify
against AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Center designation within sixty (60) calendar days of the issuance of the
Accessible Letter, CLEC must transition all circuits that have been declassified by the Wire Center
designation(s) by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within
thirty (30) calendar days ending on the 90th day after the issuance of the Accessible Letter providing the
Wire Center designation of non-impairment; no additional notification from AT&T-22STATE will be required.
CLEC may not obtain new DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport in Wire Centers and/or Routes where such circuits have been declassified during the
applicable transition period. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or arrangement
within such thirty (30) day period, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning billing CLEC
the equivalent special access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined
using the transitional rates set forth in Section 15.2 below.
15.1.6 If CLEC does provide self-certification to dispute AT&T-22STATE’s designation determination within sixty
(60) calendar days of the issuance of the Accessible Letter, AT&T-22STATE may dispute CLEC’s self-
certification as described in Section 14.8 above of this Agreement and AT&T-22STATE will accept and
provision the applicable UNE Loop and Transport orders for the CLEC providing the self certification during
a dispute resolution process.
15.2 During the applicable transition period, the transition rates paid will be rates in effect at the time of the non-
impairment designations plus 15%.
16.0 Transition Procedures of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport arrangements impacted by Wire Center designation(s)
16.1 The provisions of Section 14.1 above of this Attachment shall apply to the transition of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements impacted by Wire Center
designation(s). As outlined in Section 14.1 above of this Attachment, requested transitions of DS1/DS3 High
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall be
performed in a manner that reasonably minimizes the disruption or degradation to CLEC ’s End User’s service, and
all applicable charges shall apply. Cross-connects provided by AT&T-22STATE in conjunction with such UNE Loops
and/or Transport shall be billed at applicable wholesale rates (e.g., prior to transition, cross connects will be billed at
transitional rates, after transition, if conversion is to an access product, cross connects will be billed at applicable
access rates. Cross-connects that are not associated with such transitioned DS1/DS3 High-Capacity UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall not be re-priced.
16.2 AT&T-22STATE will process CLEC orders for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport, or Dark Fiber
Transport conversion or disconnection. AT&T-22STATE will not convert or disconnect these services prior to the
end of the applicable transitional period unless specifically requested by the CLEC; however, CLEC is responsible for
ensuring that it submits timely orders in order to complete the transition by the end of applicable transitional period in
an orderly manner.
16.3 A Building that is served by both an impaired Wire Center and a non impaired Wire Center and that is not located in
the serving area for the non-impaired Wire Center will continue to have affected elements available from the impaired
Wire Center and support incremental moves, adds, and changes otherwise permitted by the Agreement, as
amended.
16.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at the end
of the applicable transitional period, unless CLEC has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as
applicable, under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement, and if CLEC and AT&T-22STATE have failed to reach
agreement under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement as to a substitute service arrangement or element, then
AT&T-22STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark

2.2 AT&T-21STATE will not guarantee that an xDSL Loop or xDSL/UCSL Subloops ordered by CLEC will perform as
desired by CLEC for xDSL based services, but will guarantee that Loops will be provisioned to meet basic metallic
Loop parameters, including continuity and pair balance. CLEC shall designate on its Local Service Request (LSR),
at CLEC’s sole option, what Loop conditioning AT&T-21STATE is to perform in provisioning the order.
2.3 The Parties shall comply with the FCC’s lawful and effective spectrum management rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.231-233, as
such rules may be modified from time to time. Refer to AT&T CLEC Online website for specific processes addressing
Spectrum Management.
2.4 Maintenance, Repair and Testing:
2.4.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Maintenance Repair and Testing in accordance with the lawful and effective
requirements of 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(iv) and as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website and within
Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems (OSS).
2.4.2 Line and Station Transfer (LST): For a loop currently in service where trouble ticket resolution has identified
that excessive bridged tap(s), load coil(s) and/or repeater(s) are on the loop and transferring to a new loop
is a solution identified by AT&T-12STATE to resolve a trouble, AT&T-12STATE, at its sole option, may
perform an LST to resolve the identified trouble. In the event that a request for conditioning is received from
the CLEC on a loop currently in service and AT&T-12STATE determines that an LST can be performed, the
AT&T-12STATE LOC will contact the CLEC to inform it of the decision to perform an LST in lieu of CLEC’s
requested conditioning. In such case, the charge for the LST set forth in the Pricing Schedule shall apply in
lieu of any loop conditioning charges which would have applied had the requested conditioning been
performed. If, however, the LST does not resolve the reported trouble and the trouble is determined to be
an AT&T-12STATE network-related problem, then CLEC will not be charged the LST rate or for AT&T-
12STATE’s resolution of the trouble. If, however, the trouble is found not to be an AT&T-12STATE network-
related problem, then CLEC shall pay the Maintenance of Service charges referenced in the Pricing
Schedule, in addition to the applicable LST charge.
3.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
3.1 Loop Makeup Information and Ordering:
3.1.1 At the CLEC’s request, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to its Loop
makeup information as it exists in AT&T-21STATE’s database and records via:
3.1.1.1 a mechanized Loop makeup for near real-time access to data available electronically; or
3.1.1.2 manual Loop makeup for information that may not be available electronically.
3.1.2 CLEC will be given nondiscriminatory access to the same Loop makeup information that AT&T-21STATE is

3.3.4 AT&T-21STATE will not modify a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop in such a way that it no longer meets the
technical parameters of the original 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop type e.g., voice grade, etc., being ordered.
3.3.5 In AT&T-12STATE (i) If load coils, repeaters or excessive bridged tap are present on a loop less than
12,000 feet in actual loop length, conditioning to remove these elements will be performed without request;
(ii) if the loop qualification indicates conditioning is available on a loop that is 12,000 feet in actual loop
length or greater, CLEC may request that no conditioning be performed or that AT&T-12STATE perform
some or all of the available loop conditioning to remove excessive bridged tap, load coils and/or repeaters at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may obtain loop conditioning information according to the
terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online website; incorporated herein by reference, as

3.3.7 For any copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop being ordered by CLEC which has over six thousand (6,000) feet
of combined bridged tap will be modified, upon request from CLEC, so that the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
will have a maximum of six thousand (6,000) feet of bridged tap. This modification will be performed at no
additional charge to CLEC. In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE loop conditioning orders that require
the removal of bridged tap that serves no network design purpose on a copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
that will result in a combined total of bridged tap between two thousand five hundred (2,500) and six
thousand (6,000) feet will be performed at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may request
removal of any unnecessary and non-Excessive bridged tap (bridged tap between zero (0) and two
thousand five hundred (2,500) feet which serves no network design purpose), at rates pursuant to AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Special Construction (SC) Process, (which is a part of the service
inquiry process), as mutually agreed to by the Parties.
3.3.8 If CLEC requests Unbundled Loop Modification (ULM) on a reserved facility for a new 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop order, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE may perform a pair change and provision a different

Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9 STATE will provide LMU detail of the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
provisioned.
3.3.9 CLEC shall request 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop make up information pursuant to this Attachment prior to
submitting a Service Inquiry, in accordance to the terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online
website, and/or a Local Service Request (LSR) for the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop type that CLEC desires
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE to condition.
3.3.10 When requesting ULM for a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has
previously provisioned for CLEC, CLEC will submit a Service Inquiry to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE. If a spare 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility that meets the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop modification
specifications requested by CLEC is available at the location for which the ULM was requested, CLEC will
have the option to change the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility to the qualifying spare facility rather than to
provide ULM. In the event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE changes the 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop facility in lieu of providing ULM, CLEC will not be charged for ULM but will only be charged the service
order charges for submitting an order.
3.4 Loops and Subloops available under this Attachment are further identified in the Pricing Schedule and AT&T CLEC
Online website.

Peerless Network
Version: 3Q08 – CLEC ICA 07/01/08
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Coordinated Hot Cut (CHC) provided by AT&T-13STATE and for
Order Coordination (OC) and Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) provided by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Conversion of Service” means the matching of the disconnect of one Telecommunications product or service with
the installation of another Telecommunications product or service.
2.2 “Designated Installation” means an installation of service occurring at a specific time of day as specified.
3.0 CHC and OC (CHC/OC) Service Description
3.1 CHC/OC is an optional manual service offering that permits CLEC to request a Designated Installation and/or
Conversion of Service during or after normal business hours.
3.2 CHC/OC allows the Parties to coordinate the installation of the SL2 Loops (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE),
Unbundled Digital Loops and other Loops where CHC/OC may be purchased as an option, to CLEC’s facilities in
order to limit the time an End User may be without service. CHC/OC is available when the Loop is provisioned over
an existing circuit that is currently providing service to the End User. CHC/OC for physical conversions will be
scheduled at AT&T-22STATE’s discretion during normal working hours on the committed due date.
3.3 CLEC will initiate the beginning of a CHC/OC by contacting the appropriate coordination center. This special request
enables CLEC to schedule and coordinate particular provisioning requirements with AT&T-22STATE.
3.4 AT&T-22STATE may limit the number of service orders that can be coordinated based on workload and resources
available. AT&T-22STATE shall approve the CHC/OC request on a non-discriminatory basis, by requesting carrier,
and on a first come first served basis.
3.5 AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to suspend the availability of CHC/OC service during unanticipated heavy
workload/activity periods. Heavy workload includes any unanticipated volume of work that impacts AT&T-
22STATE’s ability to provide its baseline service. Where time permits, AT&T-22STATE will make every effort to
notify CLEC when such unanticipated activities occur.
4.0 CHC/OC Pricing
4.1 CHC/OC is a time sensitive labor operation. Total charges are determined by a number of factors including the
volume of lines, day of the week, and the time of day requested for the coordinated cut.
4.2 When CLEC orders CHC/OC service, AT&T-22STATE shall charge and CLEC agrees to pay for CHC/OC service at
the “additional labor” or “Time and Material” rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
4.3 In the event AT&T-22STATE fails to meet a CHC/OC service commitment for reasons within the control of AT&T-
22STATE, AT&T-22STATE will not charge CLEC a CHC/OC service charge. However, in the event AT&T-
22STATE misses a CHC/OC service commitment due to reasons outside of AT&T-22STATE’s control, including but
not limited to actions of CLEC, its agent or End User, the CHC/OC service charge will still apply. For example, if
CLEC requests any change to an order with CHC/OC service including, but not limited to, no access to the CLEC’s
End User’s premises, or CLEC/End User not ready to proceed with the order, the CHC/OC service charge will apply
and AT&T-22STATE will not be obligated to ensure a CHC/OC for that order.
5.0 Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Only
5.1 OC-TS is a chargeable option for all Loops except Unbundled Copper Loops (UCL) and is billed in addition to the OC
charge. CLEC may specify a time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (local time) Monday through Friday, excluding
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s holidays. If CLEC specifies a time outside this window, or selects a time
or quantity of loops that requires AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE technicians to work outside normal work
hours, overtime charges will apply in addition to the OC and OC-TS charges. Overtime charges will be applied

based on the amount of overtime worked and in accordance with the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. The OC-
TS charges for an order due on the same day at the same location will be applied on a per LSR basis.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Resale Services provided by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC.
1.2 To the extent required by Section 251(c)(4) of the Act, AT&T-22STATE shall make available to CLEC for resale at
wholesale rates Telecommunications Services that AT&T-22STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not
Telecommunications Carriers.
1.3 Each state-specific avoided cost discount applicable to rates paid by CLEC for the resale of Telecommunications
Services is referred to herein as a Resale Discount. Where available, Resale Discounts are listed in the Pricing
Schedule; if not listed in the Pricing Schedule, the Resale Discount(s) and/or rate(s) as stated or reflected in the
applicable Tariff shall apply.
1.4 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific Tariff(s) shall govern the terms, conditions and
charges associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, with the exception of any
resale restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply.
Use limitations shall be in parity with services offered by AT&T-22STATE to its End Users.
1.5 Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is
effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Special Needs Services” means services for the physically disabled as defined in state-specific Tariffs.
2.2 “Tariff” means the most current state-specific retail and, where available, resale tariff(s) and/or Guidebook(s) (the
latter as posted on the AT&T CLEC Online website).
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-22STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are concurrently offered to AT&T-22STATE’s End Users at
retail.
3.2 AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to make services available at the Resale Discount to CLEC for its own use or for
the use of one or more of its parent, Affiliates, subsidiaries or similarly-related entities. CLEC shall not use any
Resale Service to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-22STATE’s corresponding retail Tariff(s).
Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Service to provide access or interconnection services to itself,
interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), or other Telecommunications
providers; provided, however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local Exchange telephone service to
access IXCs, wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers.
3.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale at the Resale Discount pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of
the state-specific retail Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that End User’s existing location, both at the time of grandfathering.

3.4 CLEC shall only sell Plexar , Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is being

Peerless Network
Version: 1Q09 – CLEC ICA 03/23/09
3.5 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-22STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of a
service by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
3.6 CLEC shall only resell services provided under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to whom AT&T-
22STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).
3.6.1 Where available for Resale in accordance with state-specific Tariffs, CLEC may resell Special Needs
Services and/or low income assistance services (e.g., LifeLine and Link-Up) to End Users who are eligible
for each such service. To the extent CLEC resells services that require certification on the part of the End
User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as
established by the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
3.7 When ordering services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-22STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original end user service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End Users for such offering or promotion. AT&T-22STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each promotion
per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
3.8 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for Resale, whether
at the Resale Discount or otherwise; provided, however, that AT&T-22STATE shall offer Short-Term Promotions for
Resale at no Resale Discount in a particular state if and only to the extent required by Commission order in that
state.
3.9 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this
Attachment.
3.10 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local Exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
3.11 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have thirty (30)
calendar days to correct the violation and notify AT&T-22STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected.
AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC a sum equal to:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for
the stated violation; and
(ii) the actual revenues CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation, whichever
is greater.
Should CLEC dispute the stated violation, CLEC must notify AT&T-22STATE in writing of the specific details and
reasons for its dispute within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Resale Notice from AT&T-22STATE and
comply with the Dispute Resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions (“GT&C”) of the Agreement
(“Dispute Resolution provisions”). Resolution of any dispute under this Attachment shall also be conducted in
compliance with the Dispute Resolution provisions in the GT&C.
3.12 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption (or
resale to similarly-situated end users) of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof (including, without limitation, the wholesale discount, if any,

associated with such resale). Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by both Parties and
approval by the Commission(s).
3.13 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-22STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-22STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-22STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
4.0 Responsibilities of Parties
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-22STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-22STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations, and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.
4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-22STATE is free to reclaim the End
User or process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-22STATE maintenance
center(s) twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, or otherwise shall be in parity with the ability offered
by AT&T-22STATE to its End Users. CLEC will be assigned Maintenance Center(s) when CLEC’s initial service
agreements are made. CLEC End Users calling AT&T-22STATE will be referred to CLEC at the telephone
number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to authorize CLEC to repair,
maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-22STATE’s network facilities, including without limitation those on End User
premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ activation of Call Trace and annoying call complaints shall be handled by the AT&T-22STATE
operations centers responsible for handling such requests. AT&T-22STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End
Users to provide call records to the proper authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case
involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through
CLEC. AT&T-22STATE shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against
any claim, loss or damage arising from providing this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the
corrective action necessary with its End User who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-
22STATE taking corrective action, up to and including disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-22STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-22STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the GT&C’s of the Agreement.
5.0 Billing and Payment of Rates and Charges
5.1 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Attachment, including
but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.

messages) received by AT&T-22STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as
unbillable and will not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those
messages to the carrier indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be
billed by AT&T-22STATE.
5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall not be responsible for the manner in which utilization of Resale Services or the associated
charges are allocated to End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC
under this Attachment will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for calling card, collect, or third number
billed calls (Alternately Billed Traffic or “ABT”) or toll and information services (for example, 900 calls), CLEC
must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this Attachment and pay any
applicable charges. It is the responsibility of CLEC to order the appropriate toll restriction or blocking on
lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for certain types of calls,
including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Express Call Completion. Depending on
the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may bypass
blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any charges
associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that bypass
blocking systems.

1.0 Pricing Schedule
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the pricing terms and conditions. The rate tables included in this Attachment may be
divided into categories. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any
of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
1.2 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
1.2.1 Certain of the current rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established by
the Commission (“Commission-established “Current Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement that are
not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.2, or that are not marked as interim or as
“TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Current Rates. If, during the Term
of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Current Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable (i.e. not an order
or docket relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration) to the
Interconnection Services, either Party may provide written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party,
after the effective date of such order, that it wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim
Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and supersede the Commission-established Current Rate(s) already
set forth in this Agreement. Following such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for
any written amendment or further Commission action, CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC shall pay) the Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Section 1.2.1.1
below and Section 1.2.1.3 below, and the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as
provided in Section 1.2.1.1 below and Section 1.2.1.3 below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a
conforming amendment which shall reflect that the Commission-established Current Rate(s) were replaced
by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval. In addition, as
soon as is reasonably practicable after such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party
any adjustments that are necessary to reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the
Parties as provided:
1.2.1.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective
date of any such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the
effective date of the order, and AT&T-22STATE will issue any adjustments that are appropriate
(e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified
Rate(s) with the Commission-established current Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of
the order, in accordance herewith.
1.2.1.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.2.1.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.2 above, but not within
ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be
deemed effective between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified
Rate(s) into the Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is
approved or is deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, on a
prospective basis only, upon the amendment effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further,
the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established
Current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) if the terms and conditions of this Section 1.2 above were
not part of an approved and effective agreement between the Parties at the time the order became
effective, either Party may still give a Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be
effective as of the date the Parties’ Agreement (containing this Section 1.2,) becomes effective
(following the date the Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the

Commission) and shall apply, beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis
only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Commission-established current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.2 above.
1.3 Replacement of Interim Rates
1.3.1 Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Interconnection Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party
may, within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written
notice (“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the new Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Interim Rate counterpart(s) in this
Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any formal amendment or
further Commission action, AT&T-22STATE will update CLEC's billing tables to replace the Current Interim
Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the Replacement Rate Notice.
Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect such Replacement Rates and
shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.3.2 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such
order, then the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T-22STATE
will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments)
to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Interim Rates for the period after the effective date
of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.3.3 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the Interim
Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.3.4 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.3 above, but not within ninety (90)
calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is deemed to
have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective date, on a
prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of such
amendment.
1.3.5 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.3 above were not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply, beginning
on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from
replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period
prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above.
1.4 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.4.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Pricing Schedule and Agreement, in the event that any other
CLEC should seek to adopt the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the
Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the current and/or interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of
the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become effective between AT&T-22STATE and the Adopting
CLEC (i.e. following the date the Commission approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting
CLEC’s Section 252(i) adoption (“MFN Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this

Agreement shall entitle an Adopting CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement
to any date prior to the MFN Effective Date and any adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such
claim hereunder.
1.4.2 AT&T-22STATE obligation, under this Agreement, per the GT&C is to only provide Interconnection Services
for which complete rates, terms and conditions are contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent
CLEC orders a product or service for which there are not complete rates, terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE may reject the order. CLEC must amend this Agreement to allow ordering
of products and services for which complete rates, terms and conditions did not exist as of the Effective
Date of the Agreement to the extent such product or service is still available at the time of the request. In
the event that CLEC orders, and AT&T-22STATE provisions, a product or service to CLEC for which there
are not complete rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees that
one of the following will occur:
1.4.3 CLEC shall pay for the product or service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s
applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the product or service or, to the extent there are no tariff rates, terms or
conditions available for the product or service in the applicable state, then CLEC shall pay for the product or
service at AT&T-22STATE’s current generic contract rate for the product or service set forth in AT&T-
22STATE’s applicable state-specific generic Pricing Schedule as published on the AT&T CLEC Online
website; or
1.4.4 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.4.3 above, and AT&T-
22STATE may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of the product or
service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement as set
forth in this Section 1.4.2 above. If CLEC and AT&T-22STATE cannot agree on rates, terms, and
conditions either Party may institute the Dispute Resolution provisions as contained in the GT&Cs.
1.4.5 AT&T-22STATE’s provisioning of orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.4.2 above, and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-22STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such products and/or services.
1.4.6 Where the rate for an AT&T-22STATE Interconnection Service is identified as a tariffed rate, any changes
to the tariff rate shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement. The issuance of a Commission
Order approving such rate change shall be the only Notice required under this Agreement. Provided
however, should a tariff or tariff rate, incorporated into this Agreement, be withdrawn or invalidated in any
way during the term of this Agreement, the last rate in effect at the time of such withdrawal or invalidation
shall continue to apply during the remaining term of this Agreement.
1.4.7 The Resale Discount applicable to purchases of Resold Services in each State is the current Commission-
approved rate. Any Commission approved or ordered change in the Resale discount for Resold Services
shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement for the state in which such Commission approves or
orders the change. The issuance of the Commission Order approving such change shall be the only Notice
required under this Agreement.
1.5 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.5.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or "TBD" or no rate is
shown, the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T-
22STATE for that Interconnection Service and incorporated into AT&T-22STATE’s current state-specific
Generic Pricing Schedule as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website, that rate(s) (“Established Rate”)
shall automatically apply to the Interconnection Service provided under this Agreement back to the Effective
Date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T-22STATE provisioned for that
Interconnection Service without the need for any additional modification(s) to this Agreement or further
Commission action. AT&T-22STATE shall provide Written Notice to CLEC of the application of the rate,

price or charge that has been established, and the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate, and the Established Rate will be deemed effective between the
Parties as of the Effective Date of the Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment
which shall reflect the Established Rate that applies to such Product or Service pursuant to this Section 1.5
above, and shall submit such Amendment to the State Commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is
reasonably practicable after such Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T-22STATE shall bill CLEC to
reflect the application of the Established Rate retroactively to the Effective Date of the Agreement between
the Parties.
1.5.2 AT&T-22STATE’s provisioning of such orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.5 above and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-22STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such Interconnection Services.
1.6 Recurring Charges
1.6.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Tables, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be defined
as a thirty (30) day calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Interconnection Services will
be one (1) month. After the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The
minimum term for Interconnection Services, if applicable, will be specified in the rate tables included in this
Attachment.
1.6.2 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T-22STATE will first compute the mileage using the
V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No 4.
When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T-22STATE will round up to the next whole mile
before determining the mileage and applying rates.
1.7 Non-Recurring Charges:
1.7.1 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“non-recurring charges.”
1.7.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there may be non-recurring charges for each 251(c)(3) UNE.
1.7.3 When CLEC converts an End-User currently receiving non-complex service from AT&T-22STATE, without
any facilities rearrangements to AT&T-22STATE’s network, the normal service order charges and/or
nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
1.7.4 CLEC shall pay the applicable service order processing/administration charge for each service order
submitted by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement,
change, or record order.
1.7.5 In some cases, Commissions have ordered AT&T-22STATE to separate disconnect costs and installation
costs into two separate nonrecurring charges. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted in this Agreement, the
Commission-ordered disconnect charges will be applied at the time the disconnect activity is performed by
AT&T-22STATE, regardless of whether or not a disconnect order is issued by CLEC.
1.7.6 Time and Material charges (a.k.a. additional labor charges) are defined in the Price Schedule contained
herein.
1.7.7 Loop Zone charges are defined in the Price Schedule contained herein.

NOTE: (2) Any element that can be ordered electronically will be billed according to the SOMEC rate listed in this category. Please refer to AT&T's Local Ordering Handbook (LOH) to determine if a product can be ordered electronically. For those elements that cannot be
ordered electronically at present per the LOH, the listed SOMEC rate in this category reflects the charge that would be billed to a CLEC once electronic ordering capabilities come on-line for that element. Otherwise, the manual ordering charge, SOMAN, will be applied to a
CLECs bill when it submits an LSR to AT&T.

NOTE: (2) Any element that can be ordered electronically will be billed according to the SOMEC rate listed in this category. Please refer to AT&T's Local Ordering Handbook (LOH) to determine if a product can be ordered electronically. For those elements that cannot be
ordered electronically at present per the LOH, the listed SOMEC rate in this category reflects the charge that would be billed to a CLEC once electronic ordering capabilities come on-line for that element. Otherwise, the manual ordering charge, SOMAN, will be applied to a
CLECs bill when it submits an LSR to AT&T.

STRUCTURE ACCESS
NOTE: Urban and non-urban are defined by the Bureau of Census as follows: Urban is a city plus the closely-settled urban fringe that together have a minimum population of 50,000. Non-urban is less than 50,000.
Conduit rates will apply to each passageway (innerduct).

NOTE: (1) CLEC should contact its contract negotiator if it prefers the "state specific" OSS charges as ordered by the State Commissions. The OSS charges currently contained in this rate exhibit are the AT&T "regional" service ordering charges. CLEC may elect either the
state specific Commission ordered rates for the service ordering charges, or CLEC may elect the regional service ordering charge, however, CLEC can not obtain a mixture of the two regardless if CLEC has a interconnection contract established in each of the 9 states.

NOTE: (2) Any element that can be ordered electronically will be billed according to the SOMEC rate listed in this category. Please refer to AT&T's Local Ordering Handbook (LOH) to determine if a product can be ordered electronically. For those elements that cannot be
ordered electronically at present per the LOH, the listed SOMEC rate in this category reflects the charge that would be billed to a CLEC once electronic ordering capabilities come on-line for that element. Otherwise, the manual ordering charge, SOMAN, will be applied to a
CLECs bill when it submits an LSR to AT&T.

NOTE: (2) Any element that can be ordered electronically will be billed according to the SOMEC rate listed in this category. Please refer to AT&T's Local Ordering Handbook (LOH) to determine if a product can be ordered electronically. For those elements that cannot be
ordered electronically at present per the LOH, the listed SOMEC rate in this category reflects the charge that would be billed to a CLEC once electronic ordering capabilities come on-line for that element. Otherwise, the manual ordering charge, SOMAN, will be applied to a
CLECs bill when it submits an LSR to AT&T.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit A sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI,
AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS acts as a Transit Service
Provider (“AT&T-TSP”) for CLEC. Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for
Telecommunications Traffic that does not originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic
Service allows CLEC to exchange CLEC originated traffic with a Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is
not directly interconnected, and it allows CLEC to receive traffic originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP offers Transit Traffic Services to interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange Local
Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit A. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit A. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit A, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO,
AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit Traffic
Services to CLEC and Third Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA - 02/12/14
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,
nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, if CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch

subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.
6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T
MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS, the same facilities and trunking (ordering,
provisioning, servicing, etc.) used to route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
6.5 In AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning,
servicing, etc.) used for transit trunk groups will be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements.
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T INDIANA, and/or, AT&T OHIO only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T INDIANA, and/or AT&T OHIO, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local and
IntraLATA toll minutes of use. CLEC agrees to compensate AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T CONNECTICUT,
AT&T INDIANA and/or AT&T OHIO as a transit service provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in
the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.2 AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS only
8.2.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T ARKANSAS,
AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA
and/or AT&T TEXAS, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local minutes of use only. CLEC agrees to compensate
AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
NORTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TEXAS as a Transit Service Provider for the rate elements at the rate set
forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.3 AT&T MISSOURI only
8.3.1 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, the Transit Traffic rate
elements shall not apply to MCA Traffic (i.e., no transiting charges shall be assessed for MCA Traffic) for
AT&T MISSOURI.
8.4 AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA only
8.4.1 Traffic between CLEC and Wireless Type 1 Third Parties or Wireless Type 2A Third Parties that do not
engage in Meet Point Billing with AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA shall not be treated
as Transit Traffic from a routing or billing perspective until such time as such traffic is identifiable as Transit
Traffic.
8.4.2 CLEC shall send all IntraLATA toll traffic to be terminated by an independent telephone company to the End
User’s IntraLATA toll provider and shall not send such traffic to AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA as Transit Traffic. IntraLATA toll traffic shall be any traffic that originates outside of the
terminating independent telephone company’s local calling area.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit A sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS acts as a Transit Service Provider (“AT&T-
TSP”) for CLEC. Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic
that does not originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to
exchange CLEC originated traffic with a Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly
interconnected, and it allows CLEC to receive traffic originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier. AT&T-TSP offers
Transit Traffic Services to interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange Local Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit A. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit A. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit A, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
NORTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit Traffic Services to CLEC and Third
Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA - 02/12/14
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,
nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, if CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch

subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.
6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO,
AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.)
used to route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
6.5 In AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning,
servicing, etc.) used for transit trunk groups will be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, and/or, AT&T OHIO only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, and/or AT&T OHIO, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local and IntraLATA toll minutes of use.
CLEC agrees to compensate AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA and/or AT&T OHIO as a transit service
provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.

AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
NORTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TEXAS as a Transit Service Provider for the rate elements at the rate set
forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.3 AT&T MISSOURI only
8.3.1 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, the Transit Traffic rate
elements shall not apply to MCA Traffic (i.e., no transiting charges shall be assessed for MCA Traffic) for
AT&T MISSOURI.
8.4 AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA only
8.4.1 Traffic between CLEC and Wireless Type 1 Third Parties or Wireless Type 2A Third Parties that do not
engage in Meet Point Billing with AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA shall not be treated
as Transit Traffic from a routing or billing perspective until such time as such traffic is identifiable as Transit
Traffic.
8.4.2 CLEC shall send all IntraLATA toll traffic to be terminated by an independent telephone company to the End
User’s IntraLATA toll provider and shall not send such traffic to AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA as Transit Traffic. IntraLATA toll traffic shall be any traffic that originates outside of the
terminating independent telephone company’s local calling area.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit A sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS acts as a Transit Service Provider (“AT&T-
TSP”) for CLEC. Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic
that does not originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to
exchange CLEC originated traffic with a Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly
interconnected, and it allows CLEC to receive traffic originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier. AT&T-TSP offers
Transit Traffic Services to interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange Local Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit A. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit A. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit A, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
NORTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit Traffic Services to CLEC and Third
Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA - 02/12/14
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,
nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, if CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch

subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.
6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO,
AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.)
used to route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
6.5 In AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning,
servicing, etc.) used for transit trunk groups will be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, and/or, AT&T OHIO only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, and/or AT&T OHIO, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local and IntraLATA toll minutes of use.
CLEC agrees to compensate AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA and/or AT&T OHIO as a transit service
provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.2 AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA and/or AT&T TEXAS only
8.2.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T ARKANSAS,
AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA
and/or AT&T TEXAS, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local minutes of use only. CLEC agrees to compensate
AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T
NORTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TEXAS as a Transit Service Provider for the rate elements at the rate set
forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.3 AT&T MISSOURI only
8.3.1 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, the Transit Traffic rate
elements shall not apply to MCA Traffic (i.e., no transiting charges shall be assessed for MCA Traffic) for
AT&T MISSOURI.
8.4 AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA only
8.4.1 Traffic between CLEC and Wireless Type 1 Third Parties or Wireless Type 2A Third Parties that do not
engage in Meet Point Billing with AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA shall not be treated
as Transit Traffic from a routing or billing perspective until such time as such traffic is identifiable as Transit
Traffic.
8.4.2 CLEC shall send all IntraLATA toll traffic to be terminated by an independent telephone company to the End
User’s IntraLATA toll provider and shall not send such traffic to AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA as Transit Traffic. IntraLATA toll traffic shall be any traffic that originates outside of the
terminating independent telephone company’s local calling area.

bypass blocking systems.

Version: 11/18/15
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit B sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA,
AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS acts as a Transit Service Provider (“AT&T-TSP”) for CLEC.
Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic that does not
originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to exchange CLEC
originated traffic with a Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly interconnected, and it allows
CLEC to receive traffic originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier. AT&T-TSP offers Transit Traffic Services to
interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange Local Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit B. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit B. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit B, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T
INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit Traffic Services to CLEC and Third Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Page 487 of 532

Contract Id: 4822368
Transit Traffic Service Exhibit B - ICA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 5
Page 19 of 53 Peerless Network
Version: 11/18/15
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,
nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, if CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch
subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit

Transit Traffic Service Exhibit B - ICA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 5
Page 20 of 53 Peerless Network
Version: 11/18/15
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.
6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T
OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.) used to
route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
6.5 In AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning,
servicing, etc.) used for transit trunk groups will be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements.
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, and/or, AT&T OHIO only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, and/or AT&T OHIO, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local and IntraLATA toll minutes of use.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.
Page 492 of 532

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 24 of 53
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
Page 493 of 532

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 25 of 53
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect
Page 494 of 532

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 26 of 53
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.
Page 495 of 532

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 27 of 53
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users, non-discriminatory access to
listings, as described herein.
4.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will meet state requirements to make available listings through itself or a contracted vendor
to provide listings for its ILEC Territory, as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.2.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-
Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs
and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not provide a resale discount for
any listings.

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 28 of 53
4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 Distribution of Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy per primary End
User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages directory in the
same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-21STATE’s
subscribers.
4.2.4 AT&T-21STATE shall direct its publishing vendor to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the “Information
Pages”, or comparable section of its white pages directories (covering the territory where CLEC is certified
to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair, customer service and
billing information.
4.2.5 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.5.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
4.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber
Page 497 of 532

Page 29 of 53
list information and the subscriber list information of other companies that have authorized a similar
release of their subscriber list information by AT&T-21STATE.
4.2.6 CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE and/or its Affiliates as a result of CLEC not
complying with the terms of this Attachment.

to represent their relationship as any form of agency, partnership or joint venture.

4.2.8.1 If either Party is found to have materially breached the Listings terms of this Attachment, the non-
breaching Party may terminate the Listings terms of this Attachment by providing written Notice to

Affiliates and vendor as a result of such CLEC breach.

shall pay AT&T-21STATE, within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of any bills by AT&T-21STATE,
all amounts due for actual services provided under this Attachment, plus estimated monthly charges for the
remainder of the term. Estimated charges will be based on an average of the actual monthly amounts billed
by AT&T-21STATE pursuant to this Attachment prior to its termination. The rates applicable for determining
the amount(s) under the terms outlined in this Section are those specified in the Pricing Sheet.
