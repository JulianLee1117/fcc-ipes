Voyant hereby states as follows:
1. Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment is sought
Voyant seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A submitted with the Application.
2. Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information was
submitted or a description of the circumstances giving rise to the submission
Voyant is submitting Exhibit A, an agreement between Voyant and its carrier partner, as
proof of facilities readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or
contains a trade secret or is privileged
Exhibit A contains proprietary commercial information concerning the operations, term,
and obligations of Voyant services in order to obtain the services of its carrier partner.
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that is subject
to competition
Exhibit A contains sensitive and proprietary information, as well as detailed operational
information that Voyant’s iVoIP competitors and others could use to disadvantage Voyant.
Disclosure of the information contained in Exhibit A therefore would cause substantial
competitive harm.
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial
competitive harm
Competitors could use the information in Exhibit A to cause substantial competitive harm
by using it to gain access to sensitive and proprietary information about how Voyant provides
services as well as about Voyant’s commercial agreements with others that are not ordinarily
disclosed to the public.
6. Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent
unauthorized disclosure
Voyant has not publicly disclosed the agreement which is provided as Exhibit A and has
only made the information contained therein known to those employees and partners necessary
for the carrying out of Voyant’s services.
7. Identification of whether the information is available to the public and the extent of
any previous disclosure of the information to third parties
Voyant has not publicly disclosed the contents of Exhibit A.

Public Version
8. Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that material
should not be available for public disclosure
Voyant requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in Exhibit A that would cause
immediate and future competitive harms.
9. Any other information that the party seeking confidential treatment believes may be
useful in assessing whether its request for confidentiality should be granted
The information for which Voyant seeks confidential treatment relates to its operations
and private agreements with its carrier partner. Disclosure of such information would harm both
Voyant and Voyant’s carrier partner.
Please direct any questions regarding this filing to the undersigned.

any rate(s), term(s) and/or condition(s) (“Provisions”) of the Agreement and this Amendment
and/or otherwise affects the rights or obligations of either Party that are addressed by the
Agreement and this Amendment, specifically including but not limited to those arising with
respect to the Government Actions, the affected Provision(s) shall be immediately invalidated,

25. SEVERABILITY
*represents a Non-Voluntary Arrangement.
Page 19 of 695

Public Version
3. As the Terms are being adopted by you pursuant to your statutory rights under
section 252(i), Verizon does not provide the Terms to you as either a voluntary or
negotiated agreement. The filing and performance by Verizon of the Terms does
not in any way constitute a waiver by Verizon of any position as to the Terms or a
portion thereof, nor does it constitute a waiver by Verizon of all rights and
remedies it may have to seek review of the Terms, or to petition the Commission,
other administrative body, or court for reconsideration or reversal of any
determination made by the Commission pursuant to arbitration in Docket No. 01-
C-0095, or to seek review in any way of any provisions included in these Terms
as a result of NTI's 252(i) election.
4. Nothing herein shall be construed as or is intended to be a concession or admission
by Verizon t�at any contractual provision required by the Commission in Docket
No. 01-C-0095 (the AT&T arbitration) or any provision in the Terms complies with
• the rights and duties imposed by the Act, the decisions of the FCC and the
Commissions, the decisions of the courts, or other law, and Verizon expressly
reserves its full right to assert and pursue claims arising from or related to the
Terms.
5. Verizon reserves the right to deny NTI's adoption and/or application of the
Terms, in whole or in part, at any time:
(a) when the costs of providing the Terms to NTI are greater than the costs of
providing them to AT&T;
(b) if the provision of the Terms to NTI is not technically feasible; and/or
(c ) to the extent that Verizon otherwise is not required to make the Terms
available to NTI under applicable law.
6. For avoidance of doubt, please note that adoption of the Terms will not result in
•
reciprocal compensation payments for Internet traffic. Verizon has always taken
the position that reciprocal compensation was not due to be paid for Internet
traffic under section 251 (b) (5) of the Act. Verizon' s position that reciprocal
compensation is not to be paid for Internet traffic was confirmed by the FCC in
the Order on Remand and Report and Order adopted on April 18, 2001 ("FCC
Internet Order"), which held that Internet traffic constitutes "information access"
outside the scope of the reciprocal compensation obligations set forth in section
25 l(b)(5) of the Act.1 Accordingly, any compensation to be paid for Internet
traffic will be handled pursuant to the terms of the FCC Internet Order, not
pursuant to adoption of the Terms. 2 Moreover, in light of the FCC Internet

22.0 TERM AND TERMINATION; DEFAULT
22.1 This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first above written and,
unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, shall continue in effect
until June 23, 2005 (the "Initial Term"), and thereafter the Agreement shall continue in
force and effect on a month-to-month basis unless and until terminated as provided
herein.
22.2 [Intentionally deleted]
·22.3 Either AT&T or Verizon may terminate this Agreement, effective upon
the expiration of the Initial Term or effective upon any date after expiration of the Initial
Term, by providing written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days, but not greater
than nine (9) months, in advance of the date of termination. In the event of such
termination, if neither Party has requested renegotiation of a successor interconnection
agreement pursuant to Section 22.4, the service arrangements made available under this
Agreement and existing at the time of termination shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, continue without interruption under (a) standard Interconnection terms and
conditions approved and made generally effective by the Commission, (b) Tariff terms
and conditions generally available to CLECs or (c ) if none of the above is available,
under the terms of this Agreement on a month-to-month basis until such time as a new
agreement is entered into, or if no agreement is entered into, until (a) or (b) becomes
available.
22.4 AT&T (i) may make, at its option, nine (9) months prior to the expiration
of the Initial Term, or (ii) shall make, at Verizon's request, but no earlier than nine (9)
month prior to the end of the Initial Term, a written request to Verizon to renegotiate the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 251(c)(l) of the Act ("Request for
Renegotiation"). The date of receipt of such Request for Renegotiation shall be the
"Renegotiation Request Date". Any such Request for Renegotiation shall be deemed by
both Parties to be notice of termination of this Agreement and a good faith request for
Interconnection pursuant to Section 252 of the Act ( or any successor provision). The
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in effect during the period of
renegotiations; provided, however, if the Parties do not execute a new interconnection
agreement within one hundred and sixty (160) days after the Renegotiation Request Date�
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect only if
AT&T files an arbitration petition pursuant to Section 252(b) of the Act, in which case,
this Agreement shall remain in effect until the Parties execute a successor agreement.
22.4.1 If either Party defaults in the payment of any amount due
hereunder, except for amounts subject to a bona fide dispute pursuant to Section 28.9
hereof with respect to which the disputing party has complied with the requirements of
