hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via first-class mail.
VoIP Stir respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant
confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a document that contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”).1 VoIP Stir, LLC. is voluntarily providing this information, “of a kind that would
customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under
FOIA.2 Moreover, VoIP Stir would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 VoIP
Stir hereby states as follows:

Competitors could use VoIP Stir’s proprietary commercial and operational information
to VoIP Stir’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how

others in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
