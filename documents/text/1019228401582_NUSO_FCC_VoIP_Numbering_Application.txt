REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of NUSO, LLC; Application of NUSO, LLC for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 20-.
Dear Secretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, NUSO, LLC ("NUSO") hereby submits its
application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
NUSO respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's rules, 47
C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").1
NUSO is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, NUSO would suffer
substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
u.s.c.

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459{b) of the Commission's rules4 , NUSO
hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.5
NUSO seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
NUSO is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier partner, as proof of
NUSO's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15{g){3){i){D) of the Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which NUSO seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors"8 • Exhibit A describes the
agreement between NUSO and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning NUSO's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to NUSO's disadvantage. NUSO has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet Protocol
{"VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial information of
the type provided by NUSO could compromise NUSO's position in this highly competitive
industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to NUSO.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use NUSO's proprietary commercial and operational information to NUSO's
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how NUSO provides services
as well as about NUSO's commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
NUSO has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
1. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
NUSO has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
NUSO requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period is
necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.

9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT NUSO BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns NUSO's proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3006 or
