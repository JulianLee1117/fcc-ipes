increased cost of managing the SS7 network, it wishes to transition to being an Interconnected VOIP Provider

and lease PSTN Connection Services through their PSTN Host Provider. DayStarr currently operates in the 344,
346, and 348 LATAs and intends to begin implementing its Interconnected VOIP network in those Michigan
LATAs.
