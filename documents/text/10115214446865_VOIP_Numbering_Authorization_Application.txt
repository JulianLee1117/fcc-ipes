and activation of numbering resources. Please see Appendix-A for reference.

These measures ensure that assigned numbering resources can be placed into service promptly and efficiently.
4. Authority to Operate in New Hampshire
The company intends to provide VoIP and IP-enabled telecommunications services, including SIP trunking

The company relies on the guidance of the New Hampshire Department of Energy, which states that:

for VoIP and IP-enabled service providers and that no state-level registration, certification, or authorization is
required as a prerequisite to commencing such operations in New Hampshire.
As a result, the company is legally permitted to begin operations immediately upon the activation of numbering

reference, please see Appendix-C.

Information for Telecommunications Providers
The New Hampshire Department of Energy has limited regulatory authority over the telecommunications industry.
State law and rules require excepted local exchange carriers (ELECs) to register with the Department of Energy. ELECs include all incumbent
local exchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, intrastate toll providers, pay phone providers, and any other provider of
telecommunications voice services, with the exception of those providers of telephone service to customers using VoIP or IP-enabled
technology. VoIP or IP-enabled providers may voluntarily register with the Department to obtain evidence of their rights and obligations under
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
The Department does not regulate providers of wireless or cellular phone service, providers of VoIP or IP-enabled service, out-of-state long-
distance service, or internet or broadband service.
The Department administers telephone numbering resources, striving to preserve New Hampshire's 603 area code, sets standards for utility
pole attachments, and may monitor relationships between telephone utilities for compliance with federal and state requirements for carrier
interconnection and accessibility on nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions.
