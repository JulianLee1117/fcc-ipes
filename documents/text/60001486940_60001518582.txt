Note: This list includes all the states that have rate centers in the LATAs that Vonage has
targeted for its initial rollout of direct access. Because some LATAs have rate centers outside
the primary state for the LATA (e.g. Charlotte LATA has a handful of rate centers in South
Carolina), it is unlikely that Vonage will request new numbering resources in all of the states on
this list as part of its initial rollout.
