WITHDRAWAL OF NOBELBIZ, INC.’S APPLICATION FOR
INTERCONNECTED VoIP NUMBERING AUTHORIZATION
On November 10, 2020, NobelBiz, Inc. (“NobelBiz”) filed an Application for
Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization (“Application”) with the Federal Communications
Commission (“Commission” or “FCC”).1 On March 2, 2021, the Commission opened WC Docket
No. 20-385 and placed the Application on non-streamlined review.2 The Application has been
under review by the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States
Telecommunications Services Sector (“Committee”), and NobelBiz has provided complete
responses to the Committee’s requests for information.
At the time of the Application, direct access to numbers was a requirement for NobelBiz
to obtain token access authorization for purposes of deploying the STIR/SHAKEN call
authentication framework. Since that time, however, the Governing Authority has changed its
1 Application of NobelBiz, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources, WC Docket No. 20-385
(filed Nov. 10, 2020).

policy and direct access to numbers is no longer necessary.3 Although NobelBiz initially continued
to pursue its Application before the Commission, upon further consideration of its business needs,
NobelBiz has decided that it does not have a sufficient need for direct access to numbers at this
time to pursue the Application further. Therefore, NobelBiz requests leave to withdraw its
Application and requests that the Commission close WC Docket No. 20-385 as a result.
