RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of AM Communication Labs Inc.;
Application of AM Communication Labs Inc. for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources, WC Docket No. 24-__
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3) of the Commission’s Rules, AM Communication Labs Inc.
(“AM Comm”), hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via FedEx. AM Comm
respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§
0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant confidential treatment to
Exhibit A, a document that contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information, and Exhibit D,
a document that contains financial information. Both documents fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom
of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 AM Comm is voluntarily providing this information, “of a kind that
would customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under
FOIA.2 Moreover, AM Comm would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A and Exhibit D are marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST
FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 AM
Comm hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).
4 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
AM Comm seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A and Exhibit D to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of AM Comm’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules, AM Comm is submitting the agreement between it and its carrier partner as Exhibit
A, and non-public information about the individuals or entities that directly or indirectly own at least 10
percent of the equity of AM Comm as Exhibit D.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which AM Comm seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8 Exhibit A describes
the agreement between AM Comm and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning the operations and pricing of AM Comm’s carrier partner and AM Comm’s
network, services, and operating costs and expenses. Exhibit D lists the individuals or entities that
directly or indirectly own at least 10 percent of the equity of AM Comm with their respective percentage
amounts.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS
A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to AM Comm’s and its CLEC partner’s disadvantage. AM Comm and its CLEC partner have numerous
competitors in the Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which they operate. Detailed
operations and commercial information of the type provided by AM Comm could compromise AM
Comm’s position in this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial
competitive harm to AM Comm, who has contractually committed to maintaining the confidential
treatment of its agreement with its CLEC partner.
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).
8 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457(d) and 0.459.
9 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4).

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use AM Comm’s (or its CLEC partner’s) proprietary commercial and
operational information to AM Comm’s (or its CLEC partner’s) detriment as they would gain access to
sensitive information about how AM Comm provides services as well as about AM Comm’s
commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY
TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
AM Comm has not distributed the information in Exhibit A or Exhibit D to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
AM Comm has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A or Exhibit D to the public
or to third parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY
ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE.13
AM Comm requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A and the confidential
ownership information in Exhibit D.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT AM COMM BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED.14
The information concerns AM Comm’s proprietary network and commercial arrangements
information, related to current and planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is
commercially sensitive.

corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words “include,” “includes” and
“including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation” and/or “but not
limited to”. The words “will” and “shall” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and
the use of either connotes a mandatory requirement. The use of one or the other will not mean a
different degree of right or obligation for either Party. A defined word intended to convey its
special meaning is capitalized when used. Other terms that are capitalized and not defined in
this Agreement will have the meaning in the Act, or in the absence of their inclusion in the Act,
their customary usage in the Telecommunications industry as of the Effective Date.
2.2 Headings Not Controlling
2.2.1 The headings and numbering of Sections, Parts, Appendices Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms
herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Attachments, Exhibits, Schedules and Addenda, constitute the entire Agreement between the
Parties. In order to facilitate use and comprehension of the Agreement, the Appendices have

attachment, exhibit, schedule or addenda may otherwise have.
2.3 Referenced Documents
2.3.1 Unless the context shall otherwise specifically require, and subject to Section 21, whenever any
provision of this Agreement refers to a technical reference, technical publication, CLEC Practice,
SBC-13STATE Practice, any publication of telecommunications industry administrative or
technical standards, or any other document specifically incorporated into this Agreement
(collectively, a “Referenced Instrument”), it will be deemed to be a reference to the then-current
version or edition (including any amendments, supplements, addenda, or successors) of each
Referenced Instrument that is in effect, and will include the then-current version or edition
(including any amendments, supplements, addenda, or successors) of any other Referenced
Instrument incorporated by reference therein.

deemed to be references to Sections, Paragraphs and Parts of, and Exhibits, Schedules and
Appendices to, this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise require.

2.6.1 In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Act, the provisions of
the Act shall govern.
2.6.2 If any definitions, terms or conditions in any given Appendix, Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or
Addenda differ from those contained in the main body of this Agreement, those definitions, terms
or conditions will supersede those contained in the main body of this Agreement, but only in
regard to the services or activities listed in that particular Appendix, Attachment, Exhibit,
Schedule or Addenda. In particular, if an Appendix contains a Term length that differs from the
Term length in the main body of this Agreement, the Term length of that Appendix will control the
length of time that services or activities are to occur under that Appendix, but will not affect the
Term length of the remainder of this Agreement.

2.8.1 If any provision of this Agreement is rejected or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, each
Party agrees that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to
effect the intent of the Parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary
to effect the intent of the Parties, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with enforceable language that reflects such

all attachments, appendices and/or schedules hereto) and every interconnection, service and
network element provided hereunder, are subject to all other Provisions contained in this
Agreement (including any and all attachments, appendices and/or schedules hereto), and all
such Provisions are integrally related.
2.10 Non-Voluntary Provisions

(individually and collectively, a “Non-Voluntary Arrangement”). SBC-13STATE has identified
some, but not all, of the Non-Voluntary Arrangements contained in this Agreement, by
designating such provisions with asterisks. If any Non-Voluntary Arrangement is modified as a
result of any order or finding by the FCC, the appropriate Commission or a court of competent
jurisdiction, any Party may, by providing written notice to the other Party, require that any
affected Non-Voluntary Arrangement (and any related rates, terms and conditions) be deleted or
renegotiated, as applicable, in good faith and this Agreement amended accordingly. If such
modifications to this Agreement are not executed within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of
such notice, a Party may pursue its rights under Section 10.
2.10.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Non-Voluntary Arrangements contained in this Agreement
shall not be available in any state other than the state that originally imposed/required such Non-
Voluntary Arrangement. By way of example only, the Parties acknowledge that the PUC-OH’s
imposition in Ohio of the Minimum Telephone Service Standards (and all terms and conditions
relating thereto) shall not apply in or be “portable to" any state other than Ohio.
2.11 State-Specific Rates, Terms and Conditions
2.11.1 For ease of administration, this multistate Agreement contains certain specified rates, terms and
conditions which apply only in a designated state (“state-specific terms”). To the extent that
this Agreement contains specified rates, terms and conditions which apply only in a given state,
such rates, terms and conditions shall not apply and shall have no effect in any other state(s) to
which this Agreement is submitted for approval under Section 252(e) of the Act.
2.11.2 State-specific terms, as the phrase is described in Section 2.11.1 above, have been negotiated
(or in the case of 2.10.2 above, included in the agreement per state requirement) by the Parties
only as to the states where this Agreement has been executed, filed and approved. When the
Parties negotiate an agreement for an additional state, neither Party shall be precluded by any
language in this Agreement from negotiating state-specific terms for the state in which are to
apply.
2.11.3 Successor Rates. Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in the applicable Appendix
Pricing have been established by the appropriate Commissions in cost proceedings or dockets
initiated under or pursuant to the Act. If during the Term that Commission or the FCC changes a
rate, price or charge in an order or docket that applies to any of the Interconnection, Resale
Services, Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services available hereunder, the
Parties agree to amend this Agreement to incorporate such new rates, prices and charges, with
such rates, prices and charges to be effective as of the date specified in such order or docket
(including giving effect to any retroactive application, if so ordered). If either Party refuses to
execute an amendment to this Agreement within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of such
order or docket, the other Party may pursue its rights under Section 10.

or control with CLEC. CLEC further agrees that the same or substantially the same terms and
conditions shall be incorporated into any separate agreement between SBC-13STATE and any
such CLEC Affiliate that continues to operate as a separate entity. This Agreement shall remain
effective as to CLEC and any such CLEC Affiliate for the term of this Agreement as stated herein
until either SBC-13STATE or CLEC or any such CLEC Affiliate institutes renegotiation consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement for renewal and term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement will not supercede a currently effective interconnection agreement between any such
CLEC Affiliate and SBC-13STATE until the expiration of such other agreement.

6.4.2 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of
fraud. CLEC understands and agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to

System alert.
6.4.3 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud
Monitoring System alert notification.
6.5 In SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE and SBC CALIFORNIA ABT-related alerts are provided to

however, that after three (3) months of operation, SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE may request assurance of payment of charges reasonably anticipated by SBC
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE to be incurred in Arkansas in an amount not to exceed
two times projected average monthly billing to CLEC.
7.3.3.2 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, SBC SOUTHWEST REGION

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
10.1 Finality of Disputes
10.1.1 Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, no claim may be brought for any
dispute arising from this Agreement more than twenty-four (24) months from the date the
occurrence which gives rise to the dispute is discovered or reasonably should have been
discovered with the exercise of due care and attention.
10.1.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party shall be entitled to
dispute only those charges which appeared on a bill dated within the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding the date on which the Billing Party received notice of such Disputed
Amounts.
10.2 Alternative to Litigation
10.2.1 The Parties desire to resolve disputes arising out of this Agreement without litigation.
Accordingly, the Parties agree to use the following Dispute Resolution procedures with respect to
any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach.
10.3 Commencing Dispute Resolution
10.3.1 Dispute Resolution shall commence upon one Party’s receipt of written notice of a controversy or
claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach. No Party may pursue any claim
unless such written notice has first been given to the other Party. There are three (3) separate
Dispute Resolution methods:
10.3.1.1 Service Center (SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), LSC (SBC-7STATE) or LEC-C
(SBC CONNECTICUT);
10.3.1.2 Informal Dispute Resolution; and
10.3.1.3 Formal Dispute Resolution, each of which is described below.
10.4 LSC/Service Center/LEC-C Dispute Resolution - the following Dispute Resolution procedures will apply
with respect to any billing dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement. Written notice sent to
SBC-13STATE for Disputed Amounts must be made on the “13 Billing Claims Dispute Form”.
10.4.1 If the written notice given pursuant to Section 10.3 discloses that a CLEC dispute relates to
billing, then the procedures set forth in this Section 10.4 shall be used and the dispute shall first
be referred to the appropriate service center SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE Service Center;
SBC-7STATE Local Service Center (LSC); SBC CONNECTICUT Local Exchange Carrier
Center (LEC-C)] for resolution. In order to resolve a billing dispute, CLEC shall furnish SBC-
13STATE written notice of (i) the date of the bill in question, (ii) CBA/ESBA/ASBS or BAN
number of the bill in question, (iii) telephone number, circuit ID number or trunk number in
question, (iv) any USOC information relating to the item questioned, (v) amount billed and (vi)
amount in question and (vii) the reason that CLEC disputes the billed amount. To be deemed a
“dispute” under this Section 10.4, CLEC must provide evidence that it has either paid the
disputed amount or established an interest bearing escrow account that complies with the
requirements set forth in Section 8.6 of this Agreement and deposited all Unpaid Charges

relating to Resale Services and Lawful Unbundled Network Elements into that escrow account.
Failure to provide the information and evidence required by this Section 10.4.1 not later than
twenty-nine (29) calendar days following the Bill Due Date shall constitute CLEC’s irrevocable
and full waiver of its right to dispute the subject charges.
10.4.2 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on SBC-13STATE’s current
billing statements thirty (30) to sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided the
CLEC furnishes all requisite information and evidence under Section 10.4.1 by the Bill Due
Date). If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days, upon request, SBC-13STATE will notify
CLEC of the status of the dispute and the expected resolution date.
10.4.3 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on statements prior to the
current billing statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days, but resolution may take
longer depending on the complexity of the dispute. If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date notice of the Disputed Amounts was received (provided that CLEC furnishes
all requisite information and evidence under Section 10.4.1), SBC-13STATE will notify CLEC of
the status of the dispute and the expected resolution date.
10.4.4 Any notice of Disputed Amounts given by SBC-13STATE to CLEC pursuant to Section 10.3 shall
furnish CLEC written notice of: (i) the date of the bill in question, (ii) the account number or other
identification of the bill in question, (iii) any telephone number, circuit ID number or trunk number
in question, (iv) any USOC (or other descriptive information) questioned, (v) the amount billed,
(vi) the amount in question, and (vii) the reason that SBC-13STATE disputes the billed amount.
The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on current billing statement(s)
thirty (30) to sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided SBC-13STATE, furnishes
all requisite information by the Bill Due Date) and Disputed Amounts appearing on statements
prior to the current billing statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days, but resolution
may take longer depending on the complexity of the dispute. If not resolved within thirty (30)
calendar days, CLEC will notify SBC-13STATE of the status of the dispute and the expected
resolution date.
10.4.5 If the Non-Paying Party is not satisfied by the resolution of the billing dispute under this Section
10.4, the Non-Paying Party may notify the Billing Party in writing that it wishes to invoke the
Informal Resolution of Disputes afforded pursuant to Section 10.5 of this Agreement.
10.5 Informal Resolution of Disputes
10.5.1 Upon receipt by one Party of notice of a dispute by the other Party pursuant to Section 10.3 or
Section 10.4.5, each Party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The location, form,
frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions will be left to the discretion of the
representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative Dispute
Resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and the
correspondence among the representatives for purposes of settlement are exempt from
discovery and production and will not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any
lawsuit without the concurrence of both Parties. Documents identified in or provided with such
communications that were not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted,
and, if otherwise admissible, may be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.
10.6 Formal Dispute Resolution
10.6.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the informal procedure described in
Section 10.5, then either Party may invoke the formal Dispute Resolution procedures described
in this Section 10.6. Unless agreed among all Parties, formal Dispute Resolution procedures,
including arbitration or other procedures as appropriate, may be invoked not earlier than sixty
(60) calendar days after receipt of the letter initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 10.3.

10.6.2 Claims Subject to Mandatory Arbitration. The following claims, if not settled through informal
Dispute Resolution, will be subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to Section 10.7 below:
10.6.2.1 Each unresolved billing dispute involving one percent (1%) or less of the amounts
charged to the Disputing Party under this Agreement in the state in which the dispute
arises during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding receipt of the letter
initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 10.3. If the disputing Party has not been
billed for a minimum of twelve (12) months immediately preceding receipt of the letter
initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 10.3, the Parties will annualize the actual
number of months billed.
10.6.3 Claims Subject to Elective Arbitration. Claims will be subject to elective arbitration pursuant to
Section 10.7 if, and only if, the claim is not settled through informal Dispute Resolution and both
Parties agree to arbitration. If both Parties do not agree to arbitration, then either Party may
proceed with any remedy available to it pursuant to law, equity or agency mechanism.
10.6.4 Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. If the following claims are not resolved through informal
Dispute Resolution, they will not be subject to arbitration and must be resolved through any
remedy available to a Party pursuant to law, equity or agency mechanism.
10.6.4.1 Actions seeking a temporary restraining order or an injunction related to the purposes of
this Agreement.
10.6.4.2 Actions to compel compliance with the Dispute Resolution process.
10.6.4.3 All claims arising under federal or state statute(s), including antitrust claims.
10.7 Arbitration
10.7.1 Disputes subject to mandatory or elective arbitration under the provisions of this Agreement will
be submitted to a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association or pursuant to such other provider of arbitration services or rules as the
Parties may agree. The arbitrator shall be knowledgeable of telecommunications issues. Each
arbitration will be held in Dallas, Texas (SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE); Chicago,
Illinois (SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), San Francisco, California (SBC CALIFORNIA);
Reno, Nevada (SBC NEVADA); or New Haven, Connecticut (SBC CONNECTICUT), as
appropriate, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitration hearing will be requested to
commence within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitrator will
control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The Parties may submit written
briefs upon a schedule determined by the arbitrator. The Parties will request that the arbitrator
rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of
hearings. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Secs. 1-16, not state law, shall govern the
arbitrability of all disputes. Notwithstanding any rule of the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules to
the contrary, the Parties agree that the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive
damages, exemplary damages, Consequential Damages, multiple damages, or any other
damages not measured by the prevailing Party's actual damages, and may not, in any event,
make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The times specified in this Section may be extended or shortened upon mutual
agreement of the Parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Each Party will bear
its own costs of these procedures, including attorneys' fees. The Parties will equally split the fees
of the arbitration and the arbitrator. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and service(s) that were
not performed or were improperly performed.
13.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in specific appendices, in the case of any Loss alleged or
claimed by a Third Party to have arisen out of the negligence or willful misconduct of any Party, each
Party shall bear, and its obligation shall be limited to, that portion (as mutually agreed to by the Parties
or as otherwise established) of the resulting expense caused by its own negligence or willful
misconduct or that of its agents, servants, contractors, or others acting in aid or concert with it.
13.3 A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and contracts with its End Users or Third Parties
that relate to any Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions,
facilities, products and services provided or contemplated under this Agreement that, to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Party shall not be liable to such End User or Third Party for (i)
any Loss relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds
the amount such Party would have charged the End User or Third Party for the Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services that gave
rise to such Loss and (ii) any Consequential Damages. If a Party elects not to place in its tariffs or
contracts such limitation(s) of liability, and the other Party incurs a Loss as a result thereof, the first
Party shall indemnify and reimburse the other Party for that portion of the Loss that would have been
limited had the first Party included in its tariffs and contracts the limitation(s) of liability described in this
Section 13.3.
13.4 Neither CLEC nor SBC-13STATE shall be liable to the other Party for any Consequential Damages
suffered by the other Party, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty, strict liability,
tort or otherwise, including negligence of any kind, whether active or passive (and including alleged
breaches of this Agreement and causes of action alleged to arise from allegations that breach of this
Agreement constitutes a violation of the Act or other statute), and regardless of whether the Parties
knew or had been advised of the possibility that such damages could result in connection with or arising
from anything said, omitted, or done hereunder or related hereto, including willful acts or omissions;
provided that the foregoing shall not limit a Party’s obligation under Section 14 to indemnify, defend,
and hold the other Party harmless against any amounts payable to a Third Party, including any Losses,
and Consequential Damages of such Third Party; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 13.4
shall impose indemnity obligations on a Party for any Loss or Consequential Damages suffered by that
Party’s End User in connection with any affected Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services. Except as provided in the prior sentence,
each Party (“Indemnifying Party”) hereby releases and holds harmless the other Party
(“Indemnitee”) (and Indemnitee’s Affiliates, and its respective officers, directors, employees and
agents) against any Loss or Claim made by the Indemnifying Party’s End User.
13.5 SBC-13STATE shall not be liable for damages to an End User’s premises resulting from the furnishing
of any Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities,
products or services, including, if applicable, the installation and removal of equipment and associated
wiring, unless the damage is caused by SBC-13STATE’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. SBC-

Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products or services when used in an

13.8 This Section 13 is not intended to exempt any Party from all liability under this Agreement, but only to
set forth the scope of liability agreed to and the type of damages that are recoverable. Both Parties
acknowledge that they negotiated regarding alternate limitation of liability provisions but that such
provisions would have altered the cost, and thus the price, of providing the Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services available
hereunder, and no different pricing reflecting different costs and different limits of liability was agreed to.
14. INDEMNITY

prohibited by Applicable Law and not otherwise controlled by tariff, each Party (the “Indemnifying

Indemnified Party harmless against any Loss to a Third Party arising out of the negligence or willful
misconduct (“Fault”) of such Indemnifying Party, its agents, its End Users, contractors, or others
retained by such Parties, in connection with the Indemnifying Party’s provision of Interconnection,
Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services
under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) with respect to employees or agents of the
Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their employment, (ii) with
respect to subcontractors of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing
duties of the subcontractor under its subcontract with the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) with respect to the

alleged or claimed such Loss (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend and indemnify the other Party
(the “Indemnified Party”) against any and all such Claims or Losses by its End User regardless of
whether the underlying Interconnection, Resale Service, Lawful Unbundled Network Element, function,
facility, product or service giving rise to such Claim or Loss was provided or provisioned by the
Indemnified Party, unless the Claim or Loss was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Indemnified Party.
14.4 A Party (the "Indemnifying Party") shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party
(“Indemnified Party”) against any Claim or Loss arising from the Indemnifying Party’s use of

specific information associated with either the originating or terminating numbers used
to provision Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements,
functions, facilities, products or services provided hereunder and all other Claims arising
out of any act or omission of the End User in the course of using any Interconnection,

Loss arises from an Indemnifying Party’s or an Indemnifying Party’s End User’s use of
Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions,
facilities, products or services provided under this Agreement; provided, however, that
an Indemnifying Party’s obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party shall
not apply:
14.4.1.2.1 where an Indemnified Party or its End User modifies Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products
or services; provided under this Agreement; and

14.4.2 Any and all penalties imposed on either Party because of the Indemnifying Party’s failure to
comply with the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA);
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall also, at its sole cost and expense, pay any amounts
necessary to modify or replace any equipment, facilities or services provided to the Indemnified

(including without limitation, patent, copyright, trade secret, trade mark, service mark, trade name and
trade dress rights) and contract rights of Third Parties.
14.5.1 The Parties acknowledge that on April 27, 2000, the FCC released its Memorandum Opinion and
Order in CC Docket No. 96-98 (File No. CCBPol. 97-4), In the Matter of Petition of MCI for

reasonable terms, Intellectual Property rights to each Lawful UNE necessary for CLEC
to use such Lawful UNE in the same manner as SBC-13STATE.
14.5.1.2 SBC-13STATE shall have no obligation to attempt to obtain for CLEC any Intellectual

Elements (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) in SBC-13STATE’s network or
CLEC's use of other functions, facilities, products or services furnished under this Agreement.
Any licenses or warranties for Intellectual Property rights associated with Lawful UNEs are
vendor licenses and warranties and are a part of the Intellectual Property rights SBC-13STATE
agrees in Section 14.5.1.1 to use its best efforts to obtain.
14.5.3 SBC-13STATE does not and shall not indemnify, defend or hold CLEC harmless, nor be
responsible for indemnifying or defending, or holding CLEC harmless, for any Claims or Losses
for actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property right or interference with or violation

SBC-13STATE’s network and unbundling and/or combining SBC-13STATE’s Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) or CLEC's use of other

or subcontractors or CLEC's End User or resulting from CLEC’s improper use of SBC-13STATE's
facilities, or due to malfunction of any facilities, functions, products, services or equipment provided by
any person or entity other than SBC-13STATE. Upon reimbursement for damages, SBC-13STATE will
cooperate with CLEC in prosecuting a claim against the person causing such damage. CLEC shall be
subrogated to the right of recovery by SBC-13STATE for the damages to the extent of such payment.
14.7 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each Party agrees that should it cause any non-
standard digital subscriber line (“xDSL”) technologies (as that term is defined in the applicable Appendix
DSL and/or the applicable commission-ordered tariff, as appropriate) to be deployed or used in
connection with or on SBC-13STATE facilities, that Party (“Indemnifying Party”) will pay all costs
associated with any damage, service interruption or other Telecommunications Service degradation, or
damage to the other Party’s (“Indemnitee’s”) facilities.
14.8 Indemnification Procedures
14.8.1 Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this Section 14, the relevant Indemnified
Party, as appropriate, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and request in writing the
Indemnifying Party to defend the same. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party might have, except to
the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such claim.
14.8.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion, in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of
the defense of such claim and the identity of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party.
14.8.3 Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides written notice of acceptance of the defense of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, subject to any right of the Indemnifying Party to seek reimbursement for the costs of such
defense in the event that it is determined that Indemnifying Party had no obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party for such claim.
14.8.4 Upon accepting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control and
conduct the defense and settlement of any such claims, subject to consultation with the
Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is controlling and conducting the defense,
Page 48 of 943

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS/SBC-13STATE
PAGE 45 OF 61
Page 49 of 861 SBC-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-(AR IN KS MO NV OK TX), LLC.
032405
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such
Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in advance and agrees to be bound by the
agreement incorporating such settlement.
14.8.5 At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise or settlement, and,
at such refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that, in such event the
Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the refusing
Party against, any cost or liability in excess of such refused compromise or settlement.
14.8.6 With respect to any defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will be
entitled to participate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the claim requests equitable
relief or other relief that could affect the rights of the Indemnified Party, and shall also be entitled
to employ separate counsel for such defense at such Indemnified Party's expense.
14.8.7 If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any indemnified claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel for such defense at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party.
14.8.8 In the event of a failure to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may negotiate a
settlement, which shall be presented to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party refuses
to agree to the presented settlement, the Indemnifying Party may take over the defense. If the
Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented settlement and refuses to take over the
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any reasonable cash settlement not involving
any admission of liability by the Indemnifying Party, though such settlement may have been
made by the Indemnified Party without approval of the Indemnifying Party, it being the Parties'
intent that no settlement involving a non-monetary concession by the Indemnifying Party,
including an admission of liability by such Party, shall take effect without the written approval of
the Indemnifying Party.
14.8.9 Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause its employees and agents to cooperate with the
other Party in the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each Party shall be
available to the other Party with respect to any such defense, subject to the restrictions and
limitations set forth in Section 20.

authorization prior to changing an End User’s Local Exchange Carrier to itself and in assuming
responsibility for any applicable charges as specified in the FCC’s rules regarding Subscriber
Carrier Selection Changes (47 CFR 64.1100 through 64.1170) and any applicable state

documentation of authorization relating to its End User’s selection of such Party as its LEC,
which documentation shall be available for inspection by the other Party at its request during
normal business hours and at no charge.
24.1.2 Only an End User can initiate a challenge to a change in its LEC. If an End User notifies one
Party that the End User requests local exchange service, and the other Party is such End User’s
LEC, then the Party receiving such request shall be free to immediately access such End User’s
CPNI subject to the requirements of the applicable Appendix OSS restricting access to CPNI in

for use by another End User and is free to issue service orders required to reclaim such facilities.
24.1.4 Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to investigate any allegations of unauthorized

further documents requirements for Local Exchange Carrier changes and required End User
authorizations.

provider of local exchange service and the network facilities are provided by the same network
provider.

pen register, trap-and-trace or form of intercept on the Party's facilities, in which case
that Party shall comply with any valid request.

for all federal, state, or local sales, use, excise, gross receipts, municipal fees, transfer, transaction or

Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products
and services under this Agreement provided by or to such Party, except for (a) any Tax on either party’s

report its access lines to the Texas Public Utility Commission, will remit the related payments to
municipalities, and will otherwise comply with Chapter 283 and applicable P.U.C rules, as they may be
amended from time to time.
33.3 With respect to any purchase of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network
Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement if any Tax is required or
permitted by Applicable Law to be collected from the purchasing Party by the providing Party, then: (i)
the providing Party shall bill the purchasing Party for such Tax; (ii) the purchasing Party shall remit such
Tax to the providing Party; and (iii) the providing Party shall remit such collected Tax to the applicable
taxing authority. Failure to include Taxes on an invoice or to state a Tax separately shall not impair the
obligation of the purchasing Party to pay any Tax. Nothing shall prevent the providing Party from paying
any Tax to the appropriate taxing authority prior to the time: (i) it bills the purchasing Party for such Tax,
or (ii) it collects the Tax from the purchasing Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the purchasing Party shall be liable for and the providing Party may collect Taxes which were
assessed by or paid to an appropriate taxing authority within the statute of limitations period but not
included on an invoice within four (4) years after the Tax otherwise was owed or due.
33.4 With respect to any purchase hereunder of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement that are resold to a
third party, if any Tax is imposed by Applicable Law on the End User in connection with any such
purchase, then: (i) the purchasing Party shall be required to impose and/or collect such Tax from the
End User; and (ii) the purchasing Party shall remit such Tax to the applicable taxing authority. The
purchasing Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the providing Party for any costs incurred by
the providing Party as a result of actions taken by the applicable taxing authority to collect the Tax from

authority.
33.5 If the providing Party fails to bill or to collect any Tax as required herein, then, as between the providing
Party and the purchasing Party: (i) the purchasing Party shall remain liable for such uncollected Tax;
and (ii) the providing Party shall be liable for any penalty and interest assessed with respect to such
Page 57 of 943

uncollected Tax by such authority. However, if the purchasing Party fails to pay any Taxes properly
billed, then, as between the providing Party and the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party will be
solely responsible for payment of the Taxes, penalty and interest.
33.6 If the purchasing Party fails to impose and/or collect any Tax from End Users as required herein, then,
as between the providing Party and the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall remain liable for
such uncollected Tax and any interest and penalty assessed thereon with respect to the uncollected
Tax by the applicable taxing authority. With respect to any Tax that the purchasing Party has agreed to
pay or impose on and/or collect from End Users, the purchasing Party agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the providing Party for any costs incurred by the providing Party as a result of actions taken
by the applicable taxing authority to collect the Tax from the providing Party due to the failure of the
purchasing Party to pay or collect and remit such Tax to such authority.
33.7 If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other Governmental Authority, the other Party agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to any audit inquiries in a proper
and timely manner so that the audit and/or any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.
33.8 To the extent a sale is claimed to be for resale and thus subject to tax exemption, the purchasing Party
shall furnish the providing Party a proper resale tax exemption certificate as authorized or required by
statute or regulation of the jurisdiction providing said resale tax exemption. Failure to timely provide said
resale tax exemption certificate will result in no exemption being available to the purchasing Party for
any period prior to the date that the purchasing Party presents a valid certificate. If Applicable Law
excludes or exempts a purchase of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network
Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement from a Tax, but does not
also provide an exemption procedure, then the providing Party will not collect such Tax if the
purchasing Party (a) furnishes the providing Party with a letter signed by an officer of the purchasing
Party claiming an exemption and identifying the Applicable Law that both allows such exemption and
does not require an exemption certificate; and (b) supplies the providing Party with an indemnification
agreement, reasonably acceptable to the providing Party, which holds the providing Party harmless
from any tax, interest, penalties, loss, cost or expense with respect to forbearing to collect such Tax.
33.9 With respect to any Tax or Tax controversy covered by this Section 33, the purchasing Party is entitled
to contest with the imposing jurisdiction, pursuant to Applicable Law and at its own expense, any Tax
that it is ultimately obligated to pay or collect. The purchasing Party will ensure that no lien is attached
to any asset of the providing Party as a result of any contest. The purchasing Party shall be entitled to
the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts that it had previously paid resulting from such a
contest. Amounts previously paid by the providing Party shall be refunded to the providing Party. The
providing Party will cooperate in any such contest.
33.10 All notices, affidavits, exemption certificates or other communications required or permitted to be given
by either Party to the other under this Section 34 shall be sent in accordance with Section 17 hereof.
34. NON-WAIVER
34.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
consent to any default under this Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and
properly executed by or on behalf of the Party against whom such waiver or consent is claimed. Waiver
by either Party of any default by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default.
Failure of either Party to insist on performance of any term or condition of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or future waiver of such term,
condition, right or privilege. No course of dealing or failure of any Party to strictly enforce any term,
right, or condition of this Agreement in any instance shall be construed as a general waiver or
relinquishment of such term, right or condition.

other Party’s End Users. Facsimile (FAX) numbers must be exchanged by the Parties to facilitate event
notifications for planned mass calling events.
35.6 Neither Party shall use any Interconnection, Resale Service, Lawful Unbundled Network Element,
function, facility, product or service provided under this Agreement or any other service related thereto

any carrier from using its Telecommunications Service, impairs the quality or the privacy of
Telecommunications Service to other carriers or to either Party’s End Users, causes hazards to either
Party’s personnel or the public, damage to either Party’s or any connecting carrier's facilities or
equipment, including any malfunction of ordering or billing systems or equipment. Upon such

violation at the earliest practicable time.

receive inquiries regarding the other Party’s services:

IntraLATA Toll traffic originating from an End User obtaining local dialtone from SBC-13STATE where SBC-
13STATE is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and IntraLATA Toll provider.
3. ONE-WAY AND TWO-WAY TRUNK GROUPS
3.1 CLEC shall issue Access Service Requests (ASRs) for two-way Local Only Trunk Groups, Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups and Meet Point Trunk Groups. CLEC shall issue ASRs for one-way trunk
groups originating at CLEC’s switch. SBC-13STATE shall issue ASRs for one-way trunk groups originating
at the SBC-13STATE switch.
3.2 Trunk groups for ancillary services (e.g. OS/DA, BLVI, High Volume Call In, and E911) and Meet Point
Trunk Groups can be established between CLEC’s switch and the appropriate SBC-13STATE Tandem
Switch as further provided in this Appendix ITR.
3.3 Two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Groups can be established between CLEC’s switch and an SBC-
12STATE Local Tandem or End Office Switch. Two-way Local Only Trunk Groups can be established
between CLEC’s switch and an SBC-12STATE Local Tandem. These trunk groups will utilize Signaling
System 7 (SS7) or multi-frequency (MF) signaling protocol, with SS7 signaling preferred whenever possible.
3.4 Local Interconnection Trunk Groups in SBC CONNECTICUT must be ordered and provisioned as one-way
to accommodate billing and technical limitations.

011205
implementation schedule. SBC-12STATE agrees to develop a cutover plan and project manage the
cutovers with CLEC participation and agreement.
4. TANDEM TRUNKING AND DIRECT END OFFICE TRUNKING
4.1 SBC-13STATE deploys in its network Local Only Tandem Switches (SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE and SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), Local/IntraLATATandem Switches (SBC SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE) Local/Access Tandem Switches and Access Tandem Switches. In addition SBC-
13STATE deploys Tandems that switch ancillary traffic such as E911 (E911 Tandem or E911 Selective
Routing Tandem), Operator Services/ Directory Assistance (OS/DA Tandem), and Mass Calling (choke
Tandem).
4.2 CLEC shall establish Local Only or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to all Local Tandems in the LATA
in which CLEC Offers Service in SBC CONNECTICUT, SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, and SBC-
2STATE. If CLEC Offers Service in a LATA in which there is no SBC Local Tandem, CLEC shall establish
Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to each SBC-13STATE End Office Switch in that LATA in which it
Offers Service. CLEC shall establish Local Only or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to all Local
Tandems in the local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service in SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE. If there are no Local Tandems in the local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service in the
SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, CLEC shall establish a Local Interconnection Trunk Group to each
SBC-13STATE End Office Switch in that local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service. CLEC shall
route appropriate traffic (i.e. only traffic to End Offices that subtend that Local Tandem) to the respective
SBC-13STATE Local Tandem on the trunk groups defined below. SBC-13STATE shall route appropriate
traffic to CLEC switches on the trunk groups defined below.
4.3 Direct End Office Trunk Group(s) (DEOTs) transport Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic between
CLEC’s switch and an SBC-13STATE End Office and are not switched at a Local Tandem location. CLEC
shall establish a two-way Direct End Office Trunk Group (one-way in SBC-CONNECTICUT) when actual or
projected End Office Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks.
Once provisioned, traffic from CLEC to SBC-13STATE must be redirected to route first to the DEOT with
overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate SBC-13STATE Local Tandem. If an SBC-13STATE End
Office does not subtend an SBC-13STATE Local Tandem, a direct final Direct End Office Trunk Group will
be established by CLEC, and there will be no overflow of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.4 All traffic received by SBC-13STATE on the DEOT from CLEC must terminate in the End Office, i.e. no
Tandem switching will be performed in the End Office. Where End Office functionality is provided in a
Remote End Office Switch of a host/remote configuration, CLEC shall establish the DEOT at the host
switch. The number of digits to be received by the SBC-13STATE End Office shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties. This trunk group shall be two-way (one-way in SBC CONNECTICUT).
4.5 Trunk Configuration
4.5.1 Trunk Configuration – SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE
and SBC CONNECTICUT
4.5.1.1 Where available and upon the request of the other Party, each Party shall cooperate to
ensure that its trunk groups are configured utilizing the Bipolar 8 Zero Substitution Extended
Super Frame (B8ZS ESF) protocol for 64 kbps Clear Channel Capability (64CCC)
transmission to allow for ISDN interoperability between the Parties’ respective networks.
Trunk groups configured for 64CCC and carrying Circuit Switched Data (CSD) ISDN calls
shall carry the appropriate Trunk Type Modifier in the CLCI-Message code. Trunk groups
configured for 64CCC and not used to carry CSD ISDN calls shall carry a different
appropriate Trunk Type Modifier in the CLCI-Message code.
4.5.1.2 Any SBC-13STATE switch incapable of handling 64CCC traffic will require that Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups be established at those switches using Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI).

4.5.2 Trunk Configuration – SBC-2STATE
4.5.2.1 When Interconnecting at SBC-2STATE’s digital End Offices, the Parties have a preference
for use of Bipolar 8 Zero Substitution Extended Super Frame (B8ZS ESF) two-way trunks
for all traffic between their networks. Where available, such trunk equipment will be used
for Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. Where AMI trunks are used, either Party may
request upgrade to B8ZS ESF when such equipment is available.
4.5.2.2 When interconnecting at SBC CALIFORNIA’s DMS Access Tandem(s), 64CCC data and
voice traffic may be combined on the same two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group.
64 CCC data and voice traffic must be on separate two-way Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups and not combined at SBC CALIFORNIA’s 4E Access Tandems.
5. TRUNK GROUPS
5.1 When CLEC Offers Service in a Local Exchange Area or LATA, the following trunk groups shall be used to
exchange various types of traffic between CLEC End Users and SBC-13STATE End Users.
5.2 Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each Local Exchange Area: SBC SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE.
5.2.1 A two-way Local Only Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and each SBC
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch in the local exchange area. Inter-
Tandem switching is not provided.
5.2.2 A two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC switch and each
SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switch and each Local/Access
Tandem Switch in the local exchange area. Inter-Tandem switching is not provided.
5.2.3 SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE reserves the right to initiate a one-way IntraLATA Trunk
Group to CLEC in order to provide Tandem relief when a community of interest is outside the local
exchange area in which CLEC is interconnected.
5.2.4 Where traffic from CLEC switch to an SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office is sufficient
(24 or more trunks), a Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall also be established to the SBC
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office.
5.2.5 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC switch to each SBC
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office in a local exchange area that has no Local Tandem.
This trunk group shall be established as a direct final.
5.2.6 When SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has a separate Local Only Tandem Switch(es) in the
local exchange area, and a separate Access Tandem Switch that serves the same local exchange
area, a two-way IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group shall be established to the SBC SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE Access Tandem Switch. In addition a two-way Local Only Trunk Group(s) shall
be established from CLEC’s switch to each SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only
Tandem Switch.
5.2.7 Each Party shall deliver to the other Party over the Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk
Group(s) only such traffic that originates and terminates in the same local exchange area.
5.3 Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in Each LATA: SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE,
SBC CONNECTICUT, SBC-2STATE
5.3.1 Tandem Trunking – SBC-2STATE and SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE
5.3.1.1 In SBC-2STATE and SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE;
5.3.1.1.1 Section 251(b)(5) and ISP Bound Traffic shall be routed on Local Only Trunk
Groups established at all SBC Local Only Tandems in the LATA for calls
destined to or from all SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE End Offices that
Page 213 of 943

011205
subtend the designated tandem. These trunk groups shall be two-way and will
utilize Signaling System (SS7) signaling.
5.3.1.1.2 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups established at all SBC Local/IntraLATA,
Local/Access, or Access Tandem Switch(es) (SBC-2STATE only) in the LATA
for calls destined to or from all SBC-2STATE and SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE End Offices that subtend the designated tandems. These trunk groups
shall be two-way and will utilize Signaling System (SS7) signaling.
5.3.2 Tandem Trunking – SBC CONNECTICUT
5.3.2.1 In SBC CONNECTICUT, Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups established at all SBC Local Tandems in the LATA for calls
destined to or from all SBC CONNECTICUT End Offices that subtend the designated
tandem. These trunk groups shall be one-way and will utilize Signaling System 7 (SS7)
signaling.
5.3.3 Direct End Office Trunking
5.3.3.1 The Parties shall establish Direct End Office Trunk Groups for the exchange of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic where actual or projected traffic demand is or will be
twenty-four (24) or more trunks.
5.4 Meet Point Trunk Group: SBC-13STATE
5.4.1 IXC carried traffic shall be transported between CLEC’s switch and the SBC-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch over a Meet Point Trunk Group separate from
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The Meet Point Trunk Group will be established for the
transmission and routing of exchange access traffic between CLEC’s End Users and IXCs via a
SBC-13STATE Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
5.4.2 Meet Point Trunk Groups shall be provisioned as two-way and will utilize SS7 signaling, except
multifrequency (“MF”) signaling will be used on a separate Meet Point Trunk Group to complete
originating calls to switched access customers that use MF FGD signaling protocol.
5.4.3 When SBC-13STATE has more than one Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch in a local
exchange area or LATA, CLEC shall establish a Meet Point Trunk Group to every SBC-13STATE
Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch where CLEC has homed its NXX code(s).
5.4.4 SBC-13STATE will not block switched access customer traffic delivered to any SBC-13STATE
Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch for completion on CLEC’s network. The
Parties understand and agree that Meet Point trunking arrangements are available and functional
only to/from switched access customers who directly connect with any SBC-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch that CLEC’s switch subtends in each LATA. In no
event will SBC-13STATE be required to route such traffic through more than one of its tandem
switches for connection to/from switched access customers. SBC-13STATE shall have no
responsibility to ensure that any switched access customer will accept traffic that CLEC directs to the
switched access customer.
5.4.5 CLEC shall provide all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, charge number and
originating line information ("OLI"). For terminating FGD, SBC-13STATE will pass all SS7 signaling
information including, without limitation, CPN if it receives CPN from FGD carriers. All privacy
indicators will be honored. Where available, network signaling information such as transit network
selection ("TNS") parameter, carrier identification codes (“CIC”) (CCS platform) and CIC/OZZ
information (non-SS7 environment) will be provided by CLEC wherever such information is needed
for call routing or billing. The Parties will follow all OBF adopted standards pertaining to TNS and
CIC/OZZ codes.

011205
5.5 800/(8YY) Traffic: SBC-13STATE
5.5.1 If CLEC chooses SBC-13STATE to handle 800/(8YY) database queries from its switches, all CLEC
originating 800/(8YY) traffic will be routed over the Meet Point Trunk Group. This traffic will include a
combination of both Interexchange Carrier (IXC) 800/(8YY) service and CLEC 800/(8YY) service
that will be identified and segregated by carrier through the database query handled through the
SBC-13STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
5.5.2 All originating Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC requests that SBC-13STATE
perform the Service Switching Point (“SSP”) function (e.g. perform the database query) shall be
delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk Group. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit
Code (to be determined for each LATA) shall be used for all such calls.
5.5.3 CLEC may handle its own 800/(8YY) database queries from its switch. If so, CLEC will determine
the nature (local/intraLATA/interLATA) of the 800/(8YY) call based on the response from the
database. If the query determines that the call is a local or IntraLATA 800/(8YY) number, CLEC will
route the post-query local or IntraLATA converted ten-digit local number to SBC-13STATE over the
Local Interconnection Trunk Group. In such case, CLEC is to provide an 800/(8YY) billing record
when appropriate. If the query reveals the call is an InterLATA 800/(8YY) number, CLEC will route
the post-query inter-LATA call (800/(8YY) number) directly from its switch for carriers interconnected
with its network or over the Meet Point Trunk Group to carriers not directly connected to its network
but are connected to SBC-13STATE’s Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch. Calls will be routed
to SBC-13STATE over the Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups or Meet Point
Trunk Groups within the LATA in which the calls originate.
5.5.4 All post-query Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC performs the SSP function, if
delivered to SBC-13STATE, shall be delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk
Group for calls destined to IXCs, or shall be delivered by CLEC using GR-317 format over the Local
Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group for calls destined to End Offices that directly subtend
the tandem.
5.6 E911 Trunk Group
5.6.1 A dedicated trunk group for each NPA shall be established to each appropriate E911 switch within
the local exchange area or LATA in which CLEC Offers Service. This trunk group shall be
provisioned as one-way outgoing only and will utilize MF CAMA signaling or, where available, SS7
signaling. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this trunk group.
Where the parties utilize SS7 signaling and the E911 network has the technology available, only
one E911 trunk group shall be established to handle multiple NPAs within the local exchange area or
LATA. If the E911 network does not have the appropriate technology available, a SS7 trunk group
shall be established for each NPA in the local exchange area or LATA. CLEC shall provide a
minimum of two (2) one-way outgoing channels on E911 trunk groups per default PSAP or default
ESN assignment dedicated for originating E911 emergency service calls from the Point of
Interconnection (POI) to the SBC-13STATE E911 Selective Router switch that serves a specified
geographic rate area.
5.6.2 In SBC CONNECTICUT only, CLEC will comply with the CT DPUC directives regarding the E911
trunk groups. The current directive requires CLEC to establish three separate dedicated trunk
groups for each Connecticut NPA and default PSAP or default ESN assignment, from its switch to
each of the Connecticut E911 Selective Routing tandems. For each NPA, one trunk group using
SS7 signaling will go to the Primary E911 Selective Routing tandem. A second trunk group using
SS7 will go to the Secondary E911 Selective routing tandem. The third trunk group will have MF
CAMA signaling and will go to the Primary E911 Selective Routing tandem and serve as a backup.
These trunk groups shall be provisioned by CLEC as one-way outgoing only. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs.

5.6.3 CLEC will cooperate with SBC-13STATE to promptly test all E911 trunks and facilities between
CLEC’s network and the SBC-13STATE E911 Selective Routing Tandem to assure proper
functioning of E911 service. CLEC will not turn up live traffic until successful testing is completed by
both Parties.
5.7 High Volume Call In (HVCI) / Mass Calling (Choke) Trunk Group: SBC-12STATE
5.7.1 A dedicated trunk group shall be required to the designated Public Response HVCI/Mass Calling
Network Access Tandem in each serving area. This trunk group shall be one-way outgoing only and
shall utilize MF signaling. As the HVCI/Mass Calling trunk group is designed to block all excessive
attempts toward HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs, it is necessarily exempt from the one percent blocking
standard described elsewhere for other final Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group. The Parties will
not exchange live traffic until successful testing is completed by both Parties.
5.7.2 This group shall be sized as follows:
Number of Access Lines Number of Mass Calling
Served Trunks
0 – 10,000 2
10,001 – 20,000 3
20,001 – 30,000 4
30,001 – 40,000 5
40,001 – 50,000 6
50,001 – 60,000 7
60,001 – 75,000 8
75,000 + 9 maximum
5.7.3 If CLEC should acquire a HVCI/Mass Calling customer, i.e. a radio station, CLEC shall notify SBC-
12STATE at least 60 days in advance of the need to establish a one-way outgoing SS7 or MF trunk
group from the SBC-12STATE HVCI/Mass Calling Serving Office to the CLEC customer’s serving
office. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
5.7.4 If CLEC finds it necessary to issue a new choke telephone number to a new or existing HVCI/Mass
Calling customer, CLEC may request a meeting to coordinate with SBC-12STATE the assignment of
HVCI/Mass Calling telephone number from the existing choke NXX. In the event that the CLEC
establishes a new choke NXX, CLEC must notify SBC-12STATE a minimum of ninety (90) days
prior to deployment of the new HVCI/Mass Calling NXX. SBC-12STATE will perform the necessary
translations in its End Offices and Tandem(s) and issue ASRs to establish a one-way outgoing SS7
or MF trunk group from the SBC-12STATE Public Response HVCI/Mass Calling Network Access
Tandem to CLEC’s choke serving office.
5.7.5 In SBC CONNECTICUT, where HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs have not been established, the Parties
agree to utilize “call gapping” as the method to control high volumes of calls, where technically
feasible in the originating switch, to specific high volume customers or in situations such as those
described in Section 35 Network Maintenance and Management of the General Terms and
Conditions.
5.8 Operator Services/Directory Assistance Trunk Group(s)
5.8.1 Terms and Conditions for Inward Assistance Operator Services are found in Appendix INW.
5.8.2 If SBC-13STATE agrees through a separate appendix or contract to provide Directory Assistance
and/or Operator Services for CLEC the following trunk groups are required:

011205
5.8.2.1 Directory Assistance (DA)
5.8.2.1.1 CLEC may contract for DA services only. A segregated trunk group for these
services will be required to the appropriate SBC-13STATE Operator Services
Tandem in the LATA for the NPA the CLEC wishes to serve. This trunk group
is provisioned as one-way outgoing only and utilizes Modified Operator
Services Signaling (2 Digit Automatic Number Identification (ANI)). CLEC will
have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way
trunk group.
5.8.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC)
5.8.2.2.1 CLEC contracting for DA services may also contract for DACC. This requires a
segregated one-way trunk group to each SBC-13STATE Operator Services
Tandem within the LATA for the combined DA and DACC traffic. This trunk
group is provisioned as one-way outgoing only and utilizes Modified Operator
Services Signaling (2 Digit ANI). CLEC will have administrative control for the
purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
5.8.2.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI)
5.8.2.3.1 When SBC-13STATE’s operator is under contract to verify the busy status of
CLEC End Users, SBC-13STATE will utilize a segregated one-way with MF
signaling trunk group from SBC-13STATE’s Operator Services Tandem to
CLEC switch. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing
ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
5.8.2.4 Operator Assistance (0+, 0-)
5.8.2.4.1 This service requires a one-way trunk group from CLEC switch to SBC-
13STATE’s Operator Services Tandem. Two types of trunk groups may be
utilized. If the trunk group transports DA/DACC, the trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate traffic use code and modifier. If DA is not
required or is transported on a segregated trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different appropriate traffic use code and modifier. Modified
Operator Services Signaling (2 Digit ANI) will be required on the trunk group.
CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this
one-way trunk group.
5.8.2.5 Digit-Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling
5.8.2.5.1 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS)
from the equal access End Offices (EAEO) to the Operator Services switch that
are equipped to accept 10 Digit Signaling for Automatic Number Identification
(ANI).
5.8.2.6 OS QUESTIONAIRE
5.8.2.6.1 If CLEC chooses SBC-13STATE to provide either OS and/or DA, then CLEC
agrees to accurately complete the OS Questionnaire prior to submitting ASRs
for OS and DA trunks.
6. TRUNK FORECASTING RESPONSIBILITIES: SBC-13STATE
6.1 CLEC agrees to provide an initial forecast for all trunk groups described in this Appendix ITR. SBC-
13STATE shall review this trunk forecast and provide any additional information that may impact the trunk
forecast information provided by CLEC. Subsequent trunk forecasts shall be provided on a semi-annual
basis, not later than January 1 and July 1 in order to be considered in the semi-annual publication of the
SBC-13STATE General Trunk Forecast. Parties agree to the use of Common Language Location
Identification (CLLI) coding and Common Language Circuit Identification for Message Trunk coding (CLCI-

100 respectively. Inquiries pertaining to use of TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Common Language
Standards and document availability should be directed to TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-
2673.
6.2 The semi-annual forecasts shall include:
6.2.1 Yearly forecasted trunk quantities for all trunk groups required in this Appendix for a minimum of
three (current plus 2 future) years; and
6.2.2 A description of major network projects anticipated for the following six months. Major network
projects include trunking or network rearrangements, shifts in anticipated traffic patterns, orders
greater than four (4) DS1s, or other activities that are reflected by a significant increase or decrease
in trunking demand for the following forecasting period.
6.2.3 The Parties shall agree on these forecasts to ensure efficient trunk utilization. For forecast
quantities that are in dispute, the Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to develop a mutually
agreeable forecast.
6.2.4 Orders for trunks that exceed forecasted quantities for forecasted locations will be accommodated
as mutually agreed to by the Parties. Parties shall make all reasonable efforts and cooperate in
good faith to develop alternative solutions to accommodate these orders.
6.3 CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting two-way trunk groups. SBC-13STATE shall be responsible for
forecasting the one-way trunk groups terminating to CLEC and CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting
the one-way trunk groups terminating to SBC-13STATE, unless otherwise specified in this Appendix.
6.4 Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact for planning and forecasting purposes.
7. TRUNK DESIGN BLOCKING CRITERIA: SBC-13STATE
7.1 Trunk requirements for forecasting and servicing shall be based on the blocking objectives shown in Table
1. Trunk requirements shall be based upon time consistent average busy season busy hour twenty (20)
day averaged loads applied to industry standard Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity algorithms (using
Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness factor until actual traffic data is available).
TABLE 1
Trunk Group Type Design Blocking Objective
Local Interconnection Trunk Group - Direct End Office (Primary High) ECCS*
Local Interconnection Trunk Group - Direct End Office (Final) 2%
IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 1%
Local Interconnection Trunk Group (Local Tandem) 1%
Meet Point (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 0.5%
E911 1%

8.2 Both Parties will jointly manage the capacity of Local Only, Local Interconnection, and Meet Point Trunk
Groups. Both Parties may send a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to the other Party to trigger
changes to the Local Only, Local Interconnection, and Meet Point Trunk Groups based on capacity
assessment. The TGSR is a standard industry support interface developed by the Ordering and Billing
Forum of the Carrier liaison Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions (ATIS)
organization. TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Special Report STS000316 describes the format and use of
the TGSR. Contact TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-2673 regarding the documentation
availability and use of this form.
8.3 Utilization: Utilization shall be defined as Trunks Required as a percentage of Trunks In Service.
8.3.1 In A Blocking Situation (Over-utilization)
8.3.1.1 In a blocking situation, CLEC is responsible for issuing ASRs on all two-way Local Only,
Local Interconnection and Meet Point Trunk Groups and one-way CLEC originating Local
Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured blocking to design
objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an ASR is not issued,
SBC-13STATE will issue a TSGR. CLEC will issue an ASR within three (3) business days
after receipt and review of the TGSR. CLEC will note "Service Affecting" on the ASR.
8.3.1.2 In a blocking situation, SBC-13STATE is responsible for issuing ASRs on one-way SBC
originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured
blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an
ASR is not issued, CLEC will issue a TSGR. SBC 13-STATE will issue an ASR within
three (3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR.
8.3.1.3 If an alternate final Local Only Trunk Group or Local Interconnection Trunk Group is at
seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR is sent to CLEC for the final and all
subtending high usages that are contributing any amount of overflow to the alternate final
route.
8.3.1.4 If a direct final Meet Point Trunk Group is at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR
shall be sent to CLEC.
8.3.2 Underutilization
8.3.2.1 Underutilization of Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups and Meet
Point Trunk Groups exists when provisioned capacity is greater than the current need.
Those situations where more capacity exists than actual usage requires will be handled in
the following manner:
8.3.2.1.1 If a Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk Group or a Meet
Point Trunk Group is under seventy-five percent (75%) of CCS capacity on a
monthly average basis, for each month of any three (3) consecutive months
period, either Party may request the issuance of an order to resize the Local
Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk Group or the Meet Point Trunk
Group, which shall be left with not less than twenty-five percent (25%) excess
capacity. In all cases, grade of service objectives shall be maintained.
8.3.2.1.2 Either party may send a TGSR to the other Party to trigger changes to the
Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups or Meet Point
Trunk Groups based on capacity assessment. Upon receipt of a TGSR, the
receiving Party will issue an ASR to the other Party within twenty (20) business
days after receipt of the TGSR.
8.3.2.1.3 Upon review of the TGSR, if a Party does not agree with the resizing, the
Parties will schedule a joint planning discussion within the twenty (20) business
Page 219 of 943

APPENDIX ITR-SBC-13STATE

011205
days. The Parties will meet to resolve and mutually agree to the disposition of
the TGSR.
8.3.2.1.4 If SBC-13STATE does not receive an ASR, or if CLEC does not respond to the
TGSR by scheduling a joint discussion within the twenty (20) business day
period, SBC-13STATE will attempt to contact CLEC to schedule a joint
planning discussion. If CLEC will not agree to meet within an additional five (5)
business days and present adequate reason for keeping trunks operational,
SBC-13STATE reserves the right to issue ASRs to resize the Local Only Trunk
Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, or Meet Point Trunk Groups.
8.3.3 Trunk Servicing – SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Exceptions
8.3.3.1 The Parties will process trunk service requests submitted via a properly completed ASR
within ten (10) business days of receipt of such ASR unless defined as a major project.
Incoming orders will be screened by SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE trunk
engineering personnel for reasonableness based upon current utilization and/or
consistency with forecasts. If the nature and necessity of an order requires determination,
the ASR will be placed in held status, and a Joint Planning discussion conducted. Parties
agree to expedite this discussion in order to minimize delay in order processing. Extension
of this review and discussion process beyond two days from ASR receipt will require the
ordering Party to Supplement the order with proportionally adjusted Customer Desired Due
Dates. Facilities must also be in place before trunk orders can be completed.
8.4 Projects require the coordination and execution of multiple orders or related activities between and among
SBC-13STATE and CLEC work groups, including but not limited to the initial establishment of Local Only,
Local Interconnection or Meet Point Trunk Groups and service in an area, NXX code moves, re-homes,
facility grooming, or network rearrangements.
8.4.1 Orders that comprise a project, i.e. greater than four (4) DS1s, shall be submitted at the same time,
and their implementation shall be jointly planned and coordinated.
8.5 Projects-Tandem Rehomes/Switch Conversion/Major Network Projects
8.5.1 SBC-13STATE will advise CLEC of all projects significantly affecting CLEC trunking. Such
Projects may include Tandem Rehomes, Switch Conversions and other major network changes.
An Accessible Letter with project details will be issued at least 6 months prior to the project due
dates. SBC 13-STATE will follow with a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) approximately 4 to
6 months before the due date of the project. A separate TGSR will be issued for each CLEC trunk
group and will specify the required CLEC ASR issue date. Failure to submit ASR(s) by the required
date may result in SBC-13STATE ceasing to deliver traffic until the ASR(s) are received and
processed.
9. TRUNK DATA EXCHANGE: SBC-13STATE
9.1 The Parties agree to exchange traffic data on two-way trunk groups and to implement such an exchange
within three (3) months of the date that two-way trunking is established and the trunk groups begin passing
live traffic, or another date is agreed to by the Parties.
9.2 Exchange of traffic data enables each Party to make accurate and independent assessments of trunk group
service levels and requirements. The Parties may agree to establish a timeline for implementing an
exchange of traffic data utilizing the DIXC process via a Network Data Mover (NDM) or FTP computer to
computer file transfer process. Implementation shall be within three (3) months of the date, or such date as
agreed upon, that the trunk groups begin passing live traffic. The traffic data to be exchanged will be the
Originating Attempt Peg Count, Usage (measured in Hundred Call Seconds), Overflow Peg Count, and
Maintenance Usage (measured in Hundred Call Seconds on a seven (7) day per week, twenty-four (24)
hour per day, fifty-two (52) weeks per year basis). The Parties agree that twenty (20) business days is the

study period duration objective. However, on occasion a study period may be less than twenty (20)
business days but at minimum must be at least three (3) business days to be utilized for engineering
purposes, although with less statistical confidence. For SBC originated one-way, or for any two-way trunk
groups, these reports can be made available weekly upon request.
9.3 A trunk group utilization report (TIKI) is available upon request. The report is provided in an MS-Excel
format.
10. NETWORK MANAGEMENT: SBC-13STATE
10.1 Restrictive Controls
10.1.1 Either Party may use protective network traffic management controls such as 7-digit and 10-digit
code gaps set at appropriate levels on traffic toward each other's network, when required, to
protect the public switched network from congestion due to facility failures, switch congestion, or
failure or focused overload. CLEC and SBC-13STATE will immediately notify each other of any
protective control action planned or executed.
10.2 Expansive Controls
10.2.1 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be implemented by
either Party to temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling
patterns. Reroutes will not be used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Expansive controls will
only be used when mutually agreed to by the Parties.
10.3 Mass Calling
10.3.1 CLEC and SBC-13STATE shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding
cross-network call-ins expected to generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes.
11. OUT OF EXCHANGE TRAFFIC
11.1 Interconnection services are available in accordance with section 251(a)(1) of the Act for the purposes of
exchanging traffic to/from a non-SBC incumbent exchange and consistent with the Appendix Out of
Exchange Traffic.
12. SWITCHED ACCESS TRAFFIC
12.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates from an
end user physically located in one local exchange and delivered for termination to an end user physically
located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing a common mandatory local
calling area as defined in SBC-13STATE’s local exchange tariffs on file with the applicable state
commission) including, without limitation, any traffic that (i) terminates over a Party’s circuit switch,
including traffic from a service that originates over a circuit switch and uses Internet Protocol (IP) transport
technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP transport or multiple providers are involved in
providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the end user’s premises in IP format and is transmitted to
the switch of a provider of voice communication applications or services when such switch utilizes IP
technology and terminates over a Party’s circuit switch. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group
access trunks per the terminating Party’s access tariff(s) and shall be subject to applicable intrastate and
interstate switched access charges; provided, however, the following categories of Switched Access Traffic
are not subject to the above stated requirement relating to routing over feature group access trunks:
(i) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC end user that obtains local dial tone from
CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the intraLATA toll provider,
(ii) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an SBC end user that obtains local dial tone from
SBC where SBC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the intraLATA toll provider;

011205
(iii) Switched Access Traffic delivered to SBC from an Interexchange Carrier (IXC) where the terminating
number is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the Local Number Portability (LNP)
query; and/or
(iv) Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a third party competitive local exchange carrier
over interconnection trunk groups carrying Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic (hereinafter
referred to as “Local Interconnection Trunk Groups”) destined to the other Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies,
and arguments relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the
Parties prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the
Petition for Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from
Access Charges, WC Docket No. 01-361(Released April 21, 2004).
12.2 In the limited circumstances in which a third party competitive local exchange carrier delivers Switched
Access Traffic as described in Section 12.1 (iv) above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups, such Party may deliver such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups. If it is determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups, the terminating Party may object to the delivery of such traffic by providing
written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions and request removal of such traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with
the goal of removing such traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has
not removed or is unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 12.1(iv) above
from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the other party,
the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the applicable Commission
to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such interconnection trunks up to and including
the right to block such traffic and to obtain compensation, if appropriate, from the third party competitive
local exchange carrier delivering such traffic to the extent it is not blocked.

AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
NEUTRAL TANDEM-GEORGIA, LLC
BELLSOUTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS, LLC d/b/a AT&T GEORGIA
This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Interconnection Agreement by and between BellSouth
Telecommunications, LLC d/b/a AT&T Georgia (“AT&T Georgia”) and Neutral Tandem-Georgia, LLC (“Neutral Tandem” or
“CLEC”). AT&T Georgia and CLEC are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party”.
WHEREAS, AT&T Georgia and CLEC are parties to an Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and 252 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), approved July 10, 2009 and as subsequently amended (the
“Agreement”); and
WHEREAS, Neutral Tandem will be acting as a numbering partner for certain interconnected VoIP providers (“IVPs”) in
connection with the numbering trial approved by the FCC in the Direct Access Order, 28 FCC Rcd 5842 (2013). As such,
Neutral Tandem will be delivering traffic to and receiving traffic from AT&T on behalf of IVP for the duration of the trial.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to
amend the Agreement as follows:
1. The Recitals are incorporated into this Amendment.
2. During the trial AT&T Georgia and Neutral Tandem will interconnect, exchange traffic and maintain compensation for IVP
traffic as if it were traffic to or from Neutral Tandem’ end users as provided for in the Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
after conclusion of the trial, Neutral Tandem and AT&T Georgia shall no longer exchange traffic destined to or originating
from IVPs, pursuant to this Agreement.
3. By agreeing to exchange IVP traffic pursuant to this Agreement for the duration of the trial, neither Party waives and each
Party expressly reserves its respective advocacy positions regarding the appropriate means of interconnection, traffic
exchange and intercarrier compensation for traffic exchanged between the Parties.
4. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
5. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying Agreement
(including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with respect to any
orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated
into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
6. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall be
coterminous with such Agreement.
7. This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval by the Georgia Public Service Commission (“Commission”)
and shall become effective one (1) day following filing with such Commission. If the Commission rejects this Amendment,
the Parties shall consult promptly to see if the Commission’s concerns can be resolved. If not, then this Amendment shall
be null and void and the rights and responsibilities of the parties with regard to IVP traffic shall be as set forth in their
current Interconnection Agreement. In such event, the Parties shall cooperate to minimize the possibility that any
required changes will disrupt service to consumers or other service providers.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.

Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
Page 38 of 98

Contract Id: 4924919
Attachment – OS/DA – Exhibit B/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 9
Page 23 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect

Attachment – OS/DA – Exhibit B/AT&T-21STATE
Page 6 of 9
Page 24 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.

Attachment – OS/DA – Exhibit B/AT&T-21STATE
Page 7 of 9
Page 25 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users, non-discriminatory access to
listings, as described herein.
4.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will meet state requirements to make available listings through itself or a contracted vendor
to provide listings for its ILEC Territory, as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.2.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-
Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs
and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not provide a resale discount for
any listings.

Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 Distribution of Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy per primary End
User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages directory in the
same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-21STATE’s
subscribers.
4.2.4 AT&T-21STATE shall direct its publishing vendor to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the “Information
Pages”, or comparable section of its white pages directories (covering the territory where CLEC is certified
to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair, customer service and
billing information.
4.2.5 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.5.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
4.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber

to represent their relationship as any form of agency, partnership or joint venture.
4.2.8 Breach of Contract:
4.2.8.1 If either Party is found to have materially breached the Listings terms of this Attachment, the non-
breaching Party may terminate the Listings terms of this Attachment by providing written Notice to
the breaching Party, whereupon this Attachment shall be null and void with respect to any issue of

written Notice. CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE and/or its
Affiliates and vendor as a result of such CLEC breach.
4.2.9 General Conditions for Listings:
4.2.9.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to suspend, modify or terminate,
without penalty, any Listings Service offerings that are provided under this Attachment on ninety

WHEREAS, Onvoy desires to terminate its Agreements with AT&T, as contained in Exhibit B;
WHEREAS, Onvoy represents that it has authority to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements;
WHEREAS, Onvoy desires to continue to purchase services from AT&T under the Neutral Tandem Agreements;
WHEREAS, AT&T and Onvoy agree to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements to reflect the name change to Onvoy,

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Amendment, certain services being provided today by AT&T to Onvoy
will subsequently be provided by AT&T to Onvoy under the Neutral Tandem Agreements, as amended, including by way of
name change from Neutral Tandem to Onvoy.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, AT&T and Onvoy agree
to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements as follows:
1. This Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals, the terms and conditions, contained within, Exhibit A – Listing of
Neutral Tandem’s Agreements and Exhibit B – Listing of Onvoy, LLC’s Agreements immediately following, all of which are
hereby incorporated in this Amendment by this reference and constitute a part of this Amendment.
2. Upon the Effective date of this amendment for each state, Onvoy’s Agreement for the respective state, as listed in Exhibit
B, is hereby superseded.
3. The Neutral Tandem Agreements are hereby amended to reflect the assignment from “Neutral Tandem” to “Onvoy, LLC”
3.1 AT&T shall reflect the assignment from “Neutral Tandem” to “Onvoy, LLC” only for the main billing account (header
card) for each of the CLEC accounts previously billed to Neutral Tandem. AT&T shall not be obligated, whether
under this Amendment or otherwise, to make any other changes to AT&T records with respect to those accounts
previously billed to Neutral Tandem, including to the services and items provided and/or billed thereunder or under
the Neutral Tandem Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, Onvoy affirms, represents, and warrants that the
ACNA and OCN for those accounts shall not change from that previously used by Neutral Tandem with AT&T for
those accounts and the services and items provided and/or billed thereunder or under the Neutral Tandem
Agreements.
3.2 Once this Amendment is effective, Onvoy shall operate with AT&T under the “Onvoy, LLC” name for those CLEC
accounts previously billed Neutral Tandem. Such operation shall include, by way of example only, submitting orders
under Onvoy, LLC and labeling equipment and facilities installed on AT&T premises after the effective date of this
amendment with “Onvoy, LLC”
4. The Parties agree to continue use of Neutral Tandem’s company codes to the Neutral Tandem Agreements:
ACNA: OWS
OCN: 604E, 348F, 649C, 937C, 067D, 505B, 097D, 205F, 896E, 749E, 543C, 093F, 029F, 638E, 409F, 548E,903C,
225C
SPID: 505B, 604E
5. The Parties agree to assign and use Onvoy’s company codes to the Neutral Tandem Agreements upon the Effective Date
of this Amendment.
ACNA: MSK
OCN: 668G, 301H, 302H, 304H 363F, 213F, 214F, 389H, 267H, 215F, 390H, 914G, 940E

N.6 In addition, CLEC agrees that it is responsible for providing AT&T-21STATE with CLEC’s OCN and ACNA
numbers for the states in which CLEC is authorized to do business and in which CLEC is requesting that this
Agreement apply. In the event that CLEC wants to change and/or add to the OCN and/or ACNA information
in the CLEC Profile, CLEC shall send written notice to AT&T-21STATE to be received at least thirty (30) days
prior to the change and/or addition in accordance with this Section N notice provision; CLEC shall also update
its CLEC Profile through the applicable form and/or web-based interface.
N.6.1 CLEC may not order services under a new account and/or subsequent state certification, established
in accordance with this Section until thirty (30) days after all information specified in this Section is
received from CLEC.
N.6.2 CLEC may be able to place orders for certain services in AT&T-21STATE without having properly
updated the CLEC Profile; however, at any time during the term of this Agreement without additional
notice AT&T may at its discretion eliminate such functionality. At such time, if CLEC has not properly
updated its CLEC Profile, ordering capabilities will cease, and CLEC will not be able to place orders
until thirty (30) days after CLEC has properly updated its CLEC Profile.
N.7 AT&T communicates official information to CLECs via its Accessible Letter, or other applicable, notification
processes. These processes involve electronic transmission and/or posting to the AT&T CLEC Online
website, inclusive of a variety of subjects including declaration of a force majeure, changes on business
processes and policies, and other product/service related notices not requiring an amendment to this
Agreement.
7. This Amendment shall be deemed to revise the terms and provisions of the Neutral Tandem Agreements only to the extent
necessary to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Amendment. In the event of a conflict between the terms and
provisions of this Amendment and the terms and provisions of the Neutral Tandem Agreements (including all incorporated

ordering DS1/DS3 UDT as of the date specified by the FCC and adhere to any FCC-specified
transition timelines.

incorporated by reference as of the effective date of the FCC order and shall not require a written amendment. AT&T

Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Section 251(b)(1) resale services (“Resale Services”) provided by
AT&T-21STATE to CLEC.
1.2 Pursuant to Section 251(b)(1), beginning February 2, 2020, CLEC may order and AT&T-21STATE shall make
available to CLEC for resale, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of this Attachment, Telecommunications
Services that AT&T-21STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not Telecommunications Carriers. Beginning
August 2, 2022, this Attachment shall govern all Resale Services CLEC purchases from AT&T-21STATE, including
Resale Services that were purchased prior to August 2, 2022 pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and/or
resale tariff and that remain in service as of that date (“Resale Embedded Base”).
2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are currently offered to AT&T-21STATE’s End Users at
retail.
2.2 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a retail service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of the state-specific retail
Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that same End User’s existing location;
(iii) both as of the time of that service’s grandfathering.
2.3 AT&T-21STATE may withdraw the availability of certain Telecommunication Services that AT&T-21STATE previously
provisioned to CLEC or retail End Users pursuant to C.F.R 51.325 through 51.335 as such rules may be amended
from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
2.4 CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-21STATE’s corresponding
retail Tariff(s). Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to provide access or interconnection services to
itself, interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), interconnected VoIP
providers (IVPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), or other Telecommunications providers; provided,
however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local exchange telephone service to access IXCs,
wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers. CLEC may not resell any Resale Services to
another CLEC, including its own Affiliate(s).
2.5 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific retail Tariff(s) shall govern the rates, terms and
conditions associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, except for any resale
restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply. CLEC
and its End Users may not use Resale Services in any manner not permitted for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users. Any
change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective
hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.6 CLEC shall only sell Plexar, Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the retail Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is
being offered.
2.7 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-21STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of
Resale Services by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
2.8 CLEC shall only provide Resale Services under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to which AT&T-
21STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).
2.9 Special Needs Services are services for the physically disabled as defined in state-specific Tariffs. Where available
for resale in accordance with state-specific Tariffs, CLEC may resell Special Needs Services to End Users who are

Attachment 16b – Resale 251(b)(1)/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 6
Onvoy, LLC
Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
eligible for each such service. To the extent CLEC provides Resale Services that require certification on the part of
the End User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as established by
the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
2.10 When ordering Resale Services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-21STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original End User service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End User(s) for such offering or promotion. AT&T-21STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each
promotion per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
2.11 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for resale.
Promotions lasting longer than ninety (90) calendar (“Long-Term Promotions”) may be made available for resale.
AT&T 21-STATE may eliminate any Resale Discount on all or certain Long-Term Promotions by providing a 45-day
notice of such elimination.
2.12 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have the breach
cure period as specified in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement to correct the violation and notify
AT&T-21STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected. AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC the greater of:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for the
stated violation; or
(ii) the actual amounts CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation.
2.13 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption or
resale to similarly-situated End Users of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof. Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by
both Parties and approval by the Commission(s).
2.14 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-21STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-21STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-21STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
3.0 PRICING AND DISCOUNTS
3.1 “Resale Discount” means the applicable discount off retail rates applied to AT&T-21STATE Telecommunications
Services resold by CLEC to its End Users. Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable retail
Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
3.2 The Resale Discounts in the underlying Interconnection Agreement will apply until AT&T-21STATE provides
notification of change to the Resale Discounts. AT&T-21STATE will provide such notification at least three (3) months
in advance of any change to current Resale Discounts. Changes to the Resale Discounts will be posted to AT&T
CLEC Online and will be incorporated by reference upon the effective date stated therein. For avoidance of doubt,
changes to Resale Discounts do not apply to Embedded Base Resale until August 2, 2022.
4.0 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-21STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-21STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.

Onvoy, LLC
Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-21STATE may reclaim the End User or
process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-21STATE maintenance
center(s) as provided in the CLEC Online Handbook(s). CLEC End Users calling AT&T-21STATE will be referred to
CLEC at the telephone number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to
authorize CLEC to repair, maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-21STATE’s network facilities, including without
limitation those facilities on End User premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ that activate Call Trace, or who are experiencing annoying calls, should contact law enforcement.
Law Enforcement works with the appropriate AT&T-21STATE operations centers responsible for handling such
requests. AT&T-21STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End Users to provide call records to the proper
authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether
that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against any claim, loss or damage arising from providing
this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the corrective action necessary with its End User
who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-21STATE taking corrective action, up to and including
disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-21STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-21STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
5.0 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF RATES AND CHARGES
5.1 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Attachment, including
but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.
5.1.1 Interexchange carrier traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services messages)
received by AT&T-21STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as unbillable and will
not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those messages to the carrier
indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be billed by AT&T-21STATE.
5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall not be responsible for how the associated charges for Resale Services may be allocated to
End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC under this Attachment
will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for toll and information services (for
example, 900 calls), CLEC must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this
Attachment and pay any applicable charges. It is CLEC’s responsibility to order the appropriate toll
restriction or blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for
certain types of calls, including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Call Completion.
Depending on the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may
bypass blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any
charges associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that
bypass blocking systems.
5.3 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate FCC or Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this

Attachment.
5.4 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
6.0 ANCILLARY SERVICES
6.1 E911 Emergency Service: The terms and conditions for the provision of AT&T-21STATE 911 services are contained
in Attachment 911/E911.
6.2 Payphone Services: CLEC may provide certain local Telecommunications Services to Payphone Service Providers
(PSPs) for PSPs’ use in providing payphone service. Rates for Payphone Services are established under the
provisions of Section 276 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and are not eligible for the Resale Discount
unless required by State Commission order(s). However, given certain billing system limitations, the Resale Discount
may be applied to Payphone Services, unless and until AT&T-21STATE is able to modify its billing system, AT&T-
21STATE may issue true-up bills in accordance with the provisions set forth in the General Terms and Conditions.
7.0 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE
7.1 See applicable Tariff(s) for rates, terms and conditions regarding Suspension of Service.
7.2 AT&T-21STATE will offer Suspension of Service to CLEC for CLEC initiated suspension of service of the CLEC’s
End Users. This service is not considered a Telecommunications Service and will receive no Resale Discount.

Neutral Tandem-New York, LLC, along with each of Neutral Tandem-New York, LLC's
CLEC affiliates, as well as to a carrier adopting such agreement (along with each of
such adopting carrier's CLEC affiliates), in each case for purposes of all of its
arrangements with Verizon operating telephone companies, in all Verizon service
"
territories.

Terms and Conditions
From the Effective Date through May 31,2008,Verizon shall bill, and AT&T shall
pay, the monthly recurring DSO loop charges set forth in Appendix A to this
Attachment 2, which charges shall replace the monthly recurring DSO loop charges
previously set forth in the Agreement for the same loop types in the same service
territories. Appendix A to this Attachment 2may contain rates and charges for
(and/or reference) services, facilities, arrangements and the like that Verizon does not
have an obligation to provide under the Agreement (e.g., services, facilities,
arrangements and the like for which an unbundling requirement does not exist under
47U.S.C.Section 251(c)(3)).Notwithstanding any such rates and/or charges (and/or
references) and, for the avoidance of any doubt, nothing in this Amendment shall be
deemed to require Verizon to provide such a service, facility, arrangement or the like

services that Verizon is required to make available to AT&T for resale pursuant to the
Interconnection Agreements orApplicable Law shall be those discount rates set forth
in Appendix Bto this Attachment 2, notwithstanding any other resale discount rates
that may go into effect in aparticular state, whether by virtue ofa change oflaw or
pursuant to a tariff filed by Verizon. Forthe avoidance ofdoubt, this Amendment
does not affect which services Verizon is obligated to provide to AT&T for resale
under the Interconnection Agreements orApplicable Law, but only the discount rate
at which Verizon makes any such resale service available under Section 251(c)(4)of
the Act.
Notwithstanding any other provision ofthe Interconnection Agreements, this
Amendment, any applicable tariff or SGAT, or otherwise, the terms contained herein
shall govern the relationship ofthe Parties with respect to the subject matter set forth
herein, through May 31,2008, and thereafter as well until such time as such terms are
superseded by a subsequent Interconnection Agreement orInterconnection
Agreement amendment effective after May 31,2008.In case ofthe expiration or

D. Neutral Tandem represents and warrants that it is a certified
provider of local telecommunications service in the State of Florida,
and that its adoption of the Terms will cover services in the State of
Florida only.
In the event an interconnection agreement between Verizon and
Neutral Tandem is currently in effect in the State ofFlorida (the
"Original ICA"), this adoption shall be an amendment and
restatement ofthe operating terms and conditions ofthe Original
ICA, and shall replace in their entirety the terms ofthe Original ICA.
This adoption is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to
create, a novation or accord and satisfaction with respect to the
Original ICA. Any outstanding payment obligations ofthe parties
that were incurred but not fully performed under the Original ICA
shall constitute payment obligations ofthe parties under this
adoption.
Neutral Tandem FLMFN 100605.doc

F. Verizon's standard pricing schedule for interconnection agreements
in the State of Florida (as such schedule may be amended from
time to time) (attached as Appendix A hereto) shall apply to Neutral
Tandem's adoption ofthe Terms. Neutral Tandem should note that
the aforementioned pricing schedule may contain rates for certain
services the terms for which are not included in the Terms or that
are otherwise not part ofthis adoption, and may include phrases or
wording not identical to those utilized in the Terms. In an effort to
expedite the adoption process, Verizon has not deleted such rates
from the pricing schedule or attempted to customize the wording in
the pricing schedule to match the Terms. However, the inclusion of
such rates in no way obligates Verizon to provide the subject
services and in no way waives Verizon's rights, and the use of
different wording or phrasing in the pricing schedule does not alter
the obligations and rights set forth in the Terms.
G. Neutral Tandem's adoption ofthe Terms shall become effective on
November 7, 2005. The parties understand and agree that Verizon
shall file this adoption letter with the Commission promptly upon
receipt ofan original ofthis letter countersigned by Neutral Tandem
as to the points set out in Paragraph One hereof. The term and
termination provisions ofthe Terms shall govern Neutral Tandem's
adoption ofthe Terms. The adoption ofthe Terms is currently
scheduled to expire on September 7, 2006.
As the Terms are being adopted by Neutral Tandem pursuant to Section
252(i) ofthe Act, Verizon does not provide the Terms to you as either a
voluntary or negotiated agreement. The filing and performance by Verizon
ofthe Terms does not in any way constitute a waiver by Verizon ofany
position as to the Terms or a portion thereof, nor does it constitute a
waiver by Verizon ofall rights and remedies it may have to seek review of
the Terms, or to petition the Commission, other administrative body, or
court for reconsideration or reversal ofany determination made by the
Commission pursuant to arbitration in Docket No. 020412-TP, or to seek
review in any way ofany provisions included in the Terms as a result of
Neutral Tandem's adoption ofthe Terms.
Nothing herein shall be construed as or is intended to be a concession or
admission by Verizon that any contractual provision required by the
Commission in Docket No. 020412-TP (the US LEC arbitration) or any
provision in the Terms complies with the rights and duties imposed by the
Act, the decisions ofthe FCC and the Commission, the decisions ofthe
courts, or other law, and Verizon expressly reserves its full right to assert
and pursue claims arising from or related to the Terms.
Neutral Tandem FLMFN 100605.doc

4. Verizon reserves the right to deny Neutral Tandem's application ofthe
Terms, in whole or in part, at any time:
A. when the costs ofproviding the Terms to Neutral Tandem are
greater than the costs of providing them to US LEC;
B. if the provision ofthe Terms to Neutral Tandem is not technically
feasible; and/or
C. to the extent that Verizon otherwise is not required to make the
Terms available to Neutral Tandem under applicable law.
For the avoidance ofany doubt, please note that adoption ofthe Terms
will not result in reciprocal compensation payments for Internet traffic.
Verizon has always taken the position that reciprocal compensation was
not due to be paid for Internet traffic under section 251(b)(5)ofthe Act.
Verizon's position that reciprocal compensation is not to be paid for
Internet traffic was confirmed by the FCC in the Order on Remand and
Report and Order adopted on April 18,2001 ("FCCInternet Order" ),which
held that Internet traffic constitutes "information access" outside the scope
ofthe reciprocal compensation obligations set forth in section 251(b)(5)of
"
the Act. Accordingly, any compensation to be paid for Internet traffic will
be handled pursuant to the terms of the FCC Internet Order, not pursuant
to adoption ofthe Terms. Moreover, in light ofthe FCC Internet Order,
even ifthe Terms include provisions invoking an intercarrier compensation
mechanism for Internet traffic, any reasonable amount oftime permitted
for adopting such provisions has expired under the FCC's rules
implementing section 252(i) ofthe Act. In fact, the FCC Internet Order
made clear that carriers may not adopt provisions of an existing
interconnection agreement to the " extent that such provisions provide
compensation for Internet traffic.
6. Should Neutral Tandem attempt to apply the Terms in a manner that
conflicts with Paragraph Two through Paragraph Five above, Verizon
reserves its rights to seek appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.

terminating minutes) based on UNE local switching rates in the Agreement plus UNE shared
transport and tandem switching (based on factors for percent interoffice and tandem switch
usage, plus assumed transport mileage of 10miles and 2terms) based on UNE shared transport
rates in the Agreement plus UNE Vertical Services charges (optional per line charges, ifallowed
by the Agreement), less $1.39to account for the cost saving from using IDLC technology.

Where the Parties have agreed to convert existing One-Way
Interconnection Trunks to Two-Way Interconnection Trunks, at the
Joint Planning Meeting, the Parties shall also mutually agree on the
conversion process and project intervals for conversion ofsuch One-
Way Interconnection Trunks to Two-Way Interconnection Trunks.
intentionally left blank.
On a semi-annual basis, US LEC shall submit a good faith forecast to
Verizon ofthe number of End Office and Tandem Two-Way
interconnection Trunks that US LEC anticipates Verizon will need to
provide during the ensuing two (2)year period for the exchange of
traffic between US LEC and Verizon. US LEC's trunk forecasts shall
conform to the Verizon CLEC trunk forecasting guidelines as in effect
at that time.
The Parties shall meet (telephonically or in person) from time to time,
as needed, to review data on End Office and Tandem Two-Way
interconnection Trunks to determine the need for new trunk groups
and to plan any necessary changes in the number ofTwo-Way
Interconnection Trunks.
Two-Way interconnection Trunks shall have SS7Common Channel
Signaling. The Parties agree to utilize B8ZS and Extended Super
Frame (ESF)DS1 facilities, where available.
With respect to End Office Two-Way interconnection Trunks, both
Parties shall use an economic Centium Call Second (Hundred Call
Second) equal to five (5).
Two-Way Interconnection Trunk groups that connect to a Verizon
access Tandem shall be engineered using a design blocking objective
ofNeal-Wilkenson B.005during the average time consistent busy
hour. Two-Way Interconnection Trunk groups that connect to a
Verizon local Tandem shall be engineered using a design blocking
objective ofNeal-Wilkenson B.01 during the average time consistent
busy hour. Verizon and US LEC shall engineer Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks using BOC Notes on the LEC Networks SR-
TSV-002275.
The performance standard for final Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
groups shall be that no such Interconnection Trunk group will exceed
its design blocking objective (B.005or B.01,as applicable) for three
(3)consecutive calendar traffic study months.
US LEC shall determine and order the number ofTwo-Way
Interconnection Trunks that are required to meet the applicable design
blocking objective for all traffic carried on each Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk group. US LEC shall order Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks by submitting ASRs to Verizon setting forth the
number ofTwo-Way Interconnection Trunks to be installed and the
requested installation dates within Verizon's effective standard
intervals or negotiated intervals, as appropriate. US LEC shall
complete ASRs in accordance with OBFGuidelines as in effect from
time to time.
55

Verizon may (but shall not be obligated to) monitor Two-Way
Interconnection Groups using service results for the applicable design
blocking objective. IfVerizon observes blocking in excess ofthe
applicable design objective on any Tandem Two-Way Interconnection
Trunk group and US LEC has not notified Verizon that it has corrected
such blocking, Verizon may submit to US LEC a Trunk Group Service
Request directing US LEC to remedy the blocking. Upon receipt ofa
Trunk Group Service Request, US LEC will complete an ASR to
augment the Two-Way Interconnection Trunk Group with excessive
blocking and submit the ASR to Verizon within five (5)Business Days.
The Parties will review all Tandem Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
groups that reach a utilization level ofseventy percent (70'%%d), or
greater, to determine whether those groups should be augmented. US
LECwill promptly augment all Tandem Two-Way Interconnection
Trunk groups that reach a utilization level ofeighty percent (80%%d)by
submitting ASRs for additional trunks sufficient to attain a utilization
level ofapproximately seventy percent (70'/0), unless the Parties agree
that additional trunking is not required. For each Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk group with a utilization level ofless than sixty
percent (60'/0), unless the Parties agree otherwise, US LECwill
promptly submit ASRs to disconnect a sufficient number of
Interconnection Trunks to attain a utilization level ofapproximately
sixty percent (60/0) for each respective group, unless the Parties
agree that the Two-Way Interconnection Trunks should not be
disconnected. In the event US LECfails to submit an ASR for Two-
Way Interconnection Trunks in conformance with this section, Verizon
may bill US LECfor the excess Interconnection Trunks at the
applicable Verizon rates.
Because Verizon will not be in control ofwhen and how many Two-
Way interconnection Trunks are established between its network and
US LEC's network, Verizon's performance in connection with these
Two-Way Interconnection Trunk groups shall not be subject to any
performance measurements and remedies under this Agreement, and,
except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, under any FCC or
Commission approved carrier-to-carrier performance assurance
guidelines or plan.
Upon three (3)months prior written notice and with the mutual
agreement ofthe Parties, either Party may withdraw its traffic from a
Two-Way Interconnection Trunk group and install One-Way
Interconnection Trunks, provided that, ifa Party has failed to comply
with this Agreement with regard to Two-Way interconnection Trunks,
the other Party may upon three (3)months prior written notice and
without mutual agreement ofthe non-complying Party, withdraw its
traffic from a Two-Way Interconnection Trunk group and install One-
Way Interconnection Trunks.
US LECwill route its traffic to Verizon over the End Office and
Tandem Two-Way Interconnection Trunks in accordance with SR-
TAP-000191, including but not limited to those standards requiring that
a call from US LECto a Verizon End Office will first be routed to the
End Office Interconnection Trunk group between US LEC and the
Verizon End Office.

Alternative Interconnection Arrangements
3. 1 In addition to the foregoing methods of Interconnection, and subject to mutual
agreement ofthe Parties, the Parties may agree to establish a Fiber Meet
arrangement, which may include a SONET backbone with an optical interface at
the OC-n level in accordance with the terms ofthis Section.
3.2 The establishment ofany Fiber Meet arrangement is expressly conditioned upon
the Parties' reaching prior written agreement on routing, appropriate sizing and
forecasting, equipment, ordering, provisioning, maintenance, repair, testing,
augment, and compensation, procedures and arrangements, reasonable
distance limitations, and on any other arrangements necessary to implement the
Fiber Meet arrangement.
3.3 Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, Fiber Meet arrangements shall be
used only for the termination of Reciprocal Compensation Traffic, Measured
Internet Traffic, and IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
Initiating Interconnection
4. 1 IfUS LEC determines to offer Telephone Exchange Services and to interconnect
with Verizon in any LATA in which Verizon also offers Telephone Exchange
Services and in which the Parties are not already interconnected pursuant to this
Agreement, US LEC shall provide written notice to Verizon ofthe need to
establish Interconnection in such LATA pursuant to this Agreement.
4.2 The notice provided in Section 4. 1 shall include (a)the initial Routing Point(s); (b)
the applicable technically feasible Interconnection Point(s) on Verizon's network
to be established in the relevant LATA in accordance with this Agreement; (c)US
LEC's intended Interconnection activation date; (d) a forecast of US LEC's
trunking requirements conforming to Section 14.3;and (e)such other information
as Verizon shall reasonably request in order to facilitate Interconnection.
4.3 The interconnection activation date in the new LATA shall be mutually agreed to
by the Parties after receipt by Verizon ofall necessary information as indicated
above. Within ten (10)Business Days ofVerizon's receipt of US LEC's notice
provided for in Section 4.1,Verizon and US LEC shall confirm the technically
feasible Interconnection Point on Verizon's network in the new LATA and the
mutually agreed upon Interconnection activation date for the new LATA.

5.2.2 When One-Way or Two-Way Interconnection Trunks are provisioned
using a DS-3 interface facility, then US LEC shall order the multiplexed
DS-3facilities to the Verizon Central Office that is designated in the
NECA 4Tariff as an intermediate Hub location, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Verizon. The specific NECA 4 Intermediate
Hub location to be used for One-Way or Two-Way Interconnection
Trunks shall be in the appropriate Tandem subtending area based on
the LERG. In the event the appropriate DS-3 intermediate Hub is not
used, then US LEC shall pay 100%ofthe facility charges for the One-
Way orTwo-Way Interconnection Trunks.
5.2.3 Each Party will identify its Carrier identification Code, a three or four
digit numeric code obtained from Telcordia, to the other Party when
ordering a trunk group.
5.2.4 Unless mutually agreed to by both Parties, each Party will outpulse ten
(10)digits to the other Party.
5.2.5 Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to monitor trunk
groups under its control and to augment those groups using generally
accepted trunk engineering standards so as to not exceed blocking
objectives. Each Party agrees to use modular trunk engineering
techniques for trunks subject to this Attachment.
5.3 Switchin S stem Hierarch and Trunkin Re uirements.
For purposes ofrouting US LEC traffic to Verizon, the subtending arrangements
between Verizon Tandem Switches and Verizon End Office Switches shall be the
same as the Tandem/End Office subtending arrangements Verizon maintains for
the routing ofits own or other carriers' traffic. For purposes ofrouting Verizon
traffic to US LEC, the subtending arrangements between US LECTandem
Switches and US LEC End Office Switches shall be the same as the
Tandem/End Office subtending arrangements that US LEC maintains for the
routing ofits own or other carriers' traffic.
5.4
Each Party will provide the other Party with access to its databases and
associated signaling necessary for the routing and completion ofthe other
Party's traffic in accordance with the provisions contained in the Unbundled
Network Element Attachment or applicable access tariff.
5.5 Grades ofService.
The Parties shall initially engineer and shall monitor and augment all trunk
groups consistent with the Joint Process as set forth in Section 14.1.
Traffic Measurement and Billing over Interconnection Trunks
6. 1 For billing purposes, each Party shall pass Calling Party Number (CPN)
information on calls carried over the Interconnection Trunks.
6.1. 1 As used in this Section 6, "Traffic Rate" means the applicable
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic rate, Measured Internet Traffic rate,
intrastate Switched Exchange Access Service rate, interstate Switched
Exchange Access Service rate, or intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
58

5.
i

Traffic rate, as provided in the Pricing Attachment, an applicable Tariff,
or, for Measured Internet Traffic, the FCC Internet Order.
6.1.2 Iffor any monthly period the originating Party passes CPN on ninety
percent (90'/0) or more ofits calls, the other Party (" Billing Party")may
bill the originating Party the Local Traffic call completion rate,
intrastate Switched Exchange Access Service rates,
intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit Traffic rates, or interstate
Switched Exchange Access Service rates applicable to each minute of
traffic, as provided in Attachment A and applicable Tariffs, forwhich
CPN is passed. For any remaining (up to 10'/0) calls without CPN
information, the Billing Party may bill the originating Party for such
traffic at the Reciprocal Compensation rate, intrastate Switched
Exchange Access Service rates, intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
Traffic rates, or interstate Switched Exchange Access Service rates
applicable to each minute oftraffic, as provided in Attachment A and
applicable Tariffs, in direct proportion to the minutes ofuse ofcalls
passed with CPN information. Iffor any monthly billing period the
originating Party passes CPN on eighty percent {80/o)or more ofits
calls and provides evidence that it passed CPN on ninety percent
(90/0) or more ofits calls for which itwas technically feasible to do so,
the Billing Party may bill the originating Party for traffic without CPN
information at the Local Traffic call completion rate, intrastate
Switched Exchange Access rates, intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
Traffic rates, or interstate Switched Exchange Access rates, applicable
to each minute oftraffic, as provided in Attachment A and applicable
Tariffs, in direct proportion to the minutes ofuse ofcalls passed with
CPN information.
6.1.3 Ifthe originating Party fails to pass CPN at the levels set forth in
section 6.1.2 the Billing Party may bill the higher ofits interstate
Switched Exchange Access Service rates or its intrastate Switched
Exchange Access Services rates for all traffic that is passed without
CPN, unless the Parties agree that other rates should apply to such
traffic.
6.2 At such time as a Billing Party has the capability, on an automated basis, to use
such CPN to classify traffic delivered over Interconnection Trunks by the other
Party by Traffic Rate type (e.g., Reciprocal Compensation Traffic/Measured
Internet Traffic, intrastate Switched Exchange Access Service, interstate
Switched Exchange Access Service, or intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
Traffic), such Billing Party may bill the originating Party the Traffic Rate
applicable to each relevant minute oftraffic for which CPN is passed. Ifthe
Billing Party lacks the capability, on an automated basis, to use CPN information
on an automated basis to classify traffic delivered by the other Party by Traffic
Rate type, the originating Party will supply Traffic Factor 1 and Traffic Factor 2.
The Traffic Factors shall be supplied in writing by the originating Party within
thirty (30)days ofthe Effective Date and shall be updated in writing by the
originating Party quarterly. Measurement ofbilling minutes for purposes of
determining terminating compensation shall be in conversation seconds (the time
in seconds that the Parties equipment is used for a completed call, measured
from the receipt ofanswer supervision to the receipt ofdisconnect supervision).
Measurement ofbilling minutes for originating toll free service access code {eg..,
800/888/877) calls shall be in accordance with applicable Tariffs. Determinations
as to whether traffic is Reciprocal Compensation Traffic or Measured Internet
Traffic shall be made in accordance with Section 7.3.2. 1 below.
59

C

6.3 Each Party, at its own expense, reserves the right to audit all Traffic, up to a
maximum oftwo audits per calendar year, to ensure that rates are being applied
appropriately; provided, however, that either Party shall have the right to conduct
additional audit(s) ifthe preceding audit disclosed material errors or
discrepancies. Each Party agrees to provide the necessary Traffic data in
conjunction with any such audit in a timely manner.
6.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either Party's ability to
designate the areas within which that Party's Customers may make calls which
that Party rates as "local" in its Customer Tariffs.
Reciprocal Compensation Arrangements Pursuant to Section 251(b)(5)ofthe Act
7. 1 Intentionally Left Blank.
7.2 Reci rocal Com ensation.
The Parties shall exchange Reciprocal Compensation Traffic at the
Interconnection Point(s) designated in accordance with the terms ofthis
Agreement. The Party originating Reciprocal Compensation Traffic shall
compensate the terminating Party for the transport and termination ofsuch traffic
to its Customer in accordance with Section 251(b)(5)ofthe Act at the equal and
symmetrical rates stated in the Pricing Attachment; it being understood and
agreed that Verizon shall charge (and US LEC shall pay Verizon) the End Office
Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the Pricing Attachment for Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic US LEC physically delivers to an Interconnection Point at
the Verizon Wire Center in which the terminating Verizon End Office is located,
and otherwise that Verizon shall charge (US LEC shall pay Verizon) the Tandem
Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the Pricing Attachment for Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic US LEC delivers to Verizon; it also being understood and
agreed that US LEC shall charge (and Verizon shall pay US LEC)the End Office
Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the Pricing Attachment for Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic Verizon delivers to US LEC, unless Verizon is required
under Applicable Law to pay the Tandem Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth
in the Pricing Attachment. These rates are to be applied at the Interconnection
Point(s) at which the Parties interconnect, whether such traffic is delivered by
Verizon for termination by US LEC, or delivered by US LECfor termination by
Verizon. No additional charges shall be assessed by the terminating Party for
the transport and termination ofsuch traffic from the Interconnection Point(s) to
its Customer; provided, however, for the avoidance ofany doubt, ifUS LEC
establishes a Collocation arrangement at a Verizon Wire Center as its method of
interconnection, US LEC shall also pay Verizon, at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Attachment, for any Collocation related Services that US LEC obtains
from Verizon. When such Reciprocal Compensation Traffic is delivered over the
same Interconnection Trunks as Toll Traffic, any port, multiplexing, transport or
other applicable access charges related to the delivery ofToll Traffic from the
Interconnection Point to the terminating Party's Customer shall be prorated so as
to apply only to the Toll Traffic. The designation oftraffic as Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic for purposes ofReciprocal Compensation shall be based
on the actual originating and terminating points ofthe complete end-to-end
communication.
7.3 Traffic Not Sub'ect to Reci rocal Com ensation.
60

Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to interstate or intrastate
Exchange Access, Information Access, or exchange services for
Exchange Access or Information Access.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to internet Traffic.
7.3.2. 1 The determination ofwhether traffic is Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic or Internet Traffic shall be performed
in accordance with Paragraphs 8 and 79, and other
applicable provisions, ofthe FCC Internet Order (including,
but not limited to, in accordance with the rebuttable
presumption established by the FCC Internet Order that
traffic delivered to a carrier that exceeds a 3:1ratio of
terminating to originating traffic is Internet Traffic, and in
accordance with the process established by the FCC
internet Order for rebutting such presumption before the
Commission).
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Toll Traffic, including, but
not limited to, calls originated on a 1+presubscription basis, or on a
casual dialed (10XXX/101XXXX)basis.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Optional Extended Local
Calling Area Traffic.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to special access, private
line, or any other traffic that is not switched by the terminating Party.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Tandem Transit Traffic.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Voice Information Service
Traffic (as defined in Section 5ofthe Additional Services Attachment),
except for non-Toll Traffic to vocal discussion programs open to the
public, as set forth in the Arbitration Order.
Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Virtual Foreign Exchange
Traffic (i.e. , V/FX Traffic), or as set forth in the Arbitration Order, to
Foreign Exchange Traffic (i.e. , FXTraffic). As used in this Agreement,
"Virtual Foreign Exchange Traffic" or "V/FX Traffic" is defined as calls
in which a Customer is assigned a telephone number with an NXX
Code (as set forth in the LERG) associated with an exchange that is
different than the exchange (as set forth in the LERG) associated with
the actual physical location ofsuch Customer's station. As used in this
Agreement, "Foreign Exchange Traffic or "FXTraffic" is defined as
calls in which exchange service is furnished to a Customer from an
exchange (the "foreign exchange") other than the one from which the
Customer would normally be served, and such service is provided via
dedicated facilities from the Customer's premises to the foreign
exchange office. For the avoidance ofany doubt, (i)where US LEC is
the V/FX or FXservice provider, US LEC shall pay Verizon's
originating access charges for all traffic originated by a Verizon
Customer to the V/FX or FXnumber ofa US LEC Customer, and (ii)
where Verizon is the V/FX or FXservice provider, Verizon shall pay US
LEC's originating access charges for all traffic originated by a US LEC
Customer to the V/FX or FXnumber ofa Verizon Customer.

7.4 The Reciprocal Compensation rates (including, but not limited to, the Reciprocal
Compensation per minute ofuse charges) billed by US LEC to Verizon shall not
exceed the Reciprocal Compensation rates (including, but not limited to,
Reciprocal Compensation per minute ofuse charges) billed by Verizon to US
LEC.
Other Types ofTraffic
8. 1 Notwithstanding any other provision ofthis Agreement or any Tariff: (a)the
Parties' rights and obligations with respect to any intercarrier compensation that
may be due in connection with their exchange of Internet Traffic shall be
governed by the terms ofthe FCC Internet Order and other applicable FCC
orders and FCC Regulations; and, (b) a Party shall not be obligated to pay any
intercarrier compensation for Internet Traffic that is in excess ofthe intercarrier
compensation for Internet Traffic that such Party is required to pay under the
FCC Internet Order and other applicable FCC orders and FCC Regulations.
8.2 Subject to Section 8.1 above, interstate and intrastate Exchange Access,
information Access, exchange services for Exchange Access or Information
Access, and Toll Traffic, shall be governed by the applicable provisions ofthis
Agreement and applicable Tariffs.
8.3 For any traffic originating with a third party carrier and delivered by US LECto
Verizon, US LEC shall pay Verizon the same amount that such third party carrier
would have been obligated to pay Verizon for termination ofthat traffic at the
location the traffic is delivered to Verizon by US LEC.
8.4 Any traffic not specifically addressed in this Agreement shall be treated as
required by the applicable Tariff ofthe Party transporting and/or terminating the
traffic.
8.5 Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties, the Parties shall also
exchange Measured Internet Traffic at the interconnection Point(s) established
hereunder for the exchange of Reciprocal Compensation Traffic. Any intercarrier
compensation that may be due in connection with the Parties' exchange of
Measured Internet Traffic shall be applied at such Interconnection Point in
accordance with the FCC internet Order.
Transmission and Routing of Exchange Access Traffic

Section 9prescribes parameters for certain trunks to be established over the
Interconnections specified in Sections 2 through 5ofthis Attachment for the
transmission and routing oftraffic between US LEC Telephone Exchange
Service Customers and Interexchange Carriers ("Access Toll Connecting
Trunks" ), in any case where US LEC elects to have its End Office Switch subtend
a Verizon Tandem. This includes casually-dialed (1010XXXand 101XXXX)
traffic,
9.2 Access Toll Conn ectin Trunk Grou Architecture.
9.2.1 if US LEC chooses to subtend a Verizon access Tandem, US LEC's
NPA/NXX must be assigned by US LEC to subtend the same Verizon
62

access Tandem that a Verizon NPA/NXX serving the same Rate
Center Area subtends as identified in the LERG.
9.2.2 US LEC shall establish Access Toll Connecting Trunks pursuant to
applicable access Tariffs by which itwill provide Switched Exchange
Access Services to Interexchange Carriers to enable such
Interexchange Carriers to originate and terminate traffic to and from
US LEC's Customers.
9.2.3 The Access Toll Connecting Trunks shall be two-way trunks. Such
trunks shall connect the End Office US LEC utilizes to provide
Telephone Exchange Service and Switched Exchange Access to its
Customers in a given LATA to the Tandem Verizon utilizes to provide
Exchange Access in such LATA.
9.2.4 Access Toll Connecting Trunks shall be used solely for the
transmission and routing of Exchange Access to allow US LEC's
Customers to connect to or be connected to the interexchange trunks
ofany lnterexchange Carrier which is connected to a Verizon access
tandem.
10. Meet-Point Billing Arrangements
10. 1 US LEC and Verizon will establish Meet-Point Billing (MPB) arrangements in
order to provide a common transport option to Switched Exchange Access
Services customers via a Verizon access Tandem Switch in accordance with the
Meet Point Billing guidelines contained in the OBF's MECAB and MECOD
documents, except as modified herein, and in Verizon's applicable Tariffs. The
arrangements described in this Section 10are intended to be used to provide
Switched Exchange Access Service where the transport component ofthe
Switched Exchange Access Service is routed through an access Tandem Switch
that is provided by Verizon.
10.2 In each LATA, the Parties shall establish MPB arrangements for the applicable
US LEC Routing Point/Verizon Serving Wire Center combinations.
10.3 interconnection for the MPB arrangement shall occur at the Verizon access
Tandems in the LATA, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.
10.4 US LEC and Verizon will use reasonable efforts, individually and collectively, to
maintain provisions in their respective state access Tariffs, and/or provisions
within the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any
successor Tariff sufficient to reflect the MPB arrangements established pursuant
to this Agreement.
10.5 In general, there are four alternative Meet-Point Billing arrangements possible,
which are: Single Bill/Single Tariff, Multiple Bill/Single Tariff, Multiple Bill/Multiple
Tariff, and Single Bill/Multiple Tariff, as outlined in the OBF MECAB Guidelines.
Each Party shall implement the "Multiple Bill/Single Tariff" or "Multiple Bill/Multiple
Tariff" option, as appropriate, in order to bill an IXCfor the portion ofthe MPB
arrangement provided by that Party. Alternatively, in former Bell Atlantic service
areas, upon agreement ofthe Parties, each Party may use the New York State
Access Pool on its behalf to implement the Single Bill/Multiple Tariff or Single
Bill/Single Tariff option, as appropriate, in order to bill an IXCfor the portion of
the MPB arrangement provided by that Party.

J.

The rates to be billed by each Party for the portion ofthe MPB arrangement
provided by it shall be as set forth in that Party's applicable Tariffs, or other
document that contains the terms under which that Party's access services are
offered. For each US LEC Routing Point/Verizon Serving Wire Center
combination, the MPB billing percentages for transport between the US LEC
Routing Point and the Verizon Serving Wire Center shall be calculated in
accordance with the formula set forth in Section 10.17.
Each Party shall provide the other Party with the billing name, billing address,
and Carrier identification Code (CIC) ofthe IXC, and identification ofthe Verizon
Wire Center serving the IXC in order to comply with the MPB notification process
as outlined in the MECAB document.
Verizon shall provide US LECwith the Switched Access Detail Usage Data (EMI
category 1101XXrecords) on magnetic tape or via such other media as the
Parties may agree to, no later than ten (10)Business Days after the date the
usage occurred.
US LEC shall provide Verizon with the Switched Access Summary Usage Data
(EMI category 1150XXrecords) on magnetic tape or via such other media as the
Parties may agree, no later than ten (10)Business Days after the date ofits
rendering ofthe bill to the relevant IXC,which bill shall be rendered no less
frequently than monthly.
All usage data to be provided pursuant to Sections 10.8 and 10.9shall be sent to
the following addresses:

Either Party may change its address for receiving usage data by notifying the
other Party in writing pursuant to Section 29 ofthe General Terms and
Conditions.
US LEC and Verizon shall coordinate and exchange the billing account reference
(BAR) and billing account cross reference (BACR) numbers or Operating
Company Number ("OCN"), as appropriate, for the MPB arrangements described
in this Section 10. Each Party shall notify the other ifthe level ofbilling or other
BAR/BACR elements change, resulting in a new BAR/BACR number, or ifthe
OCN changes.
Each Party agrees to provide the other Party with notification ofany errors it
discovers in MPB data within thirty (30)calendar days ofthe receipt ofthe
original data. The other Party shall attempt to correct the error and resubmit the
data within ten (10)Business Days ofthe notification. In the event the errors
64

t)
O

cannot be corrected within such ten- (10)Business-Day period, the erroneous
data will be considered lost. In the event ofa loss ofdata, whether due to
uncorrectable errors or otherwise, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the
lost data and, ifsuch reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable
estimate ofthe lost data based upon prior usage data.
10.13 Either Party may request a review or audit ofthe various components ofaccess
recording up to a maximum oftwo (2)audits per calendar year. All costs
associated with each review and audit shall be borne by the requesting Party.
Such review or audit shall be conducted subject to Section 7ofthe General
Terms and Conditions and during regular business hours. A Party may conduct
additional audits, at its expense, upon the other Party's consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.14 Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section
10shall create any liability for damages, losses, claims, costs, injuries, expenses
or other liabilities whatsoever on the part ofeither Party.
10.15 MPB will apply for all traffic bearing the 500, 900,toll free service access code
(e.g.800/888/877) (to the extent provided by an IXC)or any other non-
geographic NPA which may be designated for such traffic in the future.
10.16 In the event US LEC determines to offer Telephone Exchange Services in a
LATA in which Verizon operates an access Tandem Switch, Verizon shall permit
and enable US LEC to subtend the Verizon access Tandem Switch(es)
designated for the Verizon End Offices in the area where there are located US
LEC Routing Point(s) associated with the NPA NXX(s) to/from which the
Switched Exchange Access Services are homed.
10.1? Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, the MPB billing percentages
for each Routing Point/Verizon Serving Wire Center combination shall be
calculated according to the following formula, unless as mutually agreed to by the
Parties:
a / (a +b) US LEC Billing Percentage
and
b / (a +b) Verizon Billing Percentage
where:
a = the airline mileage between US LEC Routing Point and the
actual point ofinterconnection for the MPB arrangement; and
b = the airline mileage between the Verizon Serving Wire Center and
the actual point ofinterconnection for the MPB arrangement.
10.18 US LEC shall inform Verizon ofeach LATA in which it intends to offer Telephone
Exchange Services and its calculation ofthe billing percentages which should
apply for such arrangement. Within ten (10)Business Days ofUS LEC's delivery
ofnotice to Verizon, Verizon and US LEC shall confirm the Routing Point/Verizon
Serving Wire Center combination and billing percentages.
11. Toll Free Service Access Code (e.g.,800/888/877) Traffic
The following terms shall apply when either Party delivers toll free service access code
65

(e.g., 800/877/888)("8YY") calls to the other Party. For the purposes ofthis Section 11,
the terms "translated" and "untranslated" refers to those toll free service access code
calls that have been queried ("translated" )or have not been queried ("untranslated" )to
an 8YYdatabase. Except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all then US LEC
originating "untranslated" 8YYtraffic will be routed over a separate one-way trunk group.
11. 1 When US LEC delivers translated 8YYcalls to Verizon for completion,
11.1. 1 to an IXC, US LEC shall:
11.1.1. 1 provide an appropriate EMI record to Verizon for processing
and Meet Point Billing in accordance with Section 10above;
and
11.1.1.2 bill the IXCthe US LEC query charge associated with the
call.
11.1.2 to Verizon or another LEC that is a toll free service access code
service provider in the LATA, US LEC shall:
11.1.2. 1 provide an appropriate EMI record to the toll free service
access code service provider; and

Tandem Transit Traffic
12.1 As used in this Section 12,Tandem Transit Traffic is Telephone Exchange
Service traffic that originates on US LEC's network, and is transported through a
Verizon Tandem to the Central Office ofa CLEC, ILEC other than Verizon,
Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) carrier, or other LEC, that subtends
the relevant Verizon Tandem to which US LECdelivers such traffic. Neither the
originating nor terminating customer is a Customer ofVerizon. Subtending
Central Offices shall be determined in accordance with and as identified in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG). Switched Exchange Access Service
traffic is not Tandem Transit Traffic.
12.2 Tandem Transit Traffic Service provides US LECwith the transport ofTandem
Transit Traffic as provided below.
12.3 Tandem Transit Traffic may be routed over the Interconnection Trunks described
in Sections 3through 6. US LEC shall deliver each Tandem Transit Traffic call to
Verizon with CCS and the appropriate Transactional Capabilities Application Part
("TCAP")message to facilitate full interoperability ofCLASS Features and billing
functions.
12.4 US LEC shall exercise its best efforts to enter into a reciprocal Telephone
Exchange Service traffic arrangement (either via written agreement or mutual
Tariffs) with any CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC, to which it delivers
Telephone Exchange Service traffic that transits Verizon's Tandem Office.
12.5 US LEC shall pay Verizon for Transit Service that US LEC originates at the rate
specified in the Pricing Attachment, plus any additional charges or costs the
CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC, imposes or levies on Verizon for the
delivery or termination ofsuch traffic, including any Switched Exchange Access
Service charges.
12.6 Verizon will not be required to provide Tandem Transit Traffic Services for local
Tandem Transit Traffic to be delivered to a CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other
LEC, ifthe volume oflocal Tandem Transit Traffic to be delivered to the CLEC,
ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC exceeds one (1)DS-1 level volume ofcalls
per CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC per Verizon tandem serving area
for a period ofthree consecutive months. Prior to the threshold being reached,
US LEC and the relevant 3rd party shall negotiate agreements to establish direct
connections, so that these direct connections can be made available when the
threshold has been exceeded for 60days. Once the first directly connected DS-1
67

is installed to a CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC, overflow traffic may
traverse the Verizon tandem to that entity until such time that the level of
overflow traffic meets the requirements specified in this Section 12.6addressing
the need for an additional DS-1. Each subsequent need for an additional DS-1
will be handled in a like manner.
12.7 Iforwhen a third party carrier's Central Office subtends a US LEC Central Office,
then US LEC shall offer to Verizon a service arrangement equivalent to or the
same as Tandem Transit Service provided by Verizon to US LEC as defined in
this Section 12such that Verizon may terminate calls to a Central Office ofa
CLEC, ILEC, CMRS carrier, or other LEC, that subtends a US LEC Central Office
("Reciprocal Tandem Transit Service"). US LECshall offer such Reciprocal
Transit Service arrangements under terms and conditions no less favorable than
those provided in this Section 12.
12.8 Neither Party shall take any actions to prevent the other Party from entering into
a direct and reciprocal traffic exchange agreement with any carrier to which it
originates, or from which it terminates, traffic.
Number Resources, Rate Center Areas and Routing Points
13. 1 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely
affect in any manner either Party's right to employ or to request and be assigned
any Central Office Codes ("NXX")pursuant to the Central Office Code
Assignment Guidelines and any relevant FCC or Commission orders, as may be
amended from time to time, or to establish, by Tariff or otherwise, Rate Center
Areas and Routing Points corresponding to such NXX codes.
13.2 Itshall be the responsibility ofeach Party to program and update its own
switches and network systems pursuant to information provided on ASRs as well
as the LERG in order to recognize and route traffic to the other Party's assigned
NXX codes. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Party shall
impose any fees or charges whatsoever on the other Party for such activities.
13.3 Unless otherwise required by Commission order, the Rate Center Areas will be
the same for each Party. During the term ofthis Agreement, US LEC shall adopt
the Rate Center Area and Rate Center Points that the Commission has approved
for Verizon within the LATA and Tandem serving area. US LEC shall assign
whole NPA-NXX codes to each Rate Center Area unless otherwise ordered by
the FCC, the Commission or another governmental entity ofappropriate
jurisdiction, or the LEC industry adopts alternative methods ofutilizing NXXs.
13.4 US LECwill also designate a Routing Point for each assigned NXX code. US
LEC shall designate one location for each Rate Center Area in which the US LEC
has established NXX code(s) as the Routing Point for the NPA-NXXs associated
with that Rate Center Area, and such Routing Point shall be within the same
LATA as the Rate Center Area but not necessarily within the Rate Center Area
itself. Unless specified otherwise, calls to subsequent NXXs of US LEC will be
routed in the same manner as calls to US LEC's initial NXXs.
13.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement is intended, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed, to in
any way constrain US LEC's choices regarding the size ofthe local calling
area(s) that US LEC may establish for its Customers, which local calling areas
may be larger than, smaller than, or identical to Verizon's local calling areas.
68

14. Joint Network Implementation and Grooming Process; and Installation,
Maintenance, Testing and Repair
14.1 Joint Network Im lementation and Groomin Process.
Upon request ofeither Party, the Parties shall jointly develop an implementation
and grooming process (the "Joint Grooming Process" or "Joint Process" )which
may define and detail, inter alia:
14.1. 1 standards to ensure that Interconnection Trunks experience a grade of
service, availability and quality which is comparable to that achieved
on interoffice trunks within Verizon's network and in accord with all
appropriate relevant industry-accepted quality, reliability and
availability standards. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement,
trunks provided by either Party for Interconnection services will be
engineered using a design-blocking objective ofB.01.
14.1.2 the respective duties and responsibilities ofthe Parties with respect to
the administration and maintenance ofthe trunk groups, including, but
not limited to, standards and procedures for notification and
discoveries oftrunk disconnects;
14.1.3 disaster recovery provision escalations;
14.1.4 additional technically feasible Interconnection Point(s) on Verizon's
network designated by US LEC in a LATA as provided in Section 2;
and
14.1.5 such other matters as the Parties may agree, including, e.g., End
Office to End Office high usage trunks as good engineering practices
may dictate.
14.2 Installation Maintenance Testin and Re air.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, Interconnection provided by a Party shall be equal in quality to
that provided by such Party to itself, any subsidiary, affiliates or third party. If
either Party is unable to fulfill its obligations under this Section 14.2, it shall notify
the other Party ofits inability to do so and will negotiate alternative intervals in
good faith. The Parties agree that to the extent required by Applicable Law, the
standards to be used by a Party for isolating and clearing any disconnections
and/or other outages or troubles shall be at parity with standards used by such
Party with respect to itself, any subsidiary, affiliate or third party.
14.3 Forecastin Re uirements for Trunk Provisionin
Within ninety (90)days ofexecuting this Agreement, US LEC shall provide
Verizon a two (2)year traffic forecast. This initial forecast will provide the amount
oftraffic to be delivered to and from Verizon over each ofthe Interconnection
Trunk groups over the next eight (8)quarters. The forecast shall be updated and
provided to Verizon on an as-needed basis but no less frequently than
semiannually. All forecasts shall comply with the Verizon CLEC Interconnection
Trunking Forecast Guide and shall include, at a minimum, Access Carrier
Terminal Location (ACTL), traffic type (Reciprocal Compensation Traffic/Toll
Traffic, Operator Services, 911,etc.),code (identifies trunk group), A location/Z
location (CLLI codes for applicable Verizon Tandem and End Office switches to
which US LEC wishes to send traffic and the technically feasible Interconnection
69

Points on Verizon's network in a LATA at which the Parties will interconnect,
interface type (e.g. , DS1),and trunks in service each year (cumulative).
14.3. 1 Initial Forecasts/Trunkin Re uirements. Because Verizon's trunking
requirements will, at least during an initial period, be dependent on the
Customer segments and service segments within Customer segments
to whom US LEC decides to market its services, Verizon will be largely
dependent on US LECto provide accurate trunk forecasts for both
inbound (from Verizon) and outbound (to Verizon) traffic. Verizon will,
as an initial matter, provide the same number oftrunks to terminate
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic to US LEC as US LEC provides to
terminate Reciprocal Compensation Traffic to Verizon. At Verizon's
discretion, when US LEC expressly identifies particular situations that
are expected to produce traffic that is substantially skewed in either
the inbound or outbound direction, Verizon will provide the number of
trunks US LEC suggests; provided, however, that in all cases
Verizon's provision ofthe forecasted number oftrunks to US LEC is
conditioned on the following: that such forecast is based on
reasonable engineering criteria, there are no capacity constraints, and
US LEC's previous forecasts have proven to be reliable and accurate.
14.3.1. 1 Monitorin and Ad'ustin Forecasts. Verizon will, for ninety
(90)days, monitor traffic on each trunk group that it
establishes at US LEC's suggestion or request pursuant to
the procedures identified in Section 14.3. At the end ofsuch
ninety-(90) day period, Verizon may disconnect trunks that,
based on reasonable engineering criteria and capacity
constraints, are not warranted by the actual traffic volume
experienced.
14.3.1.2 In subsequent periods, Verizon may also monitor traffic for
ninety (90)days on additional trunk groups that US LEC
suggests or requests Verizon to establish.
15. Number Portability -Section 251(B)(2)
15. 1 ~Sco e.
The Parties shall provide Number Portability (NP) in accordance with rules and
regulations as from time to time prescribed by the FCC.
',
15.2 Procedures for Providin LNP "Lon -term Number Portabilit
The Parties will follow the LNP provisioning process recommended by the North
American Numbering Council (NANC) and adopted by the FCC. In addition, the
Parties agree to follow the LNP ordering procedures established at the OBF.
The Parties shall provide LNP on a reciprocal basis.
15.2.1 A Customer ofone Party ("Party A")elects to become a Customer of
the other Party ("Party B").The Customer elects to utilize the original
telephone number(s) corresponding to the Telephone Exchange
Service(s) it previously received from Party A, in conjunction with the
Telephone Exchange Service(s) itwill now receive from Party B. After
Party Bhas received authorization from the Customer in accordance
with Applicable Law and sends an LSRto Party A, Parties A and Bwill
work together to port the Customer's telephone number(s) from Party
A's network to Party B's network.
70

When a telephone number is ported out ofParty A's networ
will remove any non-proprietary line based calling card(s) a
with the ported number(s) from its Line Information Databas
Reactivation ofthe line-based calling card in another LIDB,
is the responsibility ofParty Bor Party B's Customer.
When a Customer ofParty A ports their telephone numbers
and the Customer has previously secured a reservation of
I
numbers from Party A for possible activation at a future poi
reserved but inactive numbers may be ported along with the
numbers to be ported provided the numbers have been res
the Customer. Party 8 may request that Party A port all res
numbers assigned to the Customer or that Party A port only
numbers listed by Party B. As long as Party Bmaintains re
inactive numbers ported for the Customer, Party A shall not
those numbers. Party Bshall not reassign the reserved num
another Customer.
When a Customer of Party A ports their telephone numbers
in the process ofporting the Customer's telephone numbers
shall implement the ten-digit trigger feature where it is availa
Party A receives the porting request, the unconditional trigg
applied to the Customer's line before the due date ofthe po
activity. When the ten-digit unconditional trigger is not availa
A and Party Bmust coordinate the disconnect activity.
The Parties shall furnish each other with the Jurisdiction Inf
Parameter (JIP) in the Initial Address Message (IAM), conta
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG)-assigned NPA-NXX (6digits)
identifying the originating switch on calls originating from LNP capable
switches.
Where LNP is commercially available, the NXXs in the office shall be
defined as portable, except as noted in 14.2.7, and translations will be
changed in the Parties' switches to open those NXXs for database
queries in all applicable LNP capable offices within the LATA ofthe
given switch(es). On a prospective basis, all newly deployed switches
will be equipped with LNP capability and so noted in the LERG.
All NXXs assigned to LNP capable switches are to be designated as
portable unless a NXX(s) has otherwise been designated as non-
portable. Non-portable NXXs include NXX codes assigned to paging,
cellular and wireless services; codes assigned for internal testing and
official use and any other NXX codes required to be designated as
non-portable by the rules and regulations ofthe FCC. NXX codes
assigned to mass calling on a choked network may not be ported
using LNP technology but are portable using methods established by
the NANC and adopted by the FCC. On a prospective basis, newly
assigned codes in switches capable ofporting shall become
commercially available for porting with the effective date in the
network.
Both Parties' use ofLNP shall meet the performance criteria specified
by the FCC. Both Parties will act as the default carrier for the other
Party in the event that either Party is unable to perform the routing
necessary for LNP.

15.3 Procedures for Providin NP Throu h Full NXX Code Mi ration.
Where a Party has activated an entire NXX for a single Customer, or activated at
least eighty percent (80%)ofan NXX for a single Customer, with the remaining
numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use by that Customer or otherwise
unused, ifsuch Customer chooses to receive Telephone Exchange Service from
the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate with the second Party to have the
entire NXX reassigned in the LERG (and associated industry databases, routing
tables, etc. )to an End Office operated by the second Party. Such transfer will be
accomplished with appropriate coordination between the Parties and subject to
appropriate industry lead times for movements ofNXXs from one switch to
another. Neither Party shall charge the other in connection with this coordinated
transfer.
15.4 Procedures for Providin INP Interim Number Portabilit
The Parties shall provide Interim Number Portability (INP) in accordance with
rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the FCC and state
regulatory bodies, the Parties respective company procedures, and as set forth in
this Section 15.4. The Parties shall provide INP on a reciprocal basis.
15.4. 1 ln the event that either Party, Party B,wishes to serve a Customer
currently served at an End Office ofthe other Party, Party A, and that
End Office is not LNP-capable, Party A shall make INP available only
where LNP is not commercially available or not required by FCC
orders and regulations. INP will be provided by remote call forwarding
(RCF)and/or direct inward dialing (DID) technology, which will forward
terminating calls to Party B's End Office. Party Bshall provide Party A
with an appropriate "forward-to" number.
15.4.2 Prices for INP and formulas for sharing Terminating access revenues
associated with INP shall be provided where applicable, upon request
by either Party.
15.4.3 Either Party wishing to use DID to provide for INP must request a
dedicated trunk group from the End Office where the DID numbers are
currently served to the new serving-End Office. Ifthere are no existing
facilities between the respective End Offices, the dedicated facilities
and transport trunks will be provisioned as unbundled service through
the ASR provisioning process. The requesting party will reroute the
DID numbers to the pre-positioned trunk group using the LSR
provisioning process. DID trunk rates are contained in the Parties'
respective tariffs.
15.4.4 The Parties Agree that, per FCC 98-275, Paragraph 16,effective upon
the date LNP is available at any End Office ofone Party, Party A,
providing INP for Customers ofthe other Party, Party B,no further
orders will be accepted for new INP at that End Office. Orders for new
INP received prior to that date, and change orders for existing INP,
shall be worked by Party A. Orders for new INP received by Party A
on or after that date shall be rejected. Existing INP will be grand-
fathered, subject to Section 15.4.5, below.
1 5.4.5 In offices equipped with LNP prior to September 1,1999for former
Bell Atlantic offices and October 1,2000 for former GTE offices, the
Parties agree to work together to convert all existing INP-served
Customers to LNP by December 31,2000 in accordance with a
72

mutually agreed to conversion process and schedule. Ifmutually
agreed to by the Parties, the conversion period may be extended one
time by no more than 90days from December 31,2000.
15.4.6 Upon availability of LNP after October 1,2000 at an End Office of
either Party, both Parties agree to work together to convert the existing
INP-served Customers to LNP by no later than 90days from the date
ofLNP availability unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.
15.4.7 When Verizon offers LNP to US LEC but US LEC has not converted to
LNP at the end ofthe agreed to conversion period, then the remaining
INPs will be changed to a functionally equivalent tariff service and
billed to US LEC at the tariff rate(s) for the subject jurisdiction.
15.5 Procedures for LNP Re uest.
The Parties shall provide for the requesting ofEnd Office LNP capability on a
reciprocal basis through a written request. The Parties acknowledge that Verizon
has deployed LNP throughout its network in compliance with FCC 96-286 and
other applicable FCC rules.
15.5. 1 IfParty Bdesires to have LNP capability deployed in an End Office of
Party A, which is not currently capable, Party Bshall issue a LNP
request to Party A. Party A will respond to the Party B,within ten (10)
days ofreceipt ofthe request, with a date for which LNP will be
available in the requested End Office. Party A shall proceed to
provide for LNP in compliance with the procedures and timelines set
forth in FCC 96-286, Paragraph 80, and FCC 97-74, Paragraphs 65
through 67.
1 5.5.2 The Parties acknowledge that each can determine the LNP-capable
End Offices ofthe other through the Local Exchange Routing Guide
(LERG). In addition the Parties shall make information available upon
request showing their respective LNP-capable End Offices, as set
forth in this Section 15.5.

but not limited to, Verizon's applicable Tariffs) and the requirements ofApplicable
Law and as specified in Section 4 ofthe General Terms and Conditions, access
to Verizon's Network Elements on an unbundled basis and in combinations
(Combinations); provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Verizon shall be obligated to provide unbundled Network
Elements (UNEs) and Combinations to US LEC only to the extent required by
Applicable Law and may decline to provide UNEs or Combinations to US LEC to
the extent that provision ofsuch UNEs or Combinations is not required by
Applicable Law. The Parties agree to work cooperatively to develop an orderly
and efficient transition process for discontinuation ofprovisioning ofsuch UNE or
Combination. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties (or required by
Applicable Law), the transition period shall be at most three (3)months from the

3.14 The following ordering procedures shall apply to the xDSL Loops and Digital
Designed Loops:
3.14.1 US LEC shall place orders for xDSL Loops and Digital Designed
Loops by delivering to Verizon a valid electronic transmittal service
order or other mutually agreed upon type ofservice order. Such
service order shall be provided in accordance with industry format and

specifications or such format and specifications as may be agreed to
by the Parties.
Verizon is conducting a mechanized survey ofexisting Loop facilities,
on a Central Office by Central Office basis, to identify those Loops that
meet the applicable technical characteristics established by Verizon
for compatibility with ADSL, HDSL, IDSL, SDSLand BRI ISDN signals.
The results ofthis survey will be stored in a mechanized database and
made available to US LEC as the process is completed in each
Central Office. US LEC must utilize this mechanized loop qualification
database, where available, in advance ofsubmitting a valid electronic
transmittal service order for an ADSL, HDSL, IDSL, SDSLor BRI
ISDN Loop. Charges for mechanized loop qualification information are
set forth in the Pricing Attachment.
lfthe Loop is not listed in the mechanized database described in
Section 3.14.2, US LEC must request a manual loop qualification prior
to submitting a valid electronic service order for an ADSL, HDSL,
SDSL, IDSL, or BRI ISDN Loop. The rates for manual loop
qualification are set forth in the Pricing Attachment. In general,
Verizon will complete a manual loop qualification request within three
Business Days, although Verizon may require additional time due to
poor record conditions, spikes in demand, or other unforeseen events.
lfa query to the mechanized loop qualification database or manual
loop qualification indicates that a Loop does not qualify (e.g., because
it does not meet the applicable technical parameters set forth in the
Loop descriptions above), US LEC may request an Engineering
Query, as described in Section 3.14.6, to determine whether the result
is due to characteristics ofthe loop itself (e.g., specific number and
location ofbridged taps, the specific number ofload coils, or the gauge
ofthe cable).
If US LEC submits a service order for an ADSL, HDSL, SDSL, IDSL,
or BRI ISDN Loop that has not been prequalified, Verizon will query
the service order back to US LECfor qualification and will not accept
such service order until the Loop has been prequalified on a
mechanized or manual basis. IfUS LEC submits a service order for
an ADSL, HDSL, SDSL, IDSL, or BRI ISDN Loop that is, in fact, not
compatible with such services in its existing condition, Verizon will
respond back to US LECwith a "Nonqualified" indicator and with
information showing whether the non-qualified result is due to the
presence ofload coils, presence ofdigital loop carrier, or loop length
(including bridged tap).
Where US LEC has followed the prequalification procedure described
above and has determined that a Loop is not compatible with ADSL,
HDSL, SDSL, IDSL, or BRI ISDN service in its existing condition, it
may either request an Engineering Query to determine whether
conditioning may make the Loop compatible with the applicable
service; or ifUS LEC is already aware ofthe conditioning required
(e.g., where US LEC has previously requested a qualification and has
obtained loop characteristics), US LEC may submit a service order for
a Digital Designed Loop. Verizon will undertake to condition or extend
the Loop in accordance with this Section 3.14upon receipt ofUS
LEC's valid, accurate and pre-qualified service order for a Digital
Designed Loop.
82

3.15 The Parties will make reasonable efforts to coordinate their respective roles in
order to minimize provisioning problems. In general, where conditioning or loop
extensions are requested by US LEC, an interval ofeighteen (18)Business Days
will be required by Verizon to complete the loop analysis and the necessary
construction work involved in conditioning and/or extending the loop as follows:
3.15. 1 Three (3)Business Days will be required following receipt ofUS LEC's
valid, accurate and pre-qualified service order for a Digital Designed
Loop to analyze the loop and related plant records and to create an
Engineering Work Order.
3.15.2 Upon completion ofan Engineering Work Order, Verizon will initiate
the construction order to perform the changes/modifications to the
Loop requested by US LEC. Conditioning activities are, in most
cases, able to be accomplished within fifteen (15)Business Days.
Unforeseen conditions may add to this interval.
After the engineering and conditioning tasks have been completed, the standard
Loop provisioning and installation process will be initiated, subject to Verizon's
standard provisioning intervals.
3.16 IfUS LEC requires a change in scheduling, it must contact Verizon to issue a
supplement to the original service order. IfUS LEC cancels the request for
conditioning after a loop analysis has been completed but prior to the
commencement ofconstruction work, US LEC shall compensate Verizon for an
Engineering Work Order charge as set forth in the Pricing Attachment. IfUS
LEC cancels the request for conditioning after the loop analysis has been
completed and after construction work has started or is complete, US LEC shall
compensate Verizon for an Engineering Work Order charge as well as the
charges associated with the conditioning tasks performed as set forth in the
Pricing Attachment.
3.17 Conversion ofLive Telephone Exchange Service to Analog 2W Loops.
3.17. 1 The following coordination procedures shall apply to "live" cutovers of
Verizon Customers who are converting their Telephone Exchange
Services to US LEC Telephone Exchange Services provisioned over
Analog 2W unbundled Local Loops ("Analog 2W Loops) to be provided
by Verizon to US LEC:
3.17.1. 1 Coordinated cutover charges shall apply to conversions of
live Telephone Exchange Services to Analog 2W Loops.
When an outside dispatch is required to perform a
conversion, additional charges may apply. IfUS LEC does
not request a coordinated cutover, Verizon will process US
LEC's order as a new installation subject to applicable
standard provisioning intervals.
3.17.1.2 US LEC shall request Analog 2W Loops for coordinated
cutover from Verizon by delivering to Verizon a valid
electronic Local Service Request ("LSR").Verizon agrees to
accept from US LEC the date and time for the conversion
designated on the LSR ("Scheduled Conversion Time"),
provided that such designation is within the regularly
scheduled operating hours ofthe Verizon Regional CLEC
Control Center ("RCCC")and subject to the availability of
Verizon's work force. In the event that Verizon's work force
83

is not available, US LEC and Verizon shall mutually agree
on a New Conversion Time, as defined below. US LEC
shall designate the Scheduled Conversion Time subject to
Verizon standard provisioning intervals as stated in the
Verizon CLEC Handbook, as may be revised from time to
time. Within three (3)Business Days ofVerizon's receipt of
such valid LSR, or as otherwise required by Applicable Law,
Verizon shall provide US LECthe scheduled due date for
conversion ofthe Analog 2W Loops covered by such LSR.
US LEC shall provide dial tone at the US LEC Collocation
site at least forty-eight (48)hours prior to the Scheduled
Conversion Time.
Either Party may contact the other Party to negotiate a new
Scheduled Conversion Time (the "New Conversion Time");
provided, however, that each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide four (4)business hours'
advance notice to the other Party ofits request for a New
Conversion Time. Any Scheduled Conversion Time or New
Conversion Time may not be rescheduled more than one (1)
time in a business day, and any two New Conversion Times
for a particular Analog 2W Loop shall differ by at least eight
(8)hours, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.
Ifthe New Conversion Time is more than one (1)business
hour from the original Scheduled Conversion Time or from
the previous New Conversion Time, the Party requesting
such New Conversion Time shall be subject to the following:
3.17.1.5. 1 IfVerizon requests to reschedule outside ofthe
one (1)hour time frame above, the Analog 2W
Loops Service Order Charge for the original
Scheduled Conversion Time or the previous
New Conversion Time shall be waived upon
request from US LEC; and
3.17.1.5.2 IfUS LEC requests to reschedule outside the
one (1)hour time frame above, US LECshall be
charged an additional Analog 2W Loops Service
Order Charge for rescheduling the conversion to
the New Conversion Time.
IfUS LEC is not ready to accept service at the Scheduled
Conversion Time or at a New Conversion Time, as
applicable, an additional Service Order Charge shall apply.
IfVerizon is not available or ready to perform the conversion
within thirty (30)minutes ofthe Scheduled Conversion Time
or New Conversion Time, as applicable, Verizon and US
LECwill reschedule and, upon request from US LEC,
Verizon will waive the Analog 2W Loop Service Order
Charge for the original Scheduled Conversion Time.
The standard time interval expected from disconnection ofa
live Telephone Exchange Service to the connection ofthe
Analog 2W Loops to US LEC is fifteen (15)minutes per
Analog 2W Loop for all orders consisting oftwenty (20)
84

Analog 2W Loops or less. Orders involving more than
twenty (20) Loops will require a negotiated interval.
3.17.1.8 Conversions involving LNP will be completed according to
North American Numbering Council ("NANC") standards, via
the regional Number Portability Administration Center
("NPAC").
3.17.1.9 IfUS LEC requires Analog 2W Loop conversions outside of
the regularly scheduled Verizon RCCC operating hours,
such conversions shall be separately negotiated. Additional
charges (e.g. overtime labor charges) may apply for desired
dates and times outside ofregularly scheduled RCCC
operating hours.
3.18 Verizon shall provide US LEC access to its Loops at each ofVerizon's Wire
Centers for Loops terminating in that Wire Center. In addition, ifUS LEC orders
one or more Loops provisioned via Integrated Digital oop Carrier or Remote
I
Switching technology deployed as a Loop concentrator, Verizon shall, where
available, move the requested Loop(s) to a spare physical Loop, ifone is existing
and available, at no additional charge to US LEC. If, however, no spare physical
Loop is available, Verizon shall within three (3)Business Days ofUS LEC's
request notify US LEC ofthe lack ofavailable facilities. US LEC may then at its
discretion make a Network Element Bona Fide Request pursuant to Section 14.3
to Verizon to provide the unbundled Local Loop through the demultiplexing ofthe
integrated digitized Loop(s). US LEC may also make a Network Element Bona
Fide Request pursuant to Section 14.3for access to Unbundled Local Loops at
the Loop concentration site point. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, standard provisioning intervals shall not apply to Loops provided
under this Section 3.18.
Line Sharing
4. 1 "Line Sharing" is an arrangement by which Verizon facilitates US LEC's provision
ofADSL (in accordance with T1.413),Splitterless ADSL (in accordance with
T1.419),RADSL (in accordance with TR059), Multiple Virtual Line (MVL) (a
proprietary technology), or any other xDSLtechnology that is presumed to be
acceptable for shared line deployment in accordance with FCC rules, to a
particular Customer location over an existing copper Loop that is being used
simultaneously by Verizon to provide analog circuit-switched voice grade service
to that Customer by making available to US LEC, solely for US LEC's own use,
the frequency range above the voice band on the same copper Loop required by
US LEC to provide such services. This Section 4 addresses line sharing over
loops that are entirely copper loops.
4.2 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1,Verizon shall provide Line
Sharing to US LECfor US LEC's provision ofADSL (in accordance with T1.413),
Splitterless ADSL (in accordance with T1.419),RADSL (in accordance with TR0
59), MVL (a proprietary technology), or any other xDSL technology that is
presumed to be acceptable for shared line deployment in accordance with FCC
rules, in accordance with this Section 4and the rates and charges provided in
the Pricing Attachment. Verizon shall provide Line Sharing to US LEC in
accordance with, but only to the extent required by, Applicable Law. In order for
a Loop to be eligible for Line Sharing, the following conditions must be satisfied
for the duration ofthe Line Sharing arrangement: (i)the Loop must consist ofa
copper loop compatible with an xDSL service that is presumed to be acceptable
for shared-line deployment in accordance with FCC rules; (ii)Verizon must be
85

providing simultaneous circuit-switched analog voice grade service to the
Customer served by the Loop in question; (iii)the Verizon Customer's dial tone
must originate from a Verizon End Office Switch in the Wire Center where the
Line Sharing arrangement is being requested; and (iv) the xDSLtechnology to be
deployed by US LEC on that Loop must not significantly degrade the
performance ofother services provided on that Loop.
4.3 Verizon shall make Line Sharing available to US LEC at the rates and charges
set forth in the Pricing Attachment. In addition to the recurring and nonrecurring
charges shown in the Pricing Attachment for Line Sharing itself, the following
rates shown in the Pricing Attachment and in Verizon's applicable Tariffs are
among those that may apply to a Line Sharing arrangement: (i)prequalification
charges to determine whether a Loop is xDSL compatible (i.e. compatible with
,
an xDSL service that is presumed to be acceptable for shared-line deployment in
accordance with FCC rules); (ii) engineering query charges, engineering work
order charges, or Loop conditioning (Digital Designed Loop) charges; {iii)
charges associated with Collocation activities requested by US LEC; and (iv)
misdirected dispatch charges, charges for installation or repair, manual
intervention surcharges, trouble isolation charges, and pair swap/line and station
transfer charges.
4.4 The following ordering procedures shall apply to Line Sharing:
4.4. 1 To determine whether a Loop qualifies for Line Sharing, the Loop must
first be prequalified to determine ifit is xDSL compatible. US LEC
must utilize the Loop qualification processes described in the terms
applicable to xDSL and Digital Designed Loops to make this
determination.
4.4.2 US LEC shall place orders for Line Sharing by delivering to Verizon a
valid electronic transmittal service order or other mutually agreed upon
type ofservice order. Such service order shall be provided in
accordance with industry format and specifications or such format and
specifications as may be agreed to by the Parties.
4.4.3 Ifthe Loop is prequalified by US LECthrough the Loop prequalification
database, and ifa positive response is received and followed by
receipt of US LEC's valid, accurate and pre-qualified service order for
Line Sharing, Verizon will return an LSRconfirmation within twenty-
four {24)hours (weekends and holidays excluded) for LSRswith less
than six (6)loops and within 72 hours {weekends and holidays
excluded) for LSRs with six (6)or more loops.
4.4.4 Ifthe Loop requires qualification manually or through an Engineering
Query, three (3)additional Business Days will generally be required to
obtain Loop qualification results before an order confirmation can be
returned following receipt of US LEC's valid, accurate request.
Verizon may require additional time to complete the Engineering
Query where there are poor record conditions, spikes in demand, or
other unforeseen events.
4.4.5 Ifconditioning is required to make a Loop capable ofsupporting Line
Sharing and US LEC orders such conditioning, then Verizon shall
provide such conditioning in accordance with the terms ofthis
Agreement pertaining to Digital Designed Loops; or ifthis Agreement
does not contain provisions pertaining to Digital Designed Loops, then
in accordance with Verizon's generally available rates, terms and
86

conditions applicable to Digital Design Loops; provided, however, that
Verizon shall not be obligated to provide Loop conditioning ifVerizon
establishes, in the manner required by Applicable Law, that such
conditioning is likely to degrade significantly the voice-grade service
being provided to Verizon's Customers over such Loops.
4.4.6 The standard Loop provisioning and installation process will be
initiated for the Line Sharing arrangement only once the requested
engineering and conditioning tasks have been completed on the Loop.
Scheduling changes and charges associated with order cancellations
after conditioning work has been initiated are addressed in the terms
pertaining to Digital Designed Loops, as referenced in Section 4.4.5,
above. The standard provisioning interval for the Line Sharing
arrangement shall be as set out in the Verizon Product Interval Guide;
provided that the standard provisioning interval for the Line Sharing
arrangement shall not exceed the shortest ofthe following intervals:
(a)six (6)business days; (b) the standard provisioning interval for the
Line Sharing arrangement that is stated in an applicable Verizon Tariff;
or, (c)the standard provisioning interval for the Line Sharing
arrangement that is required by Applicable Law. The standard
provisioning interval for the Line Sharing arrangement shall commence
only once any requested engineering and conditioning tasks have
been completed. Line Sharing arrangements that require pair swaps
or line and station transfers in order to free-up facilities may have a
provisioning interval that is longer than the standard provisioning
interval for the Line Sharing arrangement. In no event shall the Line
Sharing interval offered to US LEC be longer than the interval offered
to any similarly situated Affiliate ofVerizon.
4.4.7 US LEC must provide all required Collocation, CFA, Special Bill
Number (SBN)and NC/NCI information when a Line Sharing
Arrangement is ordered. Collocation augments required, either at the
Point ofTermination (POT) Bay, Collocation node, or for splitter
placement, must be ordered using standard collocation applications
and procedures, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties or specified
in this Agreement.
4.4.8 The Parties recognize that Line Sharing is an offering that requires
both Parties to make reasonable efforts to coordinate their respective
roles in order to minimize provisioning problems and facility issues.
US LEC will provide reasonable, timely, and accurate forecasts ofits
Line Sharing requirements, including splitter placement elections and
ordering preferences. These forecasts are in addition to projections
provided for other stand-alone unbundled Loop types.
4.5 To the extent required by Applicable Law, US LEC shall provide Verizon with
information regarding the type ofxDSL technology that it deploys on each shared
Loop. Where any proposed change in technology is planned on a shared Loop,
US LEC must provide this information to Verizon in order for Verizon to update
Loop records and anticipate effects that the change may have on the voice grade
service and other Loops in the same or adjacent binder groups.
4.6 As described more fully in Verizon Technical Reference 72575, the xDSL
technology used by US LECfor Line Share Arrangements shall operate within
the Power Spectral Density (PSD) limits set forth in T1.413-1998(ADSL),
T1.419-2000(Splitterless ADSL), orTR59-1999(RADSL), and MVL (a
proprietary technology) shall operate within the 0to 4 kHz PSD limits ofT1.413-
87

1998and within the transmit PSD limits ofT1.601-1998for frequencies above 4
kHz, provided that the MVL PSD associated with audible frequencies above 4
kHz shall be sufficiently attenuated to preclude significantly degrading voice
services. US LEC*sdeployment ofadditional Advanced Services shall be subject
to the applicable FCC Rules.
4.7 US LEC may only access the high frequency portion ofa Loop in a Line Sharing
arrangement through an established Collocation arrangement at the Verizon
Serving Wire Center that contains the End Office Switch through which voice
grade service is provided to Verizon's Customer. US LEC is responsible for
providing, through one ofthe splitter options described below, a splitter at that
Wire Center that complies with ANSI specification T1.413,employs Direct
Current (DC) blocking capacitors or equivalent technology to assist in isolating
high bandwidth trouble resolution and maintenance to the high frequency portion
ofthe frequency spectrum, and operates so that the analog voice "dial tone"
stays active when the splitter card is removed for testing or maintenance. US
LEC is also responsible for providing its own Digital Subscriber Line Access
Multiplexer (DSLAM) equipment in the Collocation arrangement and any
necessary Customer Provided Equipment (CPE)for the xDSL service it intends
to provide (including CPE splitters, filters and/or other equipment necessary for
the end user to receive separate voice and data services across the shared
Loop).
Two splitter configurations are available. In both configurations, the splitter must
be provided by US LEC and must satisfy the same NEBS requirements that
Verizon imposes on its own splitter equipment or the splitter equipment ofany
Verizon Affiliate. US LEC must designate which splitter option it is choosing on
the Collocation application or augment. Regardless ofthe option selected, the
splitter arrangements must be installed before US LEC submits an order for Line
Sharing.
Splitter Option A (Splitter Option 1):Splitter in US LEC Collocation Area
In this configuration, the US LEC-provided splitter (ANSI T1.413or MVL
compliant) is provided, installed and maintained by US LEC in its own Collocation
space within the Customer's serving End Office. The Verizon-provided dial tone
is routed through the splitter in the US LEC Collocation area. Any
rearrangements will be the responsibility of US LEC.
Splitter Option C (Splitter Option 2):Splitter in Verizon Area
In this configuration, Verizon inventories and maintains a US LEC-provided
splitter (ANSI T1.413or MVL compliant) in Verizon space within the Customer' s
serving End Office. The splitters will be installed shelf-at-a-time.
In those serving End Offices where Verizon employs the use ofa POT Bay for
interconnection of US LEC's Collocation arrangement with Verizon's network, the
splitter will be installed (mounted) in a relay rack between the POT Bay and the
MDF. The demarcation point is at the splitter end ofthe cable connecting the
POT Bay and the splitter. Installation ofthe splitter will be performed by Verizon
or, at US LEC's election, by a Verizon-approved vendor designated by US LEC.
In those serving End Offices where Verizon does not employ a POT Bay for
interconnection of US LEC's Collocation arrangement with Verizon's network, the
US LEC provided splitter will be installed (mounted) in a relay rack between the
88

7
f

US LEC Collocation arrangement and the MDF. The demarcation point is at the
splitter end ofthe cable connecting the US LEC Collocation arrangement and the
splitter. Installation ofthe splitter will be performed by Verizon, or, at US LEC's
election, by a Verizon-approved vendor designated by US LEC.
In either scenario, Verizon will control the splitter and will direct any required
activity. Where a POT Bay is employed, Verizon will also perform all POT Bay
work required in this configuration. Verizon will provide a splitter inventory to US
LEC upon completion ofthe required work.
4.7. 1 Where a new splitter is to be installed as part ofan initial Collocation
implementation, the splitter installation may be ordered as part ofthe
initial Collocation application. Associated Collocation charges
(application and engineering fees) apply. US LEC must submit a new
Collocation application, with the application fee, to Verizon detailing its
request. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, standard
Collocation intervals will apply.
4.7.2 Where a new splitter is to be installed as part ofan existing Collocation
arrangement, or where the existing Collocation arrangement is to be
augmented (e.g.,with additional terminations at the POT Bay or US
LEC's collocation arrangement to support Line Sharing), the splitter
installation or augment may be ordered via an application for
Collocation augment. Associated Collocation charges (application and
engineering fees) apply. US LEC must submit the application for
Collocation augment, with the application fee, to Verizon. Unless a
longer interval is stated in Verizon's applicable Tariff, an interval of
seventy-six (76)business days shall apply.
4.8 US LECwill have the following options for testing shared Loops:
4.8. 1 In serving End Offices where Verizon employs a POT Bayfor
interconnection of US LEC Collocation arrangement with Verizon's
network, the following options shall be available to US LEC.
4.8.1. 1 Under Splitter Option A, US LEC may conduct its own
physical tests ofthe shared Loop from US LEC's collocation
area. Ifit chooses to do so, US LEC may supply and install
a test head to facilitate such physical tests, provided that:
(a)the test head satisfies the same NEBS requirements that
Verizon imposes on its own test head equipment or the test
head equipment ofany Verizon Affiliate; and (b)the test
head does not interrupt the voice circuit to any greater
degree than a conventional MLT test. Specifically, the US
LEC-provided test equipment may not interrupt an in-in-
progress voice connection and must automatically restore
any circuits tested in intervals comparable to MLT. This
optional US LEC-provided test head will be installed in US
LEC's Collocaton area between the "line" port ofthe splitter
and the POT Bay in order to conduct remote physical tests
ofthe shared Loop.
4.8.1.2 Under Splitter Option C, upon request by US LEC, either
Verizon or, at US LEC's election, a Verizon-approved
vendor selected by US LECwill install a US LEC-provided
test head to enable US LEC to conduct remote physical
89

'k
~
4

tests ofthe shared Loop. This optional US LEC-provided
test head will be installed at a point between the "line" port
ofthe splitter and the Verizon-provided test head that is
used by Verizon to conduct its own Loop testing. The US
LEC-provided test head must satisfy the same NEBS
requirements that Verizon imposes on its own test head
equipment or the test head equipment ofany Verizon
Affiliate, and may not interrupt the voice circuit to any
greater degree than a conventional MLT test. Specifically,
the US LEC-provided test equipment may not interrupt an
in-progress voice connection and must automatically restore
any circuits tested in intervals comparable to MLT. Verizon
will inventory, control and maintain the US LEC-provided
test head, and will direct all required activity.
4.8.1.3 Under either Splitter Option, ifVerizon has installed its own
test head, Verizon will conduct tests ofthe shared Loop
using a Verizon-provided test head, and, upon request, will
provide these test results to US LEC during normal trouble
isolation procedures in accordance with reasonable
procedures.
4.8.1.4 Under either Splitter Option, upon request by US LEC,
Verizon will make MLT access available to US LECvia
RETAS after the service order has been completed. US
LEC will utilize the circuit number to initiate a test.
In those serving End Offices where Verizon has not employed a POT
Bay for interconnection of US LEC's Collocation arrangement with
Verizon's network, US LECwill not be permitted to supply its own test
head. Instead, Verizon will make a testing system available to US
LECthrough use ofthe on-line computer interface test system at
www. verizon. com/wise.
The Parties will continue to work cooperatively on testing procedures.
To this end, in situations where US LEC has attempted to use one or
more ofthe foregoing testing options but is still unable to resolve the
error or trouble on the shared Loop, Verizon and US LECwill each
dispatch a technician to an agreed-upon point to conduct ajoint meet
test to identify and resolve the error or trouble. Verizon may assess a
charge for a misdirected dispatch only ifthe error or trouble is
determined to be one that US LEC should reasonably have been able
to isolate and diagnose through one ofthe testing options available to
US LEC above. The Parties will mutually agree upon the specific
procedures for conducting joint meet tests.
Verizon and US LEC each have a responsibility to educate the
Customer regarding which service provider should be called for
problems with their respective service offerings. Verizon will retain
primary responsibility for voice band trouble tickets, including repairing
analog voice grade services and the physical line between the NID at
the Customer premise and the point ofdemarcation in the Central
Office. US LECwill be responsible for repairing services it offers over
the Line Sharing arrangement. Each Party will be responsible for
maintaining its own equipment. Ifa splitter or test head that US LEC
has provided to Verizon malfunctions, US LEC shall provide a
replacement splitter or test head to Verizon. Before either Party
90

initiates any activity on a shared Loop that may cause a disruption of
the service ofthe other Party, that Party shall first make a good faith
effort to notify the other Party ofthe possibility ofa service disruption.
Verizon and US LECwill work together to address Customer initiated
repair requests and to prevent adverse impacts to the Customer.
4,8.5 When Verizon provides Inside Wire maintenance services to the
Customer, Verizon will only be responsible for testing and repairing the
Inside Wire for voice-grade services. Verizon will not test, dispatch a
technician, repair, or upgrade Inside Wire to clear trouble calls
associated with US LEC's Advanced Services. Verizon will not repair
any CPE provided by US LEC. Before a trouble ticket is issued to
Verizon, US LEC shall validate whether the Customer is experiencing
a trouble that arises from US LEC's service. Ifthe problem reported is
isolated to the analog voice-grade service provided by Verizon, a
trouble ticket may be issued to Verizon.
4.8.6 In the case ofa trouble reported by the Customer on its voice-grade
service, ifVerizon determines the reported trouble arises from US
LEC's equipment, splitter problems, or US LEC's activities, Verizon
will:
4.8.6. 1 Notify US LEC and request that US LEC immediately test
the trouble on US LEC's service.
4.8.6.2 Ifthe Customer's voice grade service is so degraded that
the Customer cannot originate or receive voice grade calls,
and US LEC has not cleared its trouble within a reasonable
time frame, Verizon may take unilateral steps to temporarily
restore the Customer's voice grade service ifVerizon
determines in good faith that the cause ofthe voice
interruption is US LEC's service.
4.8.6.3 Upon completion ofthe steps in 4.8.6. 1 and 4.8.6.2, above,
Verizon may temporarily remove the US LEC-provided
splitter from the Customer's Loop and switch port ifVerizon
determines in good faith that the cause ofthe voice
interruption is US LEC's service.
4.8.64 Upon notification from US LECthat the malfunction in US
LEC's service has been cleared, Verizon will restore US
LEC's service by restoring the splitter on the Customer' s
Loop.
4.8.6.5 Upon completion ofthe above steps, US LECwill be
charged a Trouble Isolation Charge (TIC)to recover
Verizon's costs ofisolating and temporarily removing the
malfunctioning US LEC service from the Customer's line if
the cause ofthe voice interruption was US LEC's service.
4.8.6,6 Verizon shall not be liable to US LEC, the Customer, or any
other person, for damages ofany kind for disruptions to US
LEC's service that are the result ofthe above steps taken in
good faith to restore the end user's voice-grade POTS
service, and US LEC shall indemnify Verizon from any
Claims that result from such steps.

5. Line Splitting
CLECs may provide integrated voice and data services over the same Loop by engaging
in "line splitting" as set forth in paragraph 18ofthe FCC's Line Sharing Reconsideration
Order (CC Docket Nos. 98-147,96-98),released January 19,2001. Any line splitting
between two CLECs shall be accomplished by prior negotiated arrangement between
those CLECs. To achieve a line splitting capability, CLECs may utilize existing
supporting OSSto order and combine in a line splitting configuration an unbundled xDSL
capable Loop terminated to a collocated splitter and DSLAM equipment provided by a
participating CLEC, unbundled switching combined with shared transport, collocator-to-
collocator connections, and available cross-connects, under the terms and conditions set
forth in their Interconnection Agreement(s). The participating CLECs shall provide any
splitters used in a line splitting configuration. CLECs seeking to migrate existing UNE
platform configurations to a line splitting configuration using the same unbundled
elements utilized in the pre-existing platform arrangement may do so consistent with such
implementation schedules, terms, conditions and guidelines as are agreed upon for such
migrations in the ongoing DSL Collaborative in the State ofNew York, NY PSC Case 00-
C-0127, allowing for local jurisdictional and OSS differences.
Sub-Loop

After Verizon has completed the installation ofthe interconnecting
cable to a US LECTOPIC and US LEC has paid the full cost ofsuch
installation, US LEC can request the connection ofVerizon Sub-Loop
Distribution Facilities to the US LEC TOPIC. At the same time, US
LEC shall advise Verizon ofthe services that US LEC plans to provide
over the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility, request any conditioning ofthe
Sub-Loop Distribution Facility and assign the pairs in the
interconnecting cable. US LEC shall run any crosswires within the
TOPIC.
IfUS LEC requests that Verizon reactivate an unused drop and NID,
then US LEC shall provide dial tone (or its DSLequivalent) on the US
LEC side ofthe applicable Verizon FDI at least twenty-four (24) hours
before the due date. On the due date, a Verizon technician will run the
appropriate cross connection to connect the Verizon Sub-Loop
Distribution Facility to the US LEC dial tone or equivalent from the
TOPIC. IfUS LEC requests that Verizon provide US LECwith access
to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility that, at the time of US LEC's
request, Verizon is using to provide service to a Customer, then, after
US LEC has looped two interconnecting pairs through the TOPIC and
at least twenty four (24) hours before the due date, a Verizon
technician shall crosswire the dial tone from the Verizon central office
through the Verizon side ofthe TOPIC and back out again to the
Verizon FDI and Verizon Sub-Loop Distribution Facility using the "loop
through" approach. On the due date, US LEC shall disconnect
Verizon's dial tone, crosswire its diai tone to the Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility and submit US LEC's long-term number portability request.
Verizon will not provide access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility if
Verizon is using the loop ofwhich the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility is
a part to provide line sharing service to another CLEC or a service that
uses derived channel technology to a Customer unless such other
CLEC first terminates the Verizon-provided line sharing or such
Customer first disconnects the service that utilizes derived channel
technology.
Verizon shall provide US LECwith access to a Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility in accordance with negotiated intervals
Verizon shall repair and maintain a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility at
the request of US LEC and subject to the time and material rates set
forth in Pricing Attachment and the rates, terms and conditions of
Verizon's applicable Tariffs. US LEC accepts responsibility for initial
