REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission

Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Low Latency Communications LLC; Application
of Low Latency Communications LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 20-
Dear Secretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, Low Latency Communications LLC ("Low
Latency") hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
Low Latency respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").1 Low
Latency is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily be released to
the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, Low Latency would
suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
u.s.c.
5 § 552(b)(4).

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules4 , Low
Latency hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.5
Low Latency seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
Low Latency is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier partner, as proof
of Low Latency's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 1S(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's
rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which Low Latency seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors"8 . Exhibit A
describes the agreement between Low Latency and its carrier partner and contains proprietary
commercial information concerning Low Latency's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Low Latency's disadvantage. Low Latency has numerous competitors in the Voice over
Internet Protocol ("VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and
commercial information of the type provided by Low Latency could compromise Low Latency's
position in this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial
competitive harm to Low Latency.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use Low Latency's proprietary commercial and operational information to
Low Latency's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how Low
Latency provides services as well as about Low Latency's commercial agreements with others in
the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Low Latency has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.'l
Low Latency has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
Low Latency requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
10 47 C.P.R. § 0.459(b)(S).
11 47 C.P.R.§ 0.459(b)(6).

9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT LOW LATENCY BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER
ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns Low Latency's proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
