RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of LP Telecom, LLC d/b/a Landing Point Telecom;
Application of LP Telecom, LLC d/b/a Landing Point Telecom for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No.
20-
Dear Secretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, LP Telecom, LLC d/b/a Landing Point
Telecom ("Landing Point") hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering
resources.
Landing Point respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade
secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA").1 Landing Point is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily
be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, Landing
Point would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
1 5 u.s.c. § 552(b)(4).

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules4 , Landing
Point hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.5
Landing Point seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
Landing Point is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier partner, as
proof of Landing Point's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 1S(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED/
The information for which Landing Point seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors"8 • Exhibit A
describes the agreement between Landing Point and its carrier partner and contains proprietary
commercial information concerning Landing Point's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Landing Point's disadvantage. Landing Point has numerous competitors in the Voice over
Internet Protocol ("VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and
commercial information of the type provided by Landing Point could compromise Landing
Point's position in this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial
competitive harm to Landing Point.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use Landing Point's proprietary commercial and operational information to
Landing Point's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how Landing
Point provides services as well as about Landing Point's commercial agreements with others in
the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Landing Point has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.'Z
Landing Point has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
Landing Point requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
10 47 C.P.R. § 0.459(b)(S).
11 47 C.P.R. § 0.459(b)(6).
12 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7).

9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT LANDING POINT BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns Landing Point's proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
