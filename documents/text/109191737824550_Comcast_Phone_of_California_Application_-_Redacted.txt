Re: REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF INFORMATION – Application of
Comcast Phone of California, LLC for Numbering Resources Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Comcast Phone of California, LLC (“Comcast”) hereby submits the attached Application of
Comcast Phone of California, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”).
The redacted version of the Application is being filed via the Electronic Comment Filing System
(“ECFS”), and the confidential version is being submitted pursuant to the applicable procedures
established by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”). Pursuant to
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) and the FCC’s rules,1 Comcast requests
confidential treatment for Attachments A, B, and D (“Attachments”), which are being submitted with the
confidential version of the Application. The Attachments, which contain commercially sensitive
information, relate to Comcast’s provision of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”)
services and includes company-specific, confidential commercial information, including information that
is protected from disclosure by FOIA Exemption 42 and the Commission’s rules protecting information
that is not routinely available for public inspection and that would customarily be guarded from
competitors.3
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457(d), 0.459; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1905 (prohibiting disclosure “to any extent not
authorized by law” of “information [that] concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or
apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any
person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association”).
2 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
3 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457(d), 0.459.

1. Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment is sought. Comcast
requests that the Attachments be treated as confidential pursuant to Exemption 4 of FOIA and Sections
0.457(d) and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, which protect confidential commercial and other
information not routinely available for public inspection. The Attachments concern the company’s
provision of VoIP and include both information about Comcast’s operations and the costs of providing
the service. Specifically, evidence in support of Comcast’s 911 certification is contained in Attachments A
and B, and Attachment D contains an agreement between Comcast and its carrier partner providing that
the carrier partner will provide Time Division Multiplexing connectivity to the Public Switched Telephone
Network. All of this information is company-specific, competitively sensitive, business confidential
and/or proprietary commercial and financial information concerning Comcast’s operations that would not
routinely be made available to the public.
2. Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information was submitted or a description of the
circumstance giving rise to the submission. Comcast is submitting the Attachments in conjunction with the
Application pursuant to the Commission’s rules.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or contains a trade secret or
is privileged. The Attachments contain company-specific, competitively sensitive, confidential and/or
proprietary, commercial and financial information.4 This information can be used to determine
information about Comcast’s operations and finances that is sensitive for competitive and other reasons.
This information would not customarily be made available to the public and would be guarded from all.
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that is subject to competition. The
confidential information at issue relates to the provision of VoIP, which is subject to vigorous
competition from other VoIP providers. If the information is not protected, Comcast’s competitors will
be able to use it to their competitive advantage.
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial competitive harm. Since this
type of information generally would not be subject to public inspection and would customarily be guarded
from competitors, the Commission’s rules recognize that release of the information is likely to produce
competitive harm.
4 The Commission has broadly defined commercial information, stating that “‘[c]ommercial’ is broader than
information regarding basic commercial operations, such as sales and profits; it includes information about work performed for
the purpose of conducting a business’s commercial operations.” Southern Company Request for Waiver of Section 90.629 of the
Commission’s Rules, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 1851, 1860 (1998) (citing Public Citizen Health Research Group
v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).

6.-7. Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent unauthorized disclosure, and
identification of whether the information is available to the public and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information
to third parties. The confidential information in the Attachments is not available to the public and has not
otherwise been disclosed previously to the public. Comcast takes precautions to ensure that this type of
information is not released to the general public or obtained by its competitors and potential competitors
through other means.
8. Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that the material should not be
available for public disclosure. Comcast requests that the Attachments be treated as confidential indefinitely,
as it is not possible to determine at this time any date certain by which the information could be disclosed
without risk of harm.
9. Any other information that the party seeking confidential treatment believes may be useful in assessing
whether its request for confidentiality should be granted. Under applicable Commission and federal court
precedent, the information provided by Comcast on a confidential basis should be shielded from public
disclosure. Exemption 4 of FOIA shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature;
(2) obtained from a person outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and
financial information in question clearly satisfies this test.
Additionally, where disclosure is likely to impair the government’s ability to obtain necessary
information in the future, it is appropriate to grant confidential treatment to that information.5 Failure to
accord confidential treatment to this information is likely to dissuade providers from voluntarily
submitting such information in the future, thus depriving the FCC of information necessary to evaluate
facts and market conditions relevant to applications and policy issues under its jurisdiction.
If a request for disclosure occurs, please provide sufficient advance notice to the undersigned prior
to any such disclosure to allow Comcast to pursue appropriate remedies to preserve the confidentiality of
the information.
5 See Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S Dep’t of Just., 728 F. Supp. 3d 113, 125 (D.D.C. 2024) (citing Ctr. for
Investigative Reporting v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., 436 F. Supp. 3d 90, 113 (D.D.C. 2019)) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 878 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc) (recognizing the importance of protecting
information that “for whatever reason, ‘would customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was
obtained’”) (citation omitted).

Guidance for Law Enforcement
Comcast is often asked to assist state and federal law enforcement agencies and government entities in their criminal or administrative
investigations, and we do so while protecting subscriber privacy as required by law and our subscriber privacy policies. In order to obtain
Comcast subscriber information, law enforcement agencies and government entities must provide Comcast with a valid legal request
appropriate for the matter or responsive information will not be released.
Comcast reviews and evaluates each request on a case-by-case basis and considers any special procedural or legal requirements or
applicable laws while protecting and maintaining the privacy of our subscribers, business information, and records. Unless a lawful request
or court order explicitly directs Comcast not to do so, Comcast may provide information to a subscriber regarding government requests for
information about that customer in advance or if the customer makes a verified written request to Comcast seeking information about
government requests for the subscriber’s data or records. Your request must include a non-disclosure statement directing Comcast not
to disclose the request’s existence to the customer to prevent potential notification to a customer about the existence of a government
request or court order.
Law Comcast’s Law Enforcement and Subscriber Record Center (“LESRC”) responds to valid legal
Enforcement requests from state and federal government entities and law enforcement agencies for information
and Subscriber and records relating to Comcast residential and commercial subscribers.

Where there is an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury, Comcast will expedite
release of subscriber information without legal process. Proper legal process must be submitted within a
reasonable time after the emergency has subsided. Contact the LESRC’s emergency number (877-
249-7306) to initiate release of records and provide the relevant facts and circumstances of the
emergency.
*Include a cover letter/page with your contact information and any relevant information. No cover letter is required for requests made
through the online portal or emergency disclosure requests.
Court Orders. A court order must be signed by a judge, indicating that the law enforcement officer or

Request provide any content (text messages or email), cell site location information (“CSLI”) or details on the
selection of video programming to law enforcement in response to a court order. Certain content
requires a warrant as does CSLI. A wiretap, pen register, or trap and trace all require a court order.
Subpoena. A government entity or law enforcement official may issue a subpoena to seek evidence
relevant to the investigation of a possible crime. This can include a state or federal Grand Jury, trial, or
statutorily authorized administrative subpoena. 18 U.S.C. 2703(c)(2)(A)-(F) limits the types of
information that can be released in response to a subpoena:
 Customer name and address, including email addresses
 Call detail and record of internet usage (session times and duration; bandwidth usage)

Request stored content as well as more basic subscriber or transactional information. Stored content
refers to communications or data that subscribers create and store through their Comcast services
such as email, photographs, and home security video. Certain state laws may also impose warrant
requirements on or limit disclosure of certain subscriber data or records.
Consent from Subscriber. Law enforcement may obtain subscriber records upon showing that
lawful consent was obtained from the subscriber.
Child Exploitation. Lawful demands for subscriber information that relates to the exploitation of
children are prioritized. To provide a faster response, the demand must state that the matter
involves or potentially involves the exploitation of children. Comcast will make information
available to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as required by 18 U.S.C.
2258A.
FISA. 50 U.S.C. 1801-1862 and U.S.C. 2511 submissions to Comcast should be coordinated with
the applicable FBI field office. A Special Agent or other authorized FBI employee must hand
deliver the request to Comcast.
Pen Register/Trap and Trace Device. 18 U.S.C. 3123 provides a mechanism for authorizing and
approving the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device pursuant to court
order. All orders must be coordinated with the LESRC for implementation.
National Security Letters. Delivery of all National Security Letters should be coordinated through
the FBI field office in Washington D.C. and delivered to Comcast.
Wiretaps and Interception of Communications. 18 U.S.C. 2511 provides a mechanism for
authorizing and approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication pursuant to
court order. All such orders must be coordinated with the LESRC prior to submission to Comcast.
Note: Comcast, as a cable operator, is prohibited by 47 U.S.C. 551(c)(2)(D) from providing
any information or records to state and federal law enforcement agencies and government
entities revealing cable subscriber selection of video programming in response to a
warrant, court order, or subpoena under the provisions above, and can only provide such
in response to a specific court order that complies with 47 U.S.C. 551(h) unless the
subscriber has consented. Please contact us for details.
Civil Matters. Submissions of legal requests for civil matters must be served through
Comcast’s registered agent, CSC Global, in the relevant state. Attorney-signed subpoenas are
insufficient when seeking any subscriber information or records; Comcast must receive a judge-
signed court order providing for notice to the subscriber and an opportunity to challenge any
disclosure before releasing subscriber information in a civil matter. All records in such
instances are deemed confidential and limited to use in litigations. For CSC Global,

Telephone Numbers
What
We Can Comcast can provide certain account information when provided with a landline, VoIP, or mobile
telephone number it currently or has historically served or included as a subscriber contact number.
Provide
Xfinity Mobile
Confirm with Neustar (https://www.neustar.biz/) that the mobile telephone number is assigned
to Xfinity Mobile – results will show as “CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DBA –
VERIZONWIRELESS – PA.” Verizon does not maintain Xfinity Mobile subscriber
information.
Comcast can provide a Xfinity Mobile customer’s billing information such as name, address, and
the device used, plus call detail records and text message details (date, time, and recipient
telephone numbers) and means and method of payment. Text message content (if available)
must be sought from Verizon. Verizon maintains responsibility for CALEA surveillance, pen
register/trap and trace, SMS content, video, images, CSLI, and geolocation services for Xfinity
Mobile customers.
Xfinity Voice
When provided with a Xfinity Voice (VoIP) telephone number, Comcast can provide subscriber
and billing information, call detail records, and support CALEA surveillance, pen register, and trap
and trace requests.
Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses
Please confirm that the IP address is assigned to Comcast by running a query at
http:www.ip2location.com/free.asp. Comcast’s residential subscribers are not assigned a constant
or static IP address, but rather are assigned a dynamic IP address. It is therefore necessary that all
requests for subscriber information based on an IP address include the specific date, time, and time
zone for with information is sought. IP address logs are retained for 180 days. Comcast uses
Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (“CGN”) for IPv4 Wi-Fi addresses, so any request
for subscriber data associated with a Xfinity Wi-Fi IP Addresses must also include the source
port number of the IP address for full identification capability.
Email Addresses
Residential Accounts
Residential email address accounts issued through Xfinity Internet end in
comcast.net (i.e., JohnDoe@comcast.net). If an email account ends in any other domain (e.g.,
@gmail.com or @yahoo.com), Comcast will not have information regarding the email address.
Xfinity Internet customers are provided with or can create their own email address, which
Comcast will maintain even after Xfinity Internet service is cancelled or terminated. Email
content can only be provided in response to a valid state or federal warrant.
Commercial Accounts
Requests for Comcast Business subscriber information must be emailed to Microsoft at
uslereq@microsoft.com or faxed to (425) 708-0096. Comcast does not maintain information or
content for any business email addresses.
Other Comcast Products and Services
Our Law Enforcement Portal (https://lesrc.comcast.com) has detailed information about

retention periods for each type of customer information we maintain. If you do not have access
to the portal, please call the LESRC at 866-947-8572 for retention information.
What to Requests should include the street address, account number, phone number, email address, or other
identifiable information about the subscriber.
Include
Names. Comcast responds to requests for identification based on a name exactly as it is written
on the request. For example: if the request asks for information relating to James Doe in
Springfield and Comcast’s records reveal a J. Doe or Jim Doe in Springfield, Comcast will require
additional legal process to determine if it has responsive information. If initial or nicknames are
used, include all variation of the subject’s name.
Addresses. Requests based on an address must include the full street address, including the house
or apartment number, street name, city, state, zip, and specific period covered (subscribers at an
address may change).
Account Numbers. Incomplete account numbers cannot be processed.
Financial Information. Requests must include a complete credit card number, the date the
payment being referenced was processed, the amount of the payment, and the card issuer.
Requests involving a bank account must include the account and routing numbers.
Payment History. Requests must include the date, amount of payment(s), the account number
used to make the payment(s) or if cash was used. If a request seeks information about how a
payment was made (i.e., in person, at a store, or over the phone), it should specifically request
such information.
If an agency is in the process of obtaining a legal request, it may request that subscriber information at
Preservation
the LESRC be preserved beyond its normal retention period. Information responsive to the preservation
Requests request will be retained for 90 days, after which if no valid legal request is made or no 90-day extension
is sought, the information may be deleted in accordance with our retention periods. The 90-day extension
must be received prior to the expiration of the initial period. The use of successive or daily preservation
requests on an ongoing basis to preserve evidence will not be honored. If law enforcement or an
agency seeks real-time data after submitting a preservation request, a valid wiretap or pen register/trap
and trace order must be presented rather than successive preservation requests.
Comcast reserves the right to seek reimbursement for processing and responding to legal process as
Costs
permitted by law. Our policy is to discuss reimbursement with you before we incur any costs (except in
emergencies). Stored record disclosures generally do not incur charges unless lengthy. Wiretaps and pen
register/trap and trace orders require a substantial commitment of Comcast’s resources.
Pen Registers/Traps/Wiretaps. $1,100 for initial set-up (including the first month of intercept service or
any part thereof) and $850 for each subsequent month or any part thereof in which the order or any
extensions are active.
Special Technical Support. $500 upon implementation that spans the authorized period of each new
or renewed order and is charged at the beginning of each new or renewed authorized period. Stand-
alone email collections (header information and/or full content) will be charged in the same manner.
Requesting agencies must complete a CALEA worksheet providing detailed billing information and
authorized point(s) of contact. Billing will occur either monthly or at 60-day intervals, depending on the
volume.

blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for certain
types of calls, including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Express Call
Completion. Depending on the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities,
some calls may bypass blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all

associated with calls that bypass blocking systems.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.

Contract Id: 4888140
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:

Contract Id: 4888140
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect

Contract Id: 4888140
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.

Contract Id: 4888140
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users, non-discriminatory access to
listings, as described herein.
4.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will meet state requirements to make available listings through itself or a contracted vendor
to provide listings for its ILEC Territory, as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.2.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-
Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs
and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not provide a resale discount for
any listings.

Contract Id: 4888140
4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 Distribution of Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy per primary End
User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages directory in the
same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-21STATE’s
subscribers.
4.2.4 AT&T-21STATE shall direct its publishing vendor to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the “Information
Pages”, or comparable section of its white pages directories (covering the territory where CLEC is certified
to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair, customer service and
billing information.
4.2.5 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.5.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
4.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber

Contract Id: 4888140
list information and the subscriber list information of other companies that have authorized a similar
release of their subscriber list information by AT&T-21STATE.
4.2.6 CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE and/or its Affiliates as a result of CLEC not
complying with the terms of this Attachment.
4.2.7 This Attachment shall not establish, be interpreted as establishing, or be used by either Party to establish or
to represent their relationship as any form of agency, partnership or joint venture.
4.2.8 Breach of Contract:
4.2.8.1 If either Party is found to have materially breached the Listings terms of this Attachment, the non-
breaching Party may terminate the Listings terms of this Attachment by providing written Notice to
the breaching Party, whereupon this Attachment shall be null and void with respect to any issue of
white pages directory published sixty (60) or more calendar days after the date of receipt of such
written Notice. CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE and/or its
Affiliates and vendor as a result of such CLEC breach.
4.2.9 General Conditions for Listings:
4.2.9.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to suspend, modify or terminate,
without penalty, any Listings Service offerings that are provided under this Attachment on ninety
(90) days’ written notice in the form of an Accessible Letter.

shall pay AT&T-21STATE, within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of any bills by AT&T-21STATE,
all amounts due for actual services provided under this Attachment, plus estimated monthly charges for the
remainder of the term. Estimated charges will be based on an average of the actual monthly amounts billed
by AT&T-21STATE pursuant to this Attachment prior to its termination. The rates applicable for determining
the amount(s) under the terms outlined in this Section are those specified in the Pricing Sheet.
5.3 CLEC shall be solely responsible for any and all legal or regulatory requirements for the modification or
discontinuance of OS and/or DA products/services to CLEC End Users under this Attachment.
