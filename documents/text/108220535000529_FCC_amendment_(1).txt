Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, FracTEL, LLC hereby wishes to
submit an amendment to its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
In the original filing made today, FracTEL failed to state that their initial implementation plan
only includes the state of Florida. Therefore there is no state list attachment included in the
filing.
For any question regarding this application, please contact Aelea Christoffbrson at

Respectfu lly Submitted,
