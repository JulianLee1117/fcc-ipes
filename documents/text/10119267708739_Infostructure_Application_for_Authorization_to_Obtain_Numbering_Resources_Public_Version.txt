Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules 47 C.F.R.
§52.15(g)(3)(i), Origin Networks, LLC dba Infostructure (“Infostructure”), hereby submits to
the Commission an Application to Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”). By its
Application, Infostructure requests authority to acquire telephone numbers directly from the
North American Numbering Plan Administrator and the Pooling Administrator as an

Infostructure includes confidential Attachment A, an interconnection agreement (“ICA”)
between Infostructure and its carrier partner and interconnecting local exchange carrier.
Pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459,
Infostructure respectfully requests that the Commission withhold from public inspection and
accord confidential treatment to its ICA. This document contains trade secrets and commercial,
technical and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information
Act (“FOIA”).1

Exemption 4 of FOIA establishes that that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does
not apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 The ICA Infostructute voluntarily
submits constitutes the type of trade secret and commercial and financial information that would
otherwise not be released to the public, and meets Exemption 4 of FOIA, accordingly.3 Further,
public disclosure of confidential Attachment A to Infostructure’s Application would cause
Infostructure substantial and irreparable competitive harm.4
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5
Infostructure states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT
Infostructure seeks confidential treatment of Attachment A to its Application. Attachment A
consists of an ICA between Infostructure’s carrier partner and a local exchange carrier.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
The ICA is being voluntarily submitted to the Commission in support of the Company’s
Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED
The document for which Infostructure seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial,
financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.”6
The ICA contains trade secrets and technical information governing the relationship between
Infostructure and its carrier partner.

4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION
The ICA for which confidential protection is requested pertains to the provision of interconnected
Voice over Internet Protocol (“iVoIP”) services. Such services are available from numerous
separate entities in a market established to be highly concentrated and subject to significant
competition. The ICA contains detailed information governing operational relationships that if
available to competitors could be used to the disadvantage of Infostructure and cause substantial
competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM
Competitors could use the information contained in the ICA to establish the basis and scope of
Company operations Infostructure’s determent.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
Infostructure treats the ICA as highly confidential and exercises significant care to ensure that
such information is not disclosed to competitors, the public, or third parties.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
Infostructure does not make the redacted information to the public or to third parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
The ICA voluntarily submitted by InfoStructure. Infostructure requests that the redacted
information be treated as confidential indefinitely as the Company cannot identify a date certain
by which this information could be disclosed without causing irreparable competitive harm to.

9. ANY OTHER INFORMATION [INFOSTRUCTURE] BELIEVES MAY BE
USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY
SHOULD BE GRANTED.
Infostructure has not previously disclosed the ICA to the public. Disclosure of the ICA and its
contents could be used by numerous competitors to gain valuable competitive information and
ultimately to cause Infostructute significant competitive detriment and undermine Infostructure’s
operations. Infostructure’s request is consistent with requests made by similarly situated providers
and granted by the Commission.
