b. REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
1. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1)
Dialwave seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit A,
Confidential Exhibit C, and Confidential Exhibit D.
2. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2)
As proof of Dialwave’s compliance with 47 C.F.R. Part 9 as required by
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(E), Dialwave is submitting technical details of its 911
integration and agreement with its carrier partner as Confidential Exhibit A.
As proof of Dialwave’s facilities readiness as required by 47 C.F.R. §
52.15(g)(3)(ii)(H), Dialwave is submitting the interconnection agreement between
it and its carrier partner as Confidential Exhibit C. Dialwave is also submitting
the interconnection agreement between Dialwave’s carrier partner and a local
exchange carrier in New York as Confidential Exhibit D.
3. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3)
Confidential Exhibit A describes the technical details of Dialwave’s 911
integration. Confidential Exhibit A, Confidential Exhibit C, and Confidential
Exhibit D contain agreements between Dialwave and its carrier partner. All three
exhibits contain proprietary commercial information regarding the operations,
pricing, network, services, and operating costs of both Dialwave and its carrier
partner.
4. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4)
Confidential Exhibit A, Confidential Exhibit C, and Confidential Exhibit
D contain information relating to commercial matters that could be used to the

competitive disadvantage of Dialwave. Dialwave has numerous competitors in the
Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates.
Detailed operations and commercial information of the type provided by
Dialwave could compromise Dialwave’s position in this highly competitive
industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to
Dialwave.
5. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5)
Competitors could use Dialwave’s proprietary commercial and operational
information to Dialwave’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information about how Dialwave provides services as well as about Dialwave’s
commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally disclosed
to the public.
6. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6)
Dialwave has not disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibit A,
Confidential Exhibit C, and Confidential Exhibit D to the public.
7. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7)
Dialwave has not disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibit A,
Confidential Exhibit C, and Confidential Exhibit D to the public or third parties.
8. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(8)
Dialwave requests that Confidential Exhibit A, Confidential Exhibit C,
and Confidential Exhibit D be treated as confidential for a period of ten years.
This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information contained
in the exhibits.

9. 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(9)
The information concerns Dialwave’s proprietary network information,
related to current and planned commercial and operational information, and, as
such, is commercially sensitive.
c. CONCLUSION
Dialwave respectfully requests that the Commission grant this application for
authorization to obtain numbering resources.
Respectfully submitted,
