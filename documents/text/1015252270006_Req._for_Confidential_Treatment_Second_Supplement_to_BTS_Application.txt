Re: Business Telecommunications Services, Inc. Request for Confidential Treatment, WC Docket
No. 20-166
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Business Telecommunications Services, Inc. (“BTS”), by its attorneys, hereby requests confidential
treatment of confidential information contained in the attachment (“Attachment”) to its Second Supplement
(“Second Supplement”) to its application requesting authority, in its capacity as a provider of interconnected
Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services, to directly obtain numbering resources from the North
American Numbering Plan Administrator and the Pooling Administrator (“Application”).1 At the request of
the Wireline Competition Bureau, a public copy of the Second Supplement and its Attachment are being
filed via ECFS today.
The Second Supplement contains confidential proprietary business information. Such information is
exempted from mandatory disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”)2 and
Section 0.457(d) of the Commission’s rules.3 Exemption 4 allows the withholding of commercial or
financial information that is privileged or confidential.4 The Supreme Court recently clarified that the
confidentiality requirement is satisfied when confidential proprietary business information is “customarily
1 See Business Telecommunications Services, Inc., Application for Authority to Obtain Direct Access
to Numbering Resources Pursuant to 52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 20-166
(filed Jun. 11, 2020) (“Application”).
2 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or
financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” Id.
3 47 C.F.R. § 0.457(d). See S. Co., Request for Waiver of Section 90.629 of the Commission’s Rules,
Memorandum Opinion and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 1851, para. 17 (WTB 1998).

and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an assurance of privacy.”5
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, BTS requests that the information and
documents included in the Attachment to this Second Supplement to the Application be withheld from
public inspection.6
The information for which BTS requests confidential treatment provides completely sensitive
information about BTS’s contractual arrangements with other service providers. In particular, the
Attachment contains a service order between BTS and Peerless Networks, Inc. The Attachment includes
proprietary and completely sensitive information, such as the rates, terms and conditions upon which it
receives wholesale inputs to its services, that is not customarily disclosed to the public or within the
industry.7 The market for the services provided, including the services offered by BTS, is highly
competitive.8 BTS derives independent economic value from the fact that such significant, detailed
proprietary information regarding its internal operations and business activities is unknown to its
competitors.9 Moreover, failure to treat the Company’s designated information and documents as
confidential would provide competitors with an unfair competitive advantage by being granted access to
valuable commercial and financial information of BTS.10 The designated confidential information in the
Attachment to the Second Supplement is provided only to those employees and contractors that require such
information to perform the requirements of their duties to BTS.11 The information that is the subject of this
confidential treatment request is not part of the public record in any jurisdiction.12
In the event that any person or entity requests disclosure of the designated confidential information
or documents, please notify counsel for BTS immediately in order to permit it to oppose such a request or
take such other action to safeguard its interests as it deems necessary.13 After the Commission concludes its
review, BTS requests the return of the confidential information to counsel. However, in the event that the
Commission has reason to keep the confidential materials after the conclusion of this proceeding, BTS
requests that all materials be kept under protective seal, as no passage of time will negate the confidential
nature of the designated information and documents in the Second Supplement.14
