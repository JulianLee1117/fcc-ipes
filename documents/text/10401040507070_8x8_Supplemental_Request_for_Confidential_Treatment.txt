Re: 8x8, Inc. Supplement to Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources & Request for Confidential Treatment
WC Docket No. 20-19
Dear Ms. Dortch,
8x8, Inc. (“8x8”) hereby encloses for filing a Supplement to its previously-filed Application to
Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit C, an
additional interconnection agreement between 8x8 and an affiliate of its carrier partner
(“Additional Interconnection Agreement”). The Additional Interconnection Agreement consists
of the original Master Services Agreement between the carrier partner affiliate and 8x8 and
includes several Annexes. The Supplement and Additional Interconnection Agreement are sent
to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
8x8 respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to the Additional Interconnection Agreement. This document contains
trade secrets and commercial, technical and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of
the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 8x8 is voluntarily providing this trade secret and
commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover,
8x8 would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Additional Interconnection Agreement were
disclosed.4 8x8 treats the Additional Interconnection Agreement as private and provides it with
the understanding that the Bureau will treat it as private.5

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,6 8x8
hereby states as follows:
1. Identification of the Specific Information for Which Confidential Treatment
Is Sought7
8x8 seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit C, an additional interconnection
agreement between 8x8 and an affiliate of its carrier partner (“Additional Interconnection
Agreement”).
2. Description of Circumstances Giving Rise To the Submission8
The Additional Interconnection Agreement is being submitted to the Commission in
conformity with the referenced docket number.
3. Explanation of the Degree to Which the Information Is Commercial or
Financial, or Contains a Trade Secret or Is Privileged9
The information for which 8x8 seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors.”10 The Additional Interconnection Agreement contains trade secrets and technical
information relating to the manner in which 8x8 and its carrier partner conduct network
operations.
4. Explanation of the Degree to Which the Information Concerns a Service
That Is Subject to Competition11
The Additional Interconnection Agreement contains detailed information relating to
operational matters that could be used by competitors to the disadvantage of 8x8. Disclosure of
8x8’s confidential information would cause substantial competitive harm.
5. Explanation of How Disclosure of the Information Could Result In
Substantial Competitive Harm12
Competitors could use the information in the Additional Interconnection Agreement to
8x8’s detriment.
6. Identification of Any Measures Taken By the Submitting Party to Prevent
Unauthorized Disclosure13
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).

8x8 has made the substance of the Additional Interconnection Agreement known only to
those employees who have a need to know the subject matter, and those employees are aware of
the confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The Additional Interconnection
Agreement has not been disclosed by 8x8 to any non-signatories outside 8x8 except pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality agreements.
7. Identification of Whether the Information Is Available to the Public and the
Extent of Any Previous Disclosure of the Information to Third Parties14
8x8 has not previously disclosed the Additional Interconnection Agreement to the public.
8. Justification of the Period During Which the Submitting Party Asserts That
Material Should Not Be Available For Public Disclosure15
8x8 requests that the Additional Interconnection Agreement be treated as confidential for
a period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in
the Additional Interconnection Agreement.
9. Other Information That 8x8 Believes May Be Useful In Assessing Whether
Its Request for Confidentiality Should Be Granted16
The disclosure of the name of 8x8’s carrier partner could be used to the competitive
detriment of 8x8.
Respectfully submitted,
