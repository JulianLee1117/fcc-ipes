Telnyx LLC (“Telnyx”), pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules,
respectfully requests authorization to obtain numbering resources as described below.
Under the Commission’s Numbering Order,1 an interconnected VoIP provider may obtain
numbering resources from the Numbering Administrator upon a showing that it is authorized to
provide service in the area for which the numbering resources are requested. Such authorization
may be obtained upon an application to the Commission containing the information detailed in
Sections 52.15(g)(3)(i)(A)-(F) of the Commission’s Rules. Telnyx hereby requests the
Commission grant it that authorization. In support of this application, Telnyx states that its OCN is
073H and that the numbers will be primarily used in providing voice over Internet protocol services.
It also provides the following information:(cid:3)

(B) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(B)
(cid:3)
Telnyx acknowledges that authorization to obtain numbering resources under Section
52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules is subject to compliance with applicable Commission
numbering rules as well as to the numbering authority delegated to the states. Telnyx also
acknowledges that this authorization is subject to compliance with industry guidelines and
practices regarding numbering, as applicable to telecommunications carriers.
(cid:3)
(C) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(C)
(cid:3)
Telnyx acknowledges that it must file requests for numbers with the relevant state
commission(s) at least 30 days before requesting numbers from the Numbering Administrators.
(cid:3)
(D) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D)
(cid:3)
Telnyx is fully capable of providing service within 60 days of the numbering resources
activation date. Telnyx has an OCN, appears in the LERG and NPAC in the IPES category, has
an agreement in place with its CLEC partner for routing traffic to ILECs, and has, in some cases,
negotiated direct IP interconnection with ILECs. In addition, Telnyx has developed porting
processes to enable carriers to submit porting requests and has accomplished bulk ports with no
difficulty. As a result, Telnyx already has in place the necessary procedures to enable it to place
numbers into service within 60 days of activation. Under its current agreements and established
procedures, Telnyx will be able to place nearly all numbers into service within 60 days of
activation.
As proof of its facilities readiness, Telnyx has attached to this application (1) an
agreement between Telnyx and its carrier partner providing that the carrier partner will host
2
(cid:3)

Telnyx numbers on its switches and provide PSTN connectivity for inbound calls to Telnyx
numbers and (2) an interconnection agreement between Telnyx’s carrier partner (under a previous
company name) and a local exchange carrier. These documents are Exhibits A and B to this
application. Telnyx has requested confidential treatment under the Commission’s rules for both
Exhibits and has filed them separately.
(E) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(E)
(cid:3)
Telnyx certifies that it complies with its Universal Service Fund contribution obligations
under 47 CFR part 54, subpart H, its Telecommunications Relay Service contribution obligations
under 47 CFR § 64.604(c)(5)(iii), its North American Numbering Plan and Local Number
Portability Administration contribution obligations under 47 CFR §§ 52.17 and 52.32, its
obligations to pay regulatory fees under 47 CFR § 1.1154, and its 911 obligations under 47 CFR
part 9.
(F) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(F)
Telnyx certifies that it has the financial, managerial, and technical expertise to provide
reliable service. It is financially stable, is led by a strong, experienced team of individuals with
substantial managerial experience in the telecommunications industry, and has sufficient technical
expertise and infrastructure in place to provide reliable numbering services.
Telnyx has the financial stability required to ensure the reliable provisioning of its
communications services, including numbering, throughout its service area. Telnyx has
successfully operated its communications business since 2009. It anticipates much of the funding
for its network buildout and operations will come from revenues from existing operations, as well
as a debt facility with Comerica Incorporated.
One factor in this long-term stability has been Telnyx’s consistent fulfillment of its
regulatory obligations and membership in the regulated community. Telnyx remains in good

regulatory standing with the FCC and possesses an FCC authorization under Section 214 of the
Communications Act.
Telnyx also has the superior technical and managerial qualifications necessary to provide
and maintain successful operations within its service area. The company is a Tier II Internet
Service Provider that currently operates its own private fiber backhaul network with points of
presence in three of the busiest Internet hubs globally: San Jose, CA, Chicago, IL, and Ashburn,
VA. Telnyx owns and manages a substantial amount of IP address space, is a participant on
numerous Internet Exchanges, and physically interconnects with the four largest public cloud
operators in the world. Telnyx also successfully passes IP voice traffic directly to several large
carriers, including Verizon, AT&T, Windstream and Comcast. These interconnections, combined
with its own private network, provide Telnyx with the capability to ensure the continued
provisioning of quality services to customers.
Telnyx’s management team has extensive business and network management experience
in telecommunications-related businesses and in serving its targeted customer segment –
telecommunications carriers, IP service providers, and enterprises. These individuals lead a team
of 20+ network, telephony, and software engineers that is highly qualified to manage the
operations of Telnyx throughout its service area. Telnyx’s key management and technical
