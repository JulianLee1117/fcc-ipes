REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of E. Ritter Communications, LLC DBA Ritter
Communications and DBA RightFiber; Application of E. Ritter Communications, LLC DBA Ritter
Communications and DBA RightFiber for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Pursuant to Section 52.lS{g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 25-
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 E. Ritter Communications, LLC DBA Ritter
Communications and DBA RightFiber ("Ritter Communications") hereby submits its Application for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
Ritter Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment
to Exhibits A, C and E to the application because the documents contain sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, Ritter Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.
Exhibits A, C and E are accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT -NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, Ritter Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
Ritter Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits A, C and E to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
Ritter Communications is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as
proof of Ritter Communications' facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 1S(g)(3)(i)(D) ofthe
Commission's Rules. Ritter Communications is submitting as Exhibit C its 911 Trunking Order as
proof that it complies with the 911 and 988 obligations under part 9 of the relevant chapter. Ritter
Communications is submitting as Exhibit E proof of filing its FCC Form 499Q.
47 C.F.R. § 52.lS(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for "trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."

Page 2 of 3
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which Ritter Communications seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A
describes the agreement between Ritter Communications and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning Ritter Communications' network, customers, and
services. Exhibit C outlines Ritter Communications' compliance with its 911 and 988 obligations,
which contain proprietary information concerning Ritter Communications' network, customers,
and services. Exhibit E contains revenue information on its FCC Form 499-Q that is proprietary
and confidential in nature and should not be disclosed to the public.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoIP providers to compromise Ritter Communications' position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by Ritter Communications could compromise Ritter
Communications' position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this
information would result in substantial competitive harm to Ritter Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use Ritter Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to Ritter Communications' detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning Ritter Communications' commercial agreements, as well as information
as to how Ritter Communications provides its services. The prices and terms for the provision of
such services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure
of the Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to Ritter Communications'
carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
Ritter Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibits A, C and E to the public;
Ritter Communications is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement,
except as expressly authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
Ritter Communications does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or
that the Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a
non-disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
Ritter Communications requests that Exhibits A, C and E be withheld from public disclosure
indefinitely. Ritter Communications and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to
remain in effect indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their
substance would cause competitive harm to Ritter Communications' carrier partner regarding of
the timing of the disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT RITTER COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns Ritter Communications' proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, Ritter Communications respectfully requests that Exhibits A, C and Ebe granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
The $1485 filing fee has been remitted using the CORES fee payment system.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 470-672-3933 or
via email to nelson.fernandez@jsitel.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Sincerely,

8. END USER FRAUD
8.1 AT&T-13STATE shall not be liable to CLEC for any fraud associated with CLEC’s End User’s account,
including 1+ IntraLATA toll, ported numbers, and Alternate Billing Traffic (ABT). ABT is a service that

are three types of ABT calls: calling card, collect, and third number billed calls.
8.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in
cases of fraud involving 1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties’ fraud
minimization procedures are to be cost-effective and implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm
one Party as compared to the other.
8.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in
Section 8.2 will include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning Customers
who terminate services to that Party without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such
information is responsible for securing the End User's permission to obtain such information.

CLEC on suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud on CLEC accounts stored in the applicable LIDB.

8.4.1 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE (on behalf of itself and AT&T CONNECTICUT) and
AT&T CALIFORNIA will use a Fraud Monitoring System to determine suspected occurrences of
ABT-related fraud for CLEC using the same criteria AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE and
AT&T CALIFORNIA use to monitor fraud on their respective accounts.
8.4.2 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of
fraud. CLEC understands and agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to
determine whether a fraud situation actually exists. CLEC understands and agrees that it will
also need to determine what, if any, action CLEC should take as a result of a Fraud Monitoring
System alert.
8.4.3 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud
Monitoring System alert notification.
8.5 In AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T CALIFORNIA ABT-related alerts are provided to
CLEC at no additional charge, except as related in 8.6 below.

9.2 Assurance of payment may be requested by AT&T-12STATE if:
9.2.1 at the Effective Date CLEC had not already established satisfactory credit by having made at
least twelve (12) consecutive months of timely payments to AT&T-13STATE for charges
incurred as a CLEC; or
9.2.2 in AT&T-12STATE’s reasonable judgment, at the Effective Date or at any time thereafter, there
has been an impairment of the established credit, financial health, or credit worthiness of CLEC.
Such impairment will be determined from information available from financial sources, including

information about CLEC that may be considered includes, but is not limited to, investor warning
briefs, rating downgrades, and articles discussing pending credit problems; or
9.2.3 CLEC fails to timely pay a bill rendered to CLEC by AT&T-12STATE (except such portion of a
bill that is subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all
requirements set forth in Section 11.3); or
9.2.4 CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a
voluntary case (or has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any other law relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition
or adjustment of debts or the like, has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is
subject to a receivership or similar proceeding.

beneficiary(ies) thereof and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to AT&T-12STATE
(“Letter of Credit”).
9.3.3 The Cash Deposit or Letter of Credit must be in an amount equal to three (3) months anticipated
charges (including, but not limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges,
termination charges and advance payments), as reasonably determined by AT&T-12STATE, for
the Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation or any
other functions, facilities, products or services to be furnished by AT&T-12STATE under this
Agreement.
9.3.3.1 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION
5-STATE will not request assurance of payment of charges reasonably anticipated by
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE to be incurred in Arkansas in an amount that
would exceed one (1) month’s projected bill for CLEC’s initial market entry; provided,
however, that after three (3) months of operation, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE may request assurance of payment of charges reasonably anticipated by AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE to be incurred in Arkansas in an amount not to exceed
two times projected average monthly billing to CLEC.
9.3.3.2 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION
5-STATE will not request assurance of payment of charges reasonably anticipated by
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE to be incurred in Oklahoma in an amount that
would exceed two times projected average monthly billing to CLEC.
9.4 To the extent that AT&T-12STATE elects to require a Cash Deposit, the Parties intend that the
provision of such Cash Deposit shall constitute the grant of a security interest in the Cash Deposit
pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any relevant jurisdiction.

9.6 AT&T-12STATE may, but is not obligated to, draw on the Letter of Credit or the Cash Deposit, as
applicable, upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:
9.6.1 CLEC owes AT&T-12STATE undisputed charges under this Agreement that are more than thirty
(30) calendar days past due; or
9.6.2 CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a
voluntary case (or has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any other law relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition
or adjustment of debts or the like, has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is
subject to a receivership or similar proceeding; or
9.6.3 The expiration or termination of this Agreement.
9.7 If AT&T-12STATE draws on the Letter of Credit or Cash Deposit, upon request by AT&T-12STATE,
CLEC will provide a replacement or supplemental letter of credit or cash deposit conforming to the
requirements of Section 9.3.
9.8 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if AT&T-12STATE makes a request for
assurance of payment in accordance with the terms of this Section, then AT&T-12STATE shall have no
obligation thereafter to perform under this Agreement until such time as CLEC has furnished AT&T-
12STATE with the assurance of payment requested; provided, however, that AT&T-12STATE will
permit CLEC a minimum of ten (10) Business Days to respond to a request for assurance of payment
before invoking this Section.

month period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “satisfactory payment” shall mean that
payment was made after the date the bill is due no more than one time during the twelve month period
and that no payment was made by a check that was subsequently dishonored. If the CLEC does not
meet these refund criteria, the deposit may be retained for an additional six months, at the end of which
another review will be made to determine whether CLEC has made satisfactory payment (as defined in
the preceding sentence) of all charges within the twelve months immediately preceding that review.
9.10 The fact that a Cash Deposit or Letter of Credit is requested by AT&T-12STATE shall in no way relieve
CLEC from timely compliance with all payment obligations under this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination charges and advance
payments), nor does it constitute a waiver or modification of the terms of this Agreement pertaining to
disconnection or re-entry for non-payment of any amounts required to be paid hereunder.

that the payment is actually made and available.
10.2 If any charge incurred by AT&T-13STATE under this Agreement is Past Due, the unpaid amounts will

lesser of (i) the rate used to compute the Late Payment Charge contained in the applicable AT&T-

11.9 Limitation on Back-billing and Credit Claims:
11.9.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party shall be entitled to
11.9.1.1 Back-bill for or claim credit for any charges for services provided pursuant to this
Agreement that are found to be unbilled, under-billed or over-billed, but only when such

months immediately preceding the date on which the Billing Party provided written
notice to the Billed Party of the amount of the back-billing or the Billed Party provided
written notice to the Billing Party of the claimed credit amount. The Parties agree that

may only include billing periods that fall entirely after the Effective Date of this
Agreement and will not include any portion of any billing period that began prior to the
Effective Date of this Agreement.
11.9.1.2 Back-billing and credit claims, as limited above, will apply to all Interconnection, Resale
Services, Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, facilities, functions, product and

discovered with the exercise of due care and attention.
12.1.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party shall be entitled to
dispute only those charges which appeared on a bill dated within the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding the date on which the Billing Party received notice of such Disputed
Amounts.

12.3 Commencing Dispute Resolution

Dispute Resolution methods:
12.3.1.1 Service Center (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), LSC (AT&T-7STATE) or LEC-C
(AT&T CONNECTICUT) or Collocation Service Center (CSC);
12.3.1.2 Informal Dispute Resolution; and
12.3.1.3 Formal Dispute Resolution, each of which is described below.
12.4 LSC/Service Center/LEC-C or CSC Dispute Resolution - the following Dispute Resolution procedures

12.4.1 If the written notice given pursuant to Section 12.3 discloses that a CLEC dispute relates to
billing, then the procedures set forth in this Section 12.4 shall be used and the dispute shall first
be referred to the appropriate service center AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE Service
Center; AT&T-7STATE Local Service Center (LSC); AT&T CONNECTICUT Local Exchange
Carrier Center (LEC-C)] for resolution. In order to resolve a billing dispute, CLEC shall furnish
AT&T-13STATE written notice of (i) the date of the bill in question, (ii) CBA/ESBA/ASBS or BAN
number of the bill in question, (iii) telephone number, circuit ID number or trunk number in
question, (iv) any USOC information relating to the item questioned, (v) amount billed and (vi)
amount in question and (vii) the reason that CLEC disputes the billed amount. To be deemed a
“dispute” under this Section 12.4, CLEC must provide evidence that it has either paid the
disputed amount or established an interest bearing escrow account that complies with the
requirements set forth in Section 10.6 of this Agreement and deposited all Unpaid Charges
relating to Resale Services and Lawful Unbundled Network Elements into that escrow account.
Failure to provide the information and evidence required by this Section 12.4.1 not later than
twenty-nine (29) calendar days following the Bill Due Date shall constitute CLEC’s irrevocable
and full waiver of its right to dispute the subject charges.
12.4.2 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on AT&T-13STATE’s current
billing statements thirty (30) to sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided the
CLEC furnishes all requisite information and evidence under Section 12.4.1 by the Bill Due
Date). If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days, upon request, AT&T-13STATE will notify
CLEC of the status of the dispute and the expected resolution date.
12.4.3 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on statements prior to the
current billing statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days, but resolution may take
longer depending on the complexity of the dispute. If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date notice of the Disputed Amounts was received (provided that CLEC furnishes
all requisite information and evidence under Section 12.4.1), AT&T-13STATE will notify CLEC of
the status of the dispute and the expected resolution date.
12.4.4 Any notice of Disputed Amounts given by AT&T-13STATE to CLEC pursuant to Section 12.3
shall furnish CLEC written notice of: (i) the date of the bill in question, (ii) the account number or
other identification of the bill in question, (iii) any telephone number, circuit ID number or trunk
number in question, (iv) any USOC (or other descriptive information) questioned, (v) the amount
billed, (vi) the amount in question, and (vii) the reason that AT&T-13STATE disputes the billed
amount. The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on current billing
statement(s) thirty (30) to sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided AT&T-
13STATE, furnishes all requisite information by the Bill Due Date) and Disputed Amounts
appearing on statements prior to the current billing statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90)
calendar days, but resolution may take longer depending on the complexity of the dispute. If not
resolved within thirty (30) calendar days, CLEC will notify AT&T-13STATE of the status of the
dispute and the expected resolution date.
12.4.5 If the Non-Paying Party is not satisfied by the resolution of the billing dispute under this Section
12.4, the Non-Paying Party may notify the Billing Party in writing that it wishes to invoke the
Informal Resolution of Disputes afforded pursuant to Section 12.5 of this Agreement.
12.5 Informal Resolution of Disputes
12.5.1 Upon receipt by one Party of notice of a dispute by the other Party pursuant to Section 12.3 or
Section 12.4.5, each Party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The location, form,
frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions will be left to the discretion of the
representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative Dispute
Resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and the
correspondence among the representatives for purposes of settlement are exempt from

discovery and production and will not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any
lawsuit without the concurrence of both Parties. Documents identified in or provided with such
communications that were not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so exempted,
and, if otherwise admissible, may be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.
12.6 Formal Dispute Resolution
12.6.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the informal procedure described in
Section 12.5, then either Party may invoke the formal Dispute Resolution procedures described
in this Section 12.6. Unless agreed among all Parties, formal Dispute Resolution procedures,
including arbitration or other procedures as appropriate, may be invoked not earlier than sixty
(60) calendar days after receipt of the letter initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 12.3.
12.6.2 Claims Subject to Mandatory Arbitration. The following claims, if not settled through informal
Dispute Resolution, will be subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to Section 12.7 below:
12.6.2.1 Each unresolved billing dispute involving one percent (1%) or less of the amounts
charged to the Disputing Party under this Agreement in the state in which the dispute
arises during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding receipt of the letter
initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 12.3. If the disputing Party has not been
billed for a minimum of twelve (12) months immediately preceding receipt of the letter
initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 12.3, the Parties will annualize the actual
number of months billed.
12.6.3 Claims Subject to Elective Arbitration. Claims will be subject to elective arbitration pursuant to
Section 12.7 if, and only if, the claim is not settled through informal Dispute Resolution and both
Parties agree to arbitration. If both Parties do not agree to arbitration, then either Party may
proceed with any remedy available to it pursuant to law, equity or agency mechanism.
12.6.4 Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. If the following claims are not resolved through informal
Dispute Resolution, they will not be subject to arbitration and must be resolved through any
remedy available to a Party pursuant to law, equity or agency mechanism.
12.6.4.1 Actions seeking a temporary restraining order or an injunction related to the purposes of
this Agreement.
12.6.4.2 Actions to compel compliance with the Dispute Resolution process.
12.6.4.3 All claims arising under federal or state statute(s), including antitrust claims.
12.7 Arbitration
12.7.1 Disputes subject to mandatory or elective arbitration under the provisions of this Agreement will
be submitted to a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association or pursuant to such other provider of arbitration services or rules as the
Parties may agree. The arbitrator shall be knowledgeable of telecommunications issues. Each
arbitration will be held in Dallas, Texas (AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE); Chicago,
Illinois (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), San Francisco, California (AT&T
CALIFORNIA); Reno, Nevada (AT&T NEVADA); or New Haven, Connecticut (AT&T
CONNECTICUT), as appropriate, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitration hearing
will be requested to commence within sixty (60) calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The
arbitrator will control the scheduling so as to process the matter expeditiously. The Parties may
submit written briefs upon a schedule determined by the arbitrator. The Parties will request that
the arbitrator rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30) calendar days after
the close of hearings. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Secs. 1-16, not state law, shall
govern the arbitrability of all disputes. Notwithstanding any rule of the AAA Commercial
Arbitration Rules to the contrary, the Parties agree that the arbitrator will have no authority to
award punitive damages, exemplary damages, Consequential Damages, multiple damages, or
any other damages not measured by the prevailing Party's actual damages, and may not, in any

event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The times specified in this Section may be extended or shortened upon mutual
agreement of the Parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Each Party will
bear its own costs of these procedures, including attorneys’ fees. The Parties will equally split

Party, immediately compensate Auditing Party for such undercharge, and (iii) in each case,
calculate and pay interest as provided in Section 10.1 (depending on the AT&T-owned ILEC(s)
involved), for the number of calendar days from the date on which such undercharge or
overcharge originated until the date on which such credit is issued or payment is made and
available.
13.1.6 Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, audits shall be performed at Auditing
Party’s expense, subject to reimbursement by Audited Party of one-quarter (1/4) of any

charges for the audited services during the period covered by the audit.

13.2.1 Except as provided in Appendix Compensation, AT&T CONNECTICUT shall arrange for one (1)
annual independent audit to be conducted by a “Big Six” independent public accounting firm or
an accounting firm mutually agreed to by AT&T CONNECTICUT, CLEC and all other CLECs
doing business with AT&T CONNECTICUT under the terms of an agreement adopted pursuant
to Sections 251 and 252 of the Act for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of AT&T
CONNECTICUT’s billing and invoicing.

PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WHEN SUCH DATA OR INFORMATION IS ACCESSED AND USED
BY A THIRD PARTY.
15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
15.1 Except for indemnity obligations expressly set forth herein or as otherwise expressly provided in
specific appendices, each Party’s liability to the other Party for any Loss relating to or arising out of
such Party’s performance under this Agreement, including any negligent act or omission (whether willful
or inadvertent), whether in contract, tort or otherwise, including alleged breaches of this Agreement and
causes of action alleged to arise from allegations that breach of this Agreement also constitute a
violation of a statute, including the Act, shall not exceed in total the amount AT&T-13STATE or CLEC
has charged or would have charged to the other Party for the affected Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, or functions, facilities, products and
service(s) that were not performed or provided or were improperly performed or provided.
15.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in specific appendices, in the case of any Loss alleged or
claimed by a Third Party to have arisen out of the negligence or willful misconduct of any Party, each
Party shall bear, and its obligation shall be limited to, that portion (as mutually agreed to by the Parties
or as otherwise established) of the resulting expense caused by its own negligence or willful
misconduct or that of its agents, servants, contractors, or others acting in aid or concert with it.
15.3 A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and contracts with its End Users or Third Parties
that relate to any Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions,
facilities, products and services provided or contemplated under this Agreement that, to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Party shall not be liable to such End User or Third Party for (i)
any Loss relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds
the amount such Party would have charged the End User or Third Party for the Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services that gave
rise to such Loss and (ii) any Consequential Damages. If a Party elects not to place in its tariffs or
contracts such limitation(s) of liability, and the other Party incurs a Loss as a result thereof, the first
Party shall indemnify and reimburse the other Party for that portion of the Loss that would have been
limited had the first Party included in its tariffs and contracts the limitation(s) of liability described in this
Section.
15.4 Neither CLEC nor AT&T-13STATE shall be liable to the other Party for any Consequential Damages
suffered by the other Party, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty, strict liability,
tort or otherwise, including negligence of any kind, whether active or passive (and including alleged
breaches of this Agreement and causes of action alleged to arise from allegations that breach of this
Agreement constitutes a violation of the Act or other statute), and regardless of whether the Parties
knew or had been advised of the possibility that such damages could result in connection with or arising
from anything said, omitted, or done hereunder or related hereto, including willful acts or omissions;
provided that the foregoing shall not limit a Party’s obligation under Section 16 to indemnify, defend,
and hold the other Party harmless against any amounts payable to a Third Party, including any Losses,
and Consequential Damages of such Third Party; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 15.4
shall impose indemnity obligations on a Party for any Loss or Consequential Damages suffered by that
Party’s End User in connection with any affected Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements, Collocation, functions, facilities, products and services. Except as provided in the
prior sentence, each Party (“Indemnifying Party”) hereby releases and holds harmless the other Party
(“Indemnitee”) (and Indemnitee’s Affiliates, and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents)
against any Loss or Claim made by the Indemnifying Party’s End User.
15.5 AT&T-13STATE shall not be liable for damages to an End User’s premises resulting from the furnishing
of any Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities,
products or services, including, if applicable, the installation and removal of equipment and associated
wiring, and Collocation Equipment unless the damage is caused by AT&T-13STATE’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct. AT&T-13STATE does not guarantee or make any warranty with

respect to Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation,
functions, facilities, products or services when used in an explosive atmosphere.
15.6 CLEC hereby releases AT&T-13STATE from any and all liability for damages due to errors or
omissions in CLEC’s End User listing information as provided by CLEC to AT&T-13STATE under this
Agreement, including any errors or omissions occurring in CLEC’s End User listing information as it
appears in the White Pages directory, including, but not limited to, special, indirect, Consequential,
punitive or incidental damages.
15.7 AT&T-13STATE shall not be liable to CLEC, its End User or any other Person for any Loss alleged to
arise out of the provision of access to 911 service or any errors, interruptions, defects, failures or
malfunctions of 911 service.
15.8 This Section 15 is not intended to exempt any Party from all liability under this Agreement, but only to
set forth the scope of liability agreed to and the type of damages that are recoverable. Both Parties
acknowledge that they negotiated regarding alternate limitation of liability provisions but that such
provisions would have altered the cost, and thus the price, of providing the Interconnection, Resale
Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services available
hereunder, and no different pricing reflecting different costs and different limits of liability was agreed to.
16. INDEMNITY
16.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific appendices, each Party shall be
responsible only for the Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements,
Collocation, functions, facilities, products and services which are provided by that Party, its authorized
agents, subcontractors, or others retained by such Parties, and neither Party shall bear any
responsibility for the Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, functions,
facilities, products and services provided by the other Party, its agents, subcontractors, or others
retained by such Parties.
16.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific appendices, and to the extent not
prohibited by Applicable Law and not otherwise controlled by tariff, each Party (the “Indemnifying
Party”) shall release, defend and indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”) and hold such
Indemnified Party harmless against any Loss to a Third Party arising out of the negligence or willful
misconduct (“Fault”) of such Indemnifying Party, its agents, its End Users, contractors, or others
retained by such Parties, in connection with the Indemnifying Party’s provision of Interconnection,
Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, functions, facilities, products and
services under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) with respect to employees or agents of the
Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their employment, (ii) with
respect to subcontractors of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing
duties of the subcontractor under its subcontract with the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) with respect to the
Fault of employees or agents of such subcontractor, such Fault occurs while performing within the
scope of their employment by the subcontractor with respect to such duties of the subcontractor under
the subcontract.
16.3 In the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a End User of either Party, the Party whose End User
alleged or claimed such Loss (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend and indemnify the other Party (the
“Indemnified Party”) against any and all such Claims or Losses by its End User regardless of whether
the underlying Interconnection, Resale Service, Lawful Unbundled Network Element, Collocation,
function, facility, product or service giving rise to such Claim or Loss was provided or provisioned by the
Indemnified Party, unless the Claim or Loss was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Indemnified Party.
16.4 A Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party
(“Indemnified Party”) against any Claim or Loss arising from the Indemnifying Party’s use of
Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, functions,
facilities, products and services provided under this Agreement involving:

extent of such payment.
16.7 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each Party agrees that should it cause any non-
standard digital subscriber line (“xDSL”) technologies (as that term is defined in the applicable Appendix

16.8.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion, in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of
the defense of such claim and the identity of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party.
16.8.3 Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides written notice of acceptance of the defense of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, subject to any right of the Indemnifying Party to seek reimbursement for the costs of such
defense in the event that it is determined that Indemnifying Party had no obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party for such claim.
16.8.4 Upon accepting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control and
conduct the defense and settlement of any such claims, subject to consultation with the
Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is controlling and conducting the defense,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such
Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in advance and agrees to be bound by the
agreement incorporating such settlement.
16.8.5 At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise or settlement, and,
at such refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that, in such event the
Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the refusing
Party against, any cost or liability in excess of such refused compromise or settlement.
16.8.6 With respect to any defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will be
entitled to participate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the claim requests equitable
relief or other relief that could affect the rights of the Indemnified Party, and shall also be entitled
to employ separate counsel for such defense at such Indemnified Party's expense.
16.8.7 If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any indemnified claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel for such defense at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party.
16.8.8 In the event of a failure to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may negotiate a
settlement, which shall be presented to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party refuses
to agree to the presented settlement, the Indemnifying Party may take over the defense. If the
Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented settlement and refuses to take over the
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any reasonable cash settlement not involving
any admission of liability by the Indemnifying Party, though such settlement may have been
made by the Indemnified Party without approval of the Indemnifying Party, it being the Parties’
intent that no settlement involving a non-monetary concession by the Indemnifying Party,
including an admission of liability by such Party, shall take effect without the written approval of
the Indemnifying Party.
16.8.9 Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause its employees and agents to cooperate with the
other Party in the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each Party shall be

amended from time to time.
34.3 With respect to any purchase of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network
Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement if any Tax is required or
permitted by Applicable Law to be collected from the purchasing Party by the providing Party, then: (i)
the providing Party shall bill the purchasing Party for such Tax; (ii) the purchasing Party shall remit such
Tax to the providing Party; and (iii) the providing Party shall remit such collected Tax to the applicable
taxing authority. Failure to include Taxes on an invoice or to state a Tax separately shall not impair the
obligation of the purchasing Party to pay any Tax. Nothing shall prevent the providing Party from
paying any Tax to the appropriate taxing authority prior to the time: (i) it bills the purchasing Party for
such Tax, or (ii) it collects the Tax from the purchasing Party. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the purchasing Party shall be liable for and the providing Party may collect
Taxes which were assessed by or paid to an appropriate taxing authority within the statute of limitations
period but not included on an invoice within four (4) years after the Tax otherwise was owed or due.
34.4 With respect to any purchase hereunder of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement that are resold to a
third party, if any Tax is imposed by Applicable Law on the End User in connection with any such
purchase, then: (i) the purchasing Party shall be required to impose and/or collect such Tax from the
End User; and (ii) the purchasing Party shall remit such Tax to the applicable taxing authority. The

authority.
34.5 If the providing Party fails to bill or to collect any Tax as required herein, then, as between the providing
Party and the purchasing Party: (i) the purchasing Party shall remain liable for such uncollected Tax;
and (ii) the providing Party shall be liable for any penalty and interest assessed with respect to such

by the applicable taxing authority to collect the Tax from the providing Party due to the failure of the
purchasing Party to pay or collect and remit such Tax to such authority.
34.7 If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other Governmental Authority, the other Party agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to any audit inquiries in a proper
and timely manner so that the audit and/or any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.
34.8 To the extent a sale is claimed to be for resale and thus subject to tax exemption, the purchasing Party
shall furnish the providing Party a proper resale tax exemption certificate as authorized or required by
statute or regulation of the jurisdiction providing said resale tax exemption. Failure to timely provide
said resale tax exemption certificate will result in no exemption being available to the purchasing Party
for any period prior to the date that the purchasing Party presents a valid certificate. If Applicable Law
excludes or exempts a purchase of Interconnection, Resale Services, Lawful Unbundled Network
Elements, functions, facilities, products and services under this Agreement from a Tax, but does not
also provide an exemption procedure, then the providing Party will not collect such Tax if the
purchasing Party (a) furnishes the providing Party with a letter signed by an officer of the purchasing
Party claiming an exemption and identifying the Applicable Law that both allows such exemption and
does not require an exemption certificate; and (b) supplies the providing Party with an indemnification
agreement, reasonably acceptable to the providing Party, which holds the providing Party harmless
from any tax, interest, penalties, loss, cost or expense with respect to forbearing to collect such Tax.
34.9 With respect to any Tax or Tax controversy covered by this Section 34, the purchasing Party is entitled
to contest with the imposing jurisdiction, pursuant to Applicable Law and at its own expense, any Tax
that it is ultimately obligated to pay or collect. The purchasing Party will ensure that no lien is attached
to any asset of the providing Party as a result of any contest. The purchasing Party shall be entitled to
the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts that it had previously paid resulting from such a
contest. Amounts previously paid by the providing Party shall be refunded to the providing Party. The
providing Party will cooperate in any such contest.

by either Party to the other under this Section 34 shall be sent in accordance with Section 19 hereof.

35.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
consent to any default under this Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and
properly executed by or on behalf of the Party against whom such waiver or consent is claimed. Waiver
by either Party of any default by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default.
Failure of either Party to insist on performance of any term or condition of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or future waiver of such term,
condition, right or privilege. No course of dealing or failure of any Party to strictly enforce any term,
right, or condition of this Agreement in any instance shall be construed as a general waiver or
relinquishment of such term, right or condition.

36.1 The Parties will work cooperatively to implement this Agreement. The Parties will exchange
appropriate information (for example, maintenance contact numbers, network information, information
required to comply with law enforcement and other security agencies of the Government, escalation
processes, etc.) to achieve this desired result.

3.3 In the event the AT&T-13STATE fails to meet a CHC Service commitment for reasons within the control of
AT&T-13STATE, AT&T will not charge CLEC a CHC Service charge. However, in the event AT&T misses a
CHC Service commitment due to CLEC, its agent or end user reasons, the Coordinated Hot Cut (CHC) Service
charge will still apply. For example, if CLEC requests any change to an order with CHC Service including, but
not limited to, AT&T-13STATE’s inability to gain access to CLEC’s end user’s premises, or CLEC/end user is
not ready to proceed with the order, the CHC charge will apply and AT&T-13STATE is no longer obligated to
ensure a CHC is on that order.
1 AT&T-13STATE will not charge the additional labor rate in a particular state in the AT&T MIDWEST 5-STATE region until the effective non-
recurring dockets: IL - 98-0396, IN - Cause 40611-S1, MI - U-11831, OH - 96-922-TP-UNC, and WI - 6720-TI-120, are superceded by that state’s
commission order approving new non-recurring Lawful UNE rates.

power, grounding, environmental, and physical design requirements. These documents can be
referenced via https://clec.att.com/clec.
2.26 Technically Feasible - A collocation arrangement is technically feasible if, in accordance with either
national standards or industry practice, there is no significant technical impediment to its establishment.
Technical impediment shall be determined consistent with the definition of technically feasible in 47 CFR
Section 51.5 to the extent that definition may be effective at the time of such determination. A rebuttable
presumption that a collocation arrangement is technically feasible shall arise if the arrangement has been
deployed by any incumbent local exchange carrier in the country.
2.27 Telecommunications Infrastructure Space - Denotes the square footage or linear footage of space,
including common areas, used to house telecommunications infrastructure equipment necessary to
support collocation space used for interconnection with or access to UNEs of AT&T-13STATE’s network.

void AT&T-13STATE’s warranty on proximate.
3. GENERAL
3.1 Certification
3.1.1 The Collocator requesting Physical Collocation is responsible for obtaining any necessary
certifications or approvals from the state utility commission prior to provisioning of
telecommunications service by using the Physical Collocation space. AT&T-13STATE shall not
refuse to process an application for collocation space and shall not refuse to provision the
collocation space submitted by a telecommunications carrier while that telecommunications
carrier’s state certification is pending or prior to a final approved interconnection agreement.
3.2 The rates and charges in this Appendix are applicable only for Physical Collocation arrangements in
Eligible Structures as defined in Section 2 of this Appendix. AT&T-13STATE allocates the charges for
space preparation and security charges on a prorated basis so the first Collocator in a premises will not
be responsible for the entire cost of site preparation. However, ancillary charges for unique Collocator
requests for collocation options directly attributable to the requesting Collocator will not be prorated.
Examples include power arrangements and POT bay-related options.
3.3 Hazardous Waste and Materials
3.3.1 The Collocator and its vendors shall adhere to all federal, state and local regulations regarding
hazardous material/waste. In addition, the telecommunications carrier’s Installation Supplier shall
adhere to all AT&T-13STATE requirements. The Installation Supplier shall coordinate with the
AT&T-13STATE representative before any activity relating to hazardous material/waste is started.

representatives. The Collocator shall take precautions to avoid harm to personnel, equipment, and
building (e.g., cutting installed threaded rod) of AT&T-13STATE or other telecommunications
carriers. The Collocator shall immediately report to the AT&T-13STATE representative any
accident, outside agency inspection or hazardous condition, such as any accident or injury that
occurs to employees or subcontractors of the Collocator while on AT&T-13STATE premises or any
OSHA inspection or citations issued to the Collocator while on AT&T-13STATE premises. (Refer
to Interconnector’s Guide for Collocation for further details).
3.5 Parking at Eligible Structures will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis if there is no commercial
parking or curbside parking available within a reasonable radius of the Eligible Structure. AT&T-
13STATE will rent parking spaces to Collocator on a first-come, first-served basis if such space is
available. Collocator may not park in spaces that are reserved for AT&T-13STATE vehicles and which
are designated as reserved. AT&T-13STATE shall not unreasonably reserve for its own use all parking
at the Eligible Structure.
3.6 Collocator shall be allowed to have reasonable use of and access to loading docks. Collocator and
AT&T-13STATE are required to follow all posted traffic and AT&T-13STATE signs and follow all
applicable parking and traffic laws and ordinances.
3.7 Collocator’s Equipment and Facilities
3.7.1 The Collocator is solely responsible for the design, engineering, testing, performance and
maintenance of the telecommunications equipment and facilities used in the Dedicated Space.
The Collocator will be responsible for servicing, supplying, repairing, installing and maintaining the
following within the Dedicated Space or optional Point of Termination (POT) frame located in the
common area:
3.7.1.1 its fiber optic cable(s) or other permitted transmission media as specified in Section 9.1;
3.7.1.2 its equipment;
3.7.1.3 required point of termination cross connects in the Dedicated Space or the optional POT
Frame/Cabinet located in the Common Area;
3.7.1.4 POT frame maintenance, including replacement power fuses and circuit breaker
restoration, to the extent that such fuses and circuit breakers are within the Dedicated
Space or in the optional POT Frame/Cabinet located in the Common Area and accessible
by the Collocator and only if and as required; and
3.7.1.5 the connection cable and associated equipment which may be required within the

when there is one benefiting Collocator, one-third when there are two (2), and so on.
3.8.4 Should AT&T-13STATE be the sole beneficiary of an upgrade (e.g., an upgrade would have had to
be made regardless of whether or not a Collocator was collocated in the CO), AT&T-13STATE
shall absorb all of the costs related to such an upgrade.
3.9 The rates and charges set forth herein are for Physical Collocation arrangements, while charges for
interconnection and access to UNEs are as set forth in the respective sections of this Appendix.
4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

4.5 Self-Insured
4.5.1 Self-insurance in lieu of the insurance requirements listed preceding shall be permitted if the
Collocator 1) has a tangible net worth of fifty (50) million dollars or greater, and 2) files a financial
statement annually with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or having a financial
strength rating of 4A or 5A assigned by Dun & Bradstreet. The ability to self-insure shall continue
so long as the Collocator meets all of the requirements of this Section. If the Collocator
subsequently no longer satisfies this Section 4.5.1, Coverage Requirements, shall immediately
apply.
5. INDEMNIFICATION OF AT&T-13STATE
5.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Indemnification is governed by the General Terms and Conditions of
this Agreement.
5.2 Casualty Loss
5.2.1 Damage to Dedicated Space
5.2.1.1 If the Dedicated Space is damaged by fire or other casualty that is not the result of the
Collocator’s actions or those of a Third Party as hereinafter described, and (1) the
Dedicated Space is not rendered untenantable in whole or in part, AT&T-13STATE shall
repair the same at its expense (as hereafter limited) and the monthly charge shall not be
abated, or (2) the Dedicated Space is rendered untenantable in whole or in part and such
damage or destruction can be repaired within ninety (90) business days, AT&T-13STATE
has the option to repair the Dedicated Space at its expense (as hereafter limited) and the
monthly charges shall be proportionately abated while the Collocator was deprived of the
use. If the Dedicated Space cannot be repaired within ninety (90) business days, or AT&T-
13STATE opts not to rebuild, then AT&T-13STATE shall notify the Collocator within thirty
(30) business days following such occurrence that the Collocator’s use of the Dedicated
Space will terminate as of the date of such damage. Upon the Collocator’s election,
AT&T-13STATE must provide to the Collocator, a comparable substitute collocation
arrangement at another mutually agreeable location at the applicable non-recurring
charges for that arrangement and location.
5.2.1.2 Any obligation on the part of AT&T-13STATE to repair the Dedicated Space shall be
limited to repairing, restoring and rebuilding the Dedicated Space as prepared for the
Collocator by AT&T-13STATE.
5.2.2 Damage to Eligible Structure
5.2.2.1 In the event that the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located shall be so
damaged by fire or other casualty that closing, demolition or substantial alteration or
reconstruction thereof shall, in AT&T-13STATE’s opinion be advisable, then,
notwithstanding that the Dedicated Space may be unaffected thereby, AT&T-13STATE, at
its option, may terminate services provided via this Appendix by giving the Collocator ten
(10) business days prior written notice within thirty (30) business days following the date of
such occurrence, if at all possible.
6. SECURITY
6.1 AT&T-13STATE may impose the following reasonable security measures on Collocator to assist in
protecting its network and equipment from harm. AT&T-13STATE may impose security arrangements as
stringent as the security arrangements AT&T-13STATE maintains at its own Eligible Structures either for
its own employees or for authorized contractors. To the extent security arrangements are more stringent
for one group than the other, AT&T-13STATE may impose the more stringent requirements. Stated
differently, the incumbent will not impose discriminatory security requirements that result in increased
collocation costs without the concomitant benefit of providing necessary protection of the incumbent’s
Page 76 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE

equipment. AT&T-13STATE will not use any information collected in the course of implementing or
operating security arrangements for any marketing or other purpose in aid of competing with Collocator.
6.1.1 Collocator will conduct background checks of its personnel and technicians who will have access to
the collocation space. Such background checks will include but are not to be limited to criminal
background checks for offenses involving theft or damage to property, and a check of FBI listings
of known or suspected terrorists.
6.1.1.1 Collocator technicians will be security-qualified by the Collocator and will be required to be
knowledgeable of AT&T-13STATE security standards. Collocator personnel and
technicians will undergo the same level of security training or its equivalent that AT&T-
13STATE’s own employees and authorized contractors must undergo. AT&T-13STATE
will not, however, require Collocator to receive security training from AT&T-13STATE, but
will provide information to Collocator on the specific type of training required.
6.1.1.2 Collocator can then provide its employees with its own security training. Qualification
program and security training details shall be included in AT&T-13STATE’s Technical
Publications via https://clec.att.com/clec.
6.1.1.3 Collocator and AT&T-13STATE will each establish disciplinary procedures up to and
including dismissal or denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other property of
AT&T-13STATE for certain specified actions that damage, or place the equipment,
facilities, or the network or personnel of the Collocator or AT&T-13STATE in jeopardy.
The following are actions that could damage or place the Eligible Structure, or the network
or the personnel of the Collocator or AT&T-13STATE in jeopardy and may justify
disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or the denial of access to the Eligible
Structure and other AT&T-13STATE property:
6.1.1.3.1 Theft or destruction of AT&T-13STATE’s or Collocator’s property;
6.1.1.3.2 Use/sale or attempted use/sale of alcohol or illegal drugs on AT&T-13STATE
property;
6.1.1.3.3 Threats or violent acts against other persons on AT&T-13STATE property;
6.1.1.3.4 Knowing violations of any local, state or federal law on AT&T-13STATE property;
6.1.1.3.5 Permitting unauthorized persons access to AT&T-13STATE or Collocator’s
equipment on AT&T-13STATE property; and
6.1.1.3.6 Carrying a weapon on AT&T-13STATE property.
In addition, Collocator and AT&T-13STATE will take appropriate disciplinary steps as
determined by each Party to address any violations reported by AT&T-13STATE or the
Collocator of AT&T-13STATE’s policies and practices on security, safety, network
reliability, and business conduct as defined in AT&T-13STATE’s Interconnector’s
Collocation Services Handbook https://clec.att.com/clec for Physical Collocation in AT&T-
13STATE, provided the Handbook and any and all updates to it are timely provided to
Collocator at no charge.
6.1.1.4 Collocator will provide indemnification as set forth in Section 5 of this Appendix and
insurance as set forth in Section 4.4 of this Appendix to cover any damages caused by the
Collocator’s technicians at a level commensurate with the indemnification and insurance
provided by AT&T-13STATE-authorized contractors with equivalent access. The
indemnification provisions and requirements are reciprocal to AT&T-13STATE as well.
6.1.1.5 AT&T-13STATE may use reasonable security measures to protect its equipment. In the
event AT&T-13STATE elects to erect an interior security partition in a given Eligible
Structure to separate its equipment, AT&T-13STATE may recover the costs of the partition
in lieu of the costs of other reasonable security measures if the partition costs are lower
than the costs of any other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. In no
event shall a Collocator be required to pay for both an interior security partition to separate

AT&T-13STATE’s equipment in an Eligible Structure and any other reasonable security
measure for such Eligible Structure.
6.1.1.5.1 AT&T-13STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own
equipment shall not interfere with a telecommunications carrier’s access to its
equipment, including equipment collocated directly adjacent to AT&T-13STATE’s
equipment. AT&T-13STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around
its own equipment shall not impede a telecommunications carrier’s ability to
collocate within AT&T-13STATE’s space. To the extent that AT&T-13STATE is
required to install additional security measures within its interior security partition
because a telecommunications carrier has access to its own equipment within the
area, such security measures shall be constructed and maintained at AT&T-
13STATE’s expense.
6.1.1.5.2 AT&T-13STATE’s enclosure of its own equipment will not be a basis for a claim
that space is Legitimately Exhausted, nor will it be a basis for a claim that Active
Collocation Space is exhausted.
6.1.1.5.3 AT&T-13STATE’s enclosure of its own equipment will not unreasonably increase
a telecommunications carrier’s cost nor shall it result in duplicative security costs.
The cost of an interior security partition around AT&T-13STATE’s equipment
cannot include any embedded costs of any other security measures for the
Eligible Structure.
6.1.1.5.4 If AT&T-13STATE chooses to enclose its own equipment, AT&T-13STATE will
be entitled to recover the cost of the cage only to the extent that the price of such
construction is lower than that of other reasonable security measures.
6.1.1.5.5 AT&T-13STATE has the burden to demonstrate that the cost of security
measures alternative to its partitioning of its own equipment is higher than the cost
of enclosing its own equipment. If AT&T-13STATE cannot prove that other
reasonable security methods cost more than an interior security partition around
AT&T-13STATE’s equipment, AT&T-13STATE cannot elect to erect an interior
security partition in a given Eligible Structure to separate its equipment and then
recover the cost from Collocators.
6.1.1.5.6 If AT&T-13STATE elects to erect an interior security partition and recover the
cost, it must demonstrate to the Collocator that other reasonable security methods
cost more than an interior security partition around AT&T-13STATE’s equipment
at the time the price quote is given.
6.1.1.6 Collocator will have access to its physically collocated equipment twenty-four (24) hours a
day, seven (7) days a week, without a security escort. AT&T-13STATE will not delay a
Collocator’s entry into an Eligible Structure or access to its collocated equipment. AT&T-
13STATE will provide Collocator with reasonable access to restroom facilities and parking.
Collocator will also have reasonable access to Collocator’s assigned space during
construction.
7. DEDICATED SPACE
7.1 Contact Numbers
7.1.1 AT&T-13STATE is responsible for providing the Collocator personnel a contact number for AT&T-
13STATE technical personnel who are readily accessible twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7)
days a week. In addition, for all activities requiring verbal and written notification per this Appendix,
the Parties will provide the contact numbers included in the application process. Notwithstanding
the requirements for contact numbers, the Collocator will have access to its collocated equipment
in the Eligible Structure twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week and AT&T-13STATE
will not delay a Collocator’s entry into an Eligible Structure.

Collocator technical personnel who are readily accessible twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7)
days a week AT&T-13STATE. In addition, for all activities requiring verbal and written notification
per this Appendix, the Parties will provide the contact numbers included in the application process.
7.2 Right-to-Use; Multiple Dedicated Spaces
7.2.1 In accordance with this Appendix, AT&T-13STATE grants to the Collocator the right to use a
Dedicated Space. Each Dedicated Space within an Eligible Structure will be considered a single
Dedicated Space for the application of rates according to this Appendix.
7.3 Trouble Status Reports
7.3.1 AT&T-13STATE and the Collocator are responsible for making best efforts to provide prompt
verbal notification to each other of significant outages or operations problems which could impact
or degrade AT&T-13STATE or the Collocator’s network, switches or services, with an estimated
clearing time to restore service. In addition, AT&T-13STATE and the Collocator will provide written
notification within twenty-four (24) hours to each other. When trouble has been identified, AT&T-
13STATE or the Collocator is responsible for providing trouble status reports, consistent with this
Appendix, when requested by AT&T-13STATE or the Collocator.
7.4 Service Coordination
7.4.1 AT&T-13STATE is responsible for coordinating with the Collocator to ensure that services are
installed in accordance with the service request.
7.5 Active/Inactive Space Determination
7.5.1 In its notification regarding whether its request for collocation has been granted or denied AT&T-
13STATE shall inform the Collocator if the space available for the requested collocation space will
be Active Collocation or Inactive Space, as those terms are defined in Section 2 of this Appendix.
If the Collocator’s space is placed in Inactive Space, then the notification shall also include
rationale for placing the requested space in such category, including all power, switching, and other
factors used in making the determination.
7.5.2 In the event that the Collocator disputes the AT&T-13STATE placement of the space into Inactive
Space, then the Collocator may request a tour of the Eligible Structure to verify the Active/Inactive
space availability. AT&T-13STATE will provide all relevant documentation to the Collocator agent
supporting its placement of Collocator’s requested collocation arrangement in Inactive Space,
subject to executing a non-disclosure agreement at the time of the inspection tour. The request
shall be submitted to the AT&T-13STATE-designated representative in writing within five (5)
business days of notification to Collocator. If the Collocator fails to submit the written request
within the eligible time frame, the option for an inspection tour is forfeited. The inspection tour will
be scheduled within three (3) business days of receipt of the request for a tour. Any requested tour
shall be scheduled to take place no later than seven (7) business days following the request for the
inspection tour. At the Collocator’s request, the request for inspection tour for determination of
Active/Inactive space may be conducted concurrently with a tour involving space availability
disputes, as provided in this Appendix, thereby modifying the time frame requirements in this
paragraph.
7.5.3 The AT&T-13STATE representative will escort one (1) Collocator agent on the inspection tour. If
the Collocator agent believes, based on the inspection tour of the Eligible Structure that the
placement of the collocation space in Inactive Space is unsupportable, the Collocator agent shall
promptly advise AT&T-13STATE orally and in writing within five (5) business days of the
completion of the inspection tour. The Collocator may dispute the AT&T-13STATE findings
through the Dispute Resolution Process outlined herein, and the burden of proof shall be on AT&T-
13STATE to justify the basis for placement of the Collocator’s space in Inactive Space. If the
Collocator fails to submit the written request within the eligible time frame, it will be assumed that
no dispute exists.

7.6 Types of Available Physical Collocation Arrangements
7.6.1 AT&T-13STATE will make each of the arrangements outlined below available within its Eligible
Structures in accordance with this Appendix so that Collocator will have a variety of collocation
options from which to choose:
7.6.1.1 Caged Physical Collocation - The Caged Collocation option provides the Collocator with an
individual enclosure (not including a top). This enclosure is an area designated by AT&T-
13STATE within an Eligible Structure to be used by the Collocator for the sole purpose of
installing, maintaining and operating the Collocator-provided equipment for the purpose of
interconnection and access to UNEs. Accordingly, AT&T-13STATE will not provide
Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-13STATE’s Main Distribution
Frame (MDF), with the exception of the AT&T-13STATE’s Approved Vendor.
7.6.1.2 AT&T-13STATE will provide floor space, floor space site conditioning, cage common
systems materials, cage preparation, and safety and security charges in increments of one
(1) square foot. For this reason, Collocator will be able to order space and a cage
enclosure in amounts as small as that sufficient to house and maintain a single rack or bay
of equipment, (i.e., fifty (50) square feet of caged space) and will ensure that the first
Collocator in a AT&T-13STATE premises will not be responsible for the entire cost of site
preparation and security.
7.6.1.2.1 The Collocator must comply with all methods, procedures and guidelines followed
by AT&T-13STATE in constructing such an arrangement. The Collocator may
provide a cage enclosure (which shall not include a top), cable rack and support
structure inside the cage, lighting, receptacles, cage grounding, cage sign and
door key set. In addition, terms and conditions for contractors performing cage
construction activities as set forth in Section 21 following will apply. If the
Collocator elects to install or requests that AT&T-13STATE provide and install a
point of termination (POT) frame in the dedicated collocation area rather than
inside its cage.
7.6.1.3 Caged Shared Collocation - AT&T-13STATE will provide Caged Shared Collocation as set
forth in Section 11 following, “Use by Other Local Service Providers”. Two (2) or more
Collocators may initially apply at the same time to share a Caged Collocation space as set
forth in Section 11.1 following. Charges to each Collocator will be based upon the
percentage of total space utilized by each Collocator. Accordingly, AT&T-13STATE will
not provide Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-13STATE’s Main
Distribution Frame (MDF), with the exception of the AT&T-13STATE’s Approved Vendor.
7.6.1.4 Cageless Collocation - AT&T-13STATE will provide Cageless Collocation in any
collocation space that is supported by the existing telecommunications infrastructure
(Active Collocation Space), or in the event that all such space is exhausted or completely
occupied, will provide in any collocation space that requires additional telecommunications
infrastructure (Inactive Space), as further defined in Section 2 of this Appendix. Under this
arrangement, AT&T-13STATE will provide space in single bay increments, including
available space adjacent to or next to AT&T-13STATE’s equipment. Collocator will have
direct access to its equipment twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week without
need for a security escort AT&T-13STATE. AT&T-13STATE will not require Collocator to
use an intermediate interconnection arrangement (i.e., POT frame). AT&T-13STATE may
take reasonable steps to protect its own equipment as provided in Section 6 of this
Appendix. Accordingly, AT&T-13STATE will not provide Collocator’s personnel or agents
with direct access to AT&T-13STATE’s Main Distribution Frame (MDF), with the exception
of the AT&T-13STATE Approved Tier 1 Vendor.
7.6.1.5 Adjacent On-Site Space Collocation – Where Physical Collocation space within AT&T-
13STATE Eligible Structure is Legitimately Exhausted, as that term is defined in Section 2
Page 80 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE

of this Appendix, AT&T-13STATE will permit Collocator to physically collocate on AT&T-
13STATE’s property in adjacent Controlled Environmental Vaults (CEV), Huts, Cabinets, or
similar structures that AT&T-13STATE uses to house telecommunication equipment, to the
extent technically feasible. AT&T-13STATE and telecommunications carrier will mutually
agree on the location of the designated space on AT&T-13STATE premises where the
Adjacent Structure will be placed. AT&T-13STATE will not unreasonably withhold
agreement as to the site desired by Collocator. Safety and maintenance requirements,
zoning and other state and local regulations are all reasonable grounds to withhold
agreement as to the site desired by the Collocator. AT&T-13STATE will offer the following
increments of power to the Adjacent Structure: AT&T-13STATE will provide a standard
offering of one-hundred (100) amps of AC power to the Adjacent Structure when Central
Office Switchboard AC capacity exists. AT&T-13STATE will provide DC power within two
(2) cable options that allow increments of 2-100 (100A feed and 100B feed) Amp Power
Feeds, 2-200 (200A feed and 200B feed) Amp Power Feeds, 2-300 (300A feed and 300B
feed) Amp Power Feeds, and 2-400 (400A feed and 400B feed) Amp Power Feeds to the
Adjacent Structure from the Central Office Power source. At its option, the Collocator may
choose to provide its own AC and DC power to the Adjacent Structure. AT&T-13STATE
will provide Physical Collocation services to such Adjacent Structures, subject to the same
requirements as other collocation arrangements in this Appendix. AT&T-13STATE shall
permit Collocator to place its own equipment, including, but not limited to, copper cables,
coaxial cables, fiber cables and telecommunications equipment, in adjacent facilities
constructed by either AT&T-13STATE or the Collocator. Accordingly, AT&T-13STATE will
not provide Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-13STATE’s Main
Distribution Frame (MDF), with the exception of the AT&T-13STATE’s Approved Tier 1
Vendor.
7.6.1.5.1 Collocator shall be responsible for securing all required licenses and permits, the
required site preparations and shall further retain responsibility for securing and/or
constructing the Adjacent Structure and any building and site maintenance
associated with the placement of such Adjacent Structure.
7.6.1.5.2 Regeneration is required for collocation in an Adjacent Structure if the cabling
distance between the Collocator’s POT bay or termination point located in an
adjacent structure and AT&T-13STATE’s cross-connect bay exceeds American
National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) limitations. Regeneration is not required
in any other circumstances except where the Collocator specifically requests
regeneration. Required regeneration and Collocator-requested regeneration will
be provided at the Collocator’s expense.
7.6.1.6 Adjacent Off-Site Arrangement - Where Physical Collocation space within AT&T-13STATE
Eligible Structure is Legitimately Exhausted, and Collocator’s Adjacent On-site space is not
within fifty feet (50 ft.) of the Eligible Structure’s outside perimeter wall, the Collocator has
the option and AT&T-13STATE shall permit an Adjacent Structure Off-site Arrangement, to
the extent technically feasible.
7.6.1.6.1 The Adjacent Off-site Arrangement is available if the Collocator’s site is located on
a property that is contiguous to or within one (1) standard city block of the AT&T-
13STATE Central Office or Eligible Structure.
7.6.1.6.2 Such arrangement shall be used for interconnection and access to UNEs.
7.6.1.6.3 When the Collocator elects to utilize an Adjacent Off-site Arrangement, the
Collocator shall provide both the AC and DC power required to operate such
facility. The Collocator may provide its own facilities to AT&T-13STATE’s
premises or to a mutually agreeable meet point from its Adjacent Off-site location
for interconnection purposes. The Collocator may subscribe to facilities available
in the UNE rate schedule of the Collocator’s Agreement.

7.6.1.6.4 At the time the Collocator requests this arrangement, the Collocator must provide
information as to the location of the Adjacent Off-site facility, the proposed method
of interconnection, and the time frame needed to complete provisioning of the
arrangement. AT&T-13STATE shall provide a response to Collocator within ten
(10) days of receipt of the application, including a price quote, provisioning
interval, and confirmation of the manner in which the Adjacent Off-site Facility will
be interconnected with AT&T-13STATE’s facilities. AT&T-13STATE shall make
best efforts to meet the time intervals requested by Collocator and, if it cannot
meet the Collocator’s proposed deadline, shall provide detailed reasons, as well
as proposed provisioning intervals.
7.6.1.7 In the event that interior space in an Eligible Structure becomes available, AT&T-13STATE
will provide the option to the Collocator to relocate its equipment from an Adjacent On-site
or an Adjacent Off-site Facility into the interior space. In the event the Collocator chooses
to relocate its equipment into the interior space, appropriate charges applicable for
collocation within the Eligible Structure will apply.
7.6.1.8 AT&T-13STATE will provide other collocation arrangements that have been demonstrated
to be technically feasible. Deployment by any Incumbent LEC of a collocation
arrangement gives rise to a rebuttable presumption in favor of a telecommunications
carrier seeking collocation in AT&T-13STATE’s Eligible Structures that such an
arrangement is technically feasible.
7.7 Construction Inspections
7.7.1 During the construction of all forms of Physical Collocation space required under this Appendix,
Collocator shall be permitted up to four (4) inspections during the construction in an Eligible
Structure during normal business hours with a minimum of two (2) hours advance notification. If
the construction interval is extended beyond the agreed upon interval, Collocator will be granted
two (2) additional visits per thirty (30) day extension. Requests for construction inspections shall
be given to the contact number as specified in this Appendix.
7.7.2 Collocator may request that one (1) of its four (4) construction visits take place as an initial walk
through and inspection. Within twenty (20) calendar days or mutually agreed upon time, from
AT&T-13STATE’s receipt of the confirmatory response in writing for an initial collocation
arrangement to continue construction on the Physical Collocation job requested along with the fifty
percent (50%) payment of non-recurring charges (unless payment was received with application),
Network Sales Support and/or appropriate departments will schedule a walk through visit with the
telecommunications carrier and/or vendor to provide floor plans of space and the preliminary route
design for the interconnection and power cabling.
7.8 Construction Notification
7.8.1 AT&T-13STATE will notify the Collocator prior to the scheduled start dates of all major construction
activities (including power additions or modifications) in the general area of the Collocator’s
Dedicated Space with potential to disrupt the Collocator’s services. AT&T-13STATE will provide
such notification to the Collocator at least twenty (20) business days before the scheduled start
date of such major construction activity. AT&T-13STATE will inform the Collocator as soon as
practicable by telephone of all emergency-related activities that AT&T-13STATE or its
subcontractors are performing in the general area of the Collocator’s Dedicated Space, or in the
general area of the AC and DC power plants which support the Collocator’s equipment. If possible,
notification of any emergency-related activity will be made immediately prior to the start of the
activity so that the Collocator may take reasonable actions necessary to protect the Collocator’s
Dedicated Space.

8. ORDERING, PROVISIONING AND BILLING
8.1 Space Availability Report
8.1.1 So that it may make informed decisions regarding in which AT&T-13STATE eligible structures it
wishes to collocate, a Telecommunications Carrier may request a Space Availability report prior to
its application for Collocation Space within AT&T-13STATE’s eligible structures. The report is
available on CLEC Online. Fees for such report are as shown in Collocation Rate Summary.
8.1.2 AT&T-13STATE will submit to a requesting Telecommunications Carrier a report indicating AT&T-
13STATE’s available collocation space in a particular AT&T-13STATE Eligible Structure upon
request AT&T-13STATE. This report will specify the amount of collocation space available at each
requested Eligible Structure, the number of Collocators, and any modifications in the use of the
space since the last report. The report will also include measures that AT&T-13STATE is taking to
make additional space available for collocation. The intervals for delivering the reports are as
follows:
Number of Report Requests By One Collocator Report Delivery Interval
1 - 5 10 Calendar Days
6 - 10 15 Calendar Days
11 - 15 20 Calendar Days
16 – 20 25 Calendar Days
8.1.3 Should the Collocator submit twenty-one (21) or more report requests within five (5) business days,
the report delivery interval will be increased by five (5) business days for every five (5) additional
report requests or fraction thereof.
8.1.4 Space Unavailability Determination and Resolution
8.1.4.1 AT&T-13STATE shall notify the Collocator in writing as to whether its request for Physical
Collocation has been granted or denied within ten (10) calendar days of submission of the
completed application. If AT&T needs more time to continue analyzing certain aspects of
the request, AT&T-13STATE’s 10 calendar day notice shall be limited to addressing
whether or not AT&T has the requested, or designated alternative, amount of appropriate
collocation space.
8.1.4.2 In responding to an application request if space is not available, AT&T-13STATE will notify
the Collocator that its application for Dedicated Space is denied due to the lack of space
within ten (10) calendar days of AT&T-13STATE's receipt of a completed application.
8.1.4.3 The notification will include a possible future space relief date, if applicable. At that time,
any non-recurring charges collected with the application, including the Planning Fee, will
be returned to the Collocator.
8.1.4.4 AT&T-13STATE will file a notice that the Collocator’s request was denied with the state
Commission as appropriate. In the event of a denial, AT&T-13STATE will concurrently
submit to both the appropriate Commission and the Collocator, in support of its denial,
provided under seal and subject to proprietary protections: Central Office common
language identifier, where applicable, the identity of the requesting Collocator, including
amount of space requested by the Collocator, the total amount of space at the premises,
floor plan documentation as provided for in the Space Availability Determination section of
the Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook https://clec.att.com/clec, identification
of switch turnaround plans and other equipment removal plans and timelines, if any,
Central Office rearrangement/expansion plans, if any, and description of other plans, if any,
that may relieve space exhaustion.
8.1.4.5 In the event AT&T-13STATE denies a Collocator’s request and the Collocator disputes the
denial, the Collocator may request a tour of the Eligible Structure to verify space availability
or the lack thereof. The request shall be submitted to AT&T-13STATE’s designated
Page 83 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE

representative in writing. The inspection tour shall be scheduled within five (5) business
days of receipt of the written request for a tour and the tour shall be conducted within ten
(10) calendar days of the request or some other mutually agreed on date.
8.1.4.6 Prior to the inspection tour, a “Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement” shall be signed by
the designated AT&T-13STATE representative and the designated agent for the
Collocator, who will participate in the tour.
8.1.4.7 AT&T-13STATE will provide all relevant documentation to the Collocator agent including
blueprints and plans for future facility expansions or enhancements, subject to executing
the non-disclosure agreement. AT&T-13STATE’s representative will accompany and
supervise the Collocator agent on the inspection tour.
8.1.4.8 If the Collocator agent believes, based on the inspection tour of the Eligible Structure
facilities, that the denial of Physical Collocation space is insupportable, the Collocator
agent shall promptly so advise AT&T-13STATE. The Collocator and AT&T-13STATE
shall then each concurrently prepare a report detailing its own findings of the inspection
tour. The Collocator and AT&T-13STATE reports shall be concurrently served on each
other and submitted to the appropriate Commission no later than forty-five (45) calendar
days following the filing of the request for space. The burden of proof shall be on AT&T-
13STATE to justify the basis for any denial of collocation requests.
8.1.4.9 Legitimately Exhausted. Before AT&T-13STATE may make a determination that space
in an Eligible Structure is legitimately exhausted, AT&T-13STATE must have removed all
unused obsolete equipment from the Eligible Structure and made such space available for
collocation; however, removal of the equipment shall not cause a delay in AT&T-
13STATE’s response to a Collocator’s application or in provisioning collocation
arrangements. The determination of exhaustion is subject to dispute resolution as
provided in Section 8.7 of this Appendix. In making this determination, AT&T-13STATE
may reserve space for transport equipment for current year plus two (2) years.
Additionally, AT&T-13STATE may not reserve space for equipment for itself, or advanced
or interLATA services affiliates or other affiliates of AT&T-13STATE or for future use by
AT&T-13STATE or its affiliates under conditions that are more favorable than those that
apply to other telecommunications carriers seeking to reserve collocation space for their
own use. AT&T-13STATE may reserve space for Switching, Power, Main Distribution
Frame (MDF), and Digital Cross Connect System (DCS) up to anticipated customer growth
over a ten (10)-year life expectancy of the ultimate footprint of the equipment.
8.1.5 Application Quotation Interval for Physical Collocation
8.1.5.1 AT&T-13STATE will provide Physical Collocation arrangements in Eligible Structures on a
“first-come, first-served” basis. To apply for a Dedicated Space in a particular Eligible
Structure, the Collocator will provide a completed Physical Collocation application through
the Collocation Application Web Portal or via a paper application form found in AT&T-
13STATE’s Interconnector's Collocation Services Handbook (https://clec.att.com/clec) for
Physical Collocation in AT&T-13STATE and will pay an initial Planning Fee (see
Collocation Rate Summary.) Dedicated Space is not reserved until the quotation is
accepted by the Collocator and appropriate fees paid to AT&T-13STATE.
8.1.5.1.1 A Collocator wishing AT&T-13STATE to consider multiple methods for collocation
in an Eligible Structure on a single application will need to include in each
application a prioritized list of its preferred methods of collocating, e.g., caged,
shared, cageless, or other, as well as adequate information, (e.g., specific layout
requirements, cage size, number of bays, requirements relative to adjacent bays,
etc.) for AT&T-13STATE to process the application for each of the preferred
methods. If a Collocator provides adequate information and its preferences with
its application, AT&T-13STATE would not require an additional application, nor
Page 84 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 18 OF 55
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
051007
would the Collocator be required to restart the quotation interval should its first
choice not be available in an Eligible Structure. If Collocator only wishes AT&T-
13STATE to consider one collocation method, it need not provide preferences
and associated specific information for multiple methods. However, if AT&T-
13STATE is unable to provide the Collocator’s requested collocation method due
to space constraints the application will be denied and the initial Planning Fee will
be returned. If the Collocator determines the alternative method of collocation
meets their needs, the Collocator will be required to submit a new collocation
application and pay the initial Planning Fee. Upon receipt of the Collocator’s
application and initial Planning Fee payment, AT&T-13STATE will begin
development of the quotation. AT&T-13STATE will advise the Collocator in
writing of any known deficiencies in its collocation application within ten (10)
calendar days (unless multiple applications are received; Section 8.1.5.3 will apply
where multiple applications are received). AT&T-13STATE will allow the
Collocator to retain its place in the collocation queue so long as the Collocator
cures the deficiencies and resubmits the application within ten (10) calendar days
after being advised of the deficiencies.
8.1.5.2 In responding to an application request, if space is available and all other collocation
requirements are met, AT&T-13STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request for
Physical Collocation is granted, and confirm the applicable non-recurring and recurring
rates, and the estimated provisioning interval. AT&T-13STATE will not select for
Collocator the type of Physical Collocation to be ordered.
8.1.5.2.1 The Collocator has sixty-five (65) calendar days after request for physical
collocation is granted to remit a signed confirmation form along with a check for
the Planning Fee and fifty percent (50%) of all the applicable non-recurring
charges. After sixty-five (65) calendar days, a new application and Planning Fee
are required. Space is allocated on a “first come-first served” basis.
8.1.5.3 Should multiple applications be submitted by a Collocator within a ten (10) calendar day
period, the following quotation intervals will apply:
Number of Applications by one Collocator Quotation Interval
1 - 5 10 calendar days
6 - 10 15 calendar days
11 - 15 20 calendar days
16 - 20 25 calendar days
8.1.5.4 Should the Collocator submit twenty-one (21) or more applications within ten (10) calendar
days, the response interval will be increased by five (5) business days for every five (5)
additional applications or fraction thereof.
8.1.6 Revisions
8.1.6.1 All revisions to an initial request for a Physical Collocation arrangement submitted by the
Collocator must be in writing via a new application form.
8.1.6.2 Any major revision to an application will be treated as a new application. A new interval for
the Physical Collocation arrangement will be established. A major revision includes, but is
not limited to: adding telecommunications equipment that requires additional electrical
power; changes in the configuration of the cage; an addition of interconnection cabling; an
increase of ten percent (10%) or more of the square footage of the cage area requested;
and adding design and engineering requirements above those which AT&T-13STATE
normally deploys and practices (i.e., redundancy of certain mechanical and electrical
systems). The Collocator will be required to pay an additional Planning Fee and applicable
non-recurring fees before construction resumes under new intervals.

051007
8.1.6.3 Minor revisions will not require that a new interval be established. Examples of minor
revisions include: adding bays of equipment that do not significantly impact the
existing/proposed electrical systems; adding light fixtures and outlets which do not exceed
the capacity of the existing/proposed electrical system; changes in the configuration of the
cage which do not significantly impact the overall design of the space; and adjustments to
the heat release projection which do not cause a change in the proposed/existing
mechanical system. This list is not all-inclusive. No additional Planning Fees shall be
applicable if the revision is minor. All engineering design work that is determined not to be
major is deemed to be minor.
8.2 Installation Intervals
8.2.1 Caged Collocation Installation Intervals
8.2.1.1 Dedicated Space for Caged Physical Collocation and Shared Caged Collocation is not
reserved until the quotation is accepted by the Collocator. If the available space is not
suitable for Central Office equipment (Inactive Space) and must be converted to Active
Collocation Space, thirty (30) calendar days will be added to the provisioning interval to
allow for the conversion process to be completed. If there are additional problems with the
space, AT&T-13STATE shall meet the provisioning interval requirements in the waiver
granted by the FCC unless the state has different provisions.
8.2.1.2 Dedicated Space is not reserved until AT&T-13STATE’s receipt of the confirmatory
response in writing from the Collocator with applicable fees. Where space suitable for
Central Office equipment (Active Collocation Space) is available, AT&T-13STATE will
deliver Caged Physical or Shared Caged Physical Collocation within ninety (90) calendar
days from the completion of the application process.
8.2.1.3 Any material revision to a completed application will be treated as a new application
following revision guidelines set forth in Section 8.1.6.
8.2.2 Cageless Physical Collocation Installation Intervals
8.2.2.1 Dedicated space for Cageless Physical Collocation is not reserved until the quotation is
accepted by the Collocator.
8.2.2.2 Where space suitable for Central Office equipment (Active Central Office Space) is
available and the request includes DC power capacity greater than fifty (50) amps (2-50
amp feeds), AT&T-13STATE will deliver Cageless Physical Collocation within ninety (90)
calendar days from the completion of the application process (when the Collocator has
remitted a signed confirmation form along with a check for fifty-percent (50%) of all
applicable non-recurring charges).
8.2.2.2.1 A shorter interval may apply where Collocator installs all of its own bays (See
Section 21 below). If the available space is not suitable for Central Office
equipment (Inactive Space) and must be converted to Active Collocation Space,
thirty (30) calendar days will be added to the provisioning interval to allow for the
conversion process to be completed. If there are additional problems with the
space, AT&T-13STATE shall meet the provisioning interval requirements in the
waiver granted by the FCC unless the state has different provisions.
8.2.2.2.2 The cageless collocation construction interval ends when roughed in,
unterminated DC power and interconnection cabling is provided to the
Collocator’s collocation area.
8.2.2.3 Any material revision to a completed application will be treated as a new application
following revision guidelines set forth in Section 8.1.6.

8.2.3 Adjacent Space and Other Physical Collocation Arrangement Installation Intervals
8.2.3.1 Installation Intervals for Adjacent Space Collocation and Other Physical Collocation
Arrangements as defined in Sections 7.6.1.5 above will be reasonably related to the
complexity of accommodating the requested arrangement.
8.2.3.2 AT&T-13STATE will complete construction of Cageless Collocation in Eligible Structures
such as CEVs, Huts and Vaults in ninety (90) days from the receipt of the Collocator's
acceptance of the quotation along with a check for fifty percent (50%) of all applicable non-
recurring charges where AT&T-13STATE will be installing all or some of the bays, and the
Collocator is requesting DC power greater than fifty (50) amps per feed. These
construction intervals for Cageless Collocation in Active Collocation Space in a CEV, Hut,
or Cabinet Eligible Structure apply where the Collocator is requesting maximum DC power
of fifty (50) amps (2-50 amp feeds). For Cageless Collocation in Active Collocation Space
in a CEV, Hut, or Cabinet Eligible Structure where a Collocator is requesting DC power
greater than fifty (50) amps per feed, AT&T-13STATE will add thirty (30) calendar days to
the provisioning interval.
8.2.4 Reduced Interval Augments
8.2.4.1 The intervals set forth in this Section 8.2.4 apply only when AT&T-13STATE installs
interconnection and power cabling. AT&T-13STATE will provide a reduced interval for
Collocator with existing Physical Collocation space when it requests the following
interconnection augments for that existing space. The Collocator must submit to AT&T-
13STATE's Collocation Service Center (CSC) a complete and accurate application, along
with a copy of the payment invoice for a subsequent job. For a reduced build-out interval
to apply, this application must include an up-front payment of the non-recurring Planning
Fee from the Collocation Rate Summary and fifty percent (50%) of non-recurring charges.
In addition, the application must include an accurate front equipment view (a.k.a. rack
elevation drawing) specifying bay(s) for the Collocator's point of termination. Applications
received with the up-front payment and meeting the criteria below will not require a quote.
8.2.4.1.1 A sixty (60) calendar day interval will apply only when the Collocator requests any
of the following augments; 1) AT&T-13STATE will perform a cage expansion of
three hundred (300) square feet or less immediately adjacent to Collocator’s
existing cage within the collocation area (where Overhead Iron/Racking exists)
and as long as the collocation area does not have to be reconfigured and does
not involve HVAC work, 2) power cable additions to accommodate greater DC
amperage requests within existing power panels, 3) direct cable pull within the
same collocation area on the same floor between one Collocator and another
Collocator provided the Collocator is interconnected with AT&T-13STATE’s
network, 4) interconnection cable arrangements (where Overhead Iron/Racking
are existing) limited up to and not more than the following quantities; four-hundred
(400) shielded copper cable pairs up to four-hundred (400) feet, one hundred
sixty-eight (168) DS1s, 48 DS3s, and fiber interconnections up to twelve (12) fiber
pairs up to four hundred (400) feet.
8.2.5 Other Augments
8.2.5.1 Other augments such as power requests that exceed current capacity ratings, additional
bay spaces, AT&T-13STATE bays, AT&T-13STATE cable racks and/or cage expansions
within Active Collocation Space different than described above will require the Collocator to
submit an inquiry for quote. The price quote will contain the charges and the construction
interval for that application.
8.2.5.1.1 The construction interval for these other augments will not exceed ninety (90)
days. AT&T-13STATE will work cooperatively with Collocator to negotiate a

mutually agreeable construction interval for other augments not specifically
provided for above.
8.2.5.1.2 The second fifty percent (50%) payment must be received by AT&T-13STATE no
later than one (1) week prior to the scheduled augment completion date. If all
money has been received on the scheduled completion date, the Actual Point of
Termination (APOT) Connections will be provided to the Collocator by AT&T-
13STATE.
8.2.5.1.3 During AT&T-13STATE delivery interval, if engineering design work is complete,
which includes asbestos removal, HVAC installation, filtration, floor loading, floor
preparation, overhead racking placement, and one hundred percent (100%) of the
non-recurring charges have been received by AT&T-13STATE, Collocator and/or
their AT&T-13STATE Approved Tier 1 Vendor (s) may request AT&T-13STATE
to do work in parallel with AT&T-13STATE throughout the remaining delivery
interval. The Collocator must obtain an approved Method of Procedures (MOP)
from AT&T-13STATE and follow AT&T-13STATE’s Technical Publications for
installation of equipment and facilities. Security Card requirements in Section
18.3.6 of this Appendix will apply.
8.3 Cancellation Prior to Due Date
8.3.1 In the event that the Collocator cancels its collocation application after AT&T-13STATE has begun
preparation of the Telecommunications Infrastructure Space and Dedicated Space, but before
AT&T-13STATE has been paid the entire amounts due under this Appendix, then in addition to
other remedies that AT&T-13STATE might have, the Collocator shall be liable in the amount equal
to the non-recoverable costs less estimated net salvage, the total of which is not to exceed the
Preparation Charges. Non-recoverable costs include the non-recoverable cost of equipment and
material ordered, provided or used; the non-recoverable cost of installation and removal, including
the costs of equipment and material ordered, provided or used; labor; transportation and any other
associated costs. Upon Collocator’s request, AT&T-13STATE will provide the Collocator with a
detailed invoice showing the costs it incurred associated with preparation.
8.4 Occupancy
8.4.1 Unless there are unusual circumstances, AT&T-13STATE will notify the Collocator that the
Dedicated Space is ready for occupancy within five (5) business days of AT&T-13STATE
completion of preparation of the Dedicated Space.
8.4.1.1 Upon Collocator’s receipt of such notice, AT&T-13STATE and the requesting Collocator
shall, upon Collocator’s request, conduct an acceptance walk-through of such space. The
Collocator shall schedule the acceptance walk-through on a mutually agreed upon date
within ten (10) Calendar Days of the scheduled Completion date. Any material deviations
from mutually agreed application specifications may be noted by Collocator as exceptions,
which shall be mutually agreed to as exceptions by AT&T-13STATE. These exceptions
shall be corrected by AT&T-13STATE as soon as commercially reasonable after those
exceptions are provided in writing, which exceptions shall be provided no more than five
(5) calendar days after the walk-through. The correction of these exceptions shall be at
AT&T-13STATE’s expense.
8.4.1.2 Upon completion of such corrections, AT&T-13STATE will again notify the Collocator that
the Dedicated Space is ready for occupancy and the Parties will, upon Collocator’s
request, conduct another walk-through as set forth in this Section. If an acceptance walk-
through is not timely requested by Collocator, the completion date for the space shall be
deemed to be the Delivery Date. If an acceptance walk-through is requested, but no
material exceptions are provided at the walk-through, the Delivery Date will be deemed to
be the date of the acceptance walk-through. If an acceptance walk-through is requested,
and material exceptions are noted at the walk-through, the Delivery Date will be deemed to

be the date upon which Collocator accepts all corrections to such exceptions, which
acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.
8.4.1.3 All charges will begin to accrue on the Effective Billing Date, regardless of any failure by
Collocator to complete its work or occupy the space.
8.4.2 Collocator will, whenever possible, place its telecommunications equipment in the Physical
Collocation Space within thirty (30) calendar days of space turnover. Operational
telecommunications equipment must be placed in the Dedicated Space and interconnect to AT&T-
13STATE’s network or obtain access to AT&T-13STATE UNEs within one hundred eighty (180)
days after receipt of such notice, that AT&T-13STATE has completed its work as required by the
complete and accurate Collocation application.
8.4.2.1 In the event that AT&T-13STATE has refused to interconnect with the Collocator, the one
hundred eighty (180) day deadline shall be extended until AT&T-13STATE allows the
Collocator to interconnect. AT&T-13STATE, however, may extend beyond the one
hundred eighty (180) days provided the Collocator demonstrates a best effort to meet that
deadline and shows that circumstances beyond its reasonable control prevented the
Collocator from meeting that deadline.
8.4.2.2 Orders for additional space will not be accepted until the Collocator’s existing Physical
Collocation Space in the requested Eligible Structure is “efficiently used” except to the
extent the Collocator establishes to AT&T's satisfaction that the Collocator's apparent
inefficient use of space is caused by the CLEC holding unused space for future use on the
same basis that AT&T holds unused space for future use Orders for additional Connecting
Facility Assignments (CFAs) will not be accepted until the specific CFA type requested (i.e.
DS0, DS1, fiber, etc.) in the requested Eligible Structure is “efficiently used”.
8.4.2.2.1 For purposes of this Appendix, “efficiently used” space means the Collocator is
using between sixty (60) and one hundred percent (100%) of the Collocator’s
existing collocation space arrangement, caged or cageless, in a particular Eligible
Structure. The determination as to whether this criterion is met or necessary is
solely within the reasonable judgment of AT&T-13STATE.
8.4.2.2.2 For purposes of this Appendix, “efficiently used” CFA means that at least sixty
percent (60%) of the Collocator’s specific type of CFA (cable pairs, coaxial or fiber
facilities) requested is currently being used for the purpose of interconnecting to
AT&T-13STATE’s network for the transmission and routing of telephone
exchange service or exchange access. The determination as to whether this
criterion is met or the use is necessary is solely within the reasonable judgment of
AT&T-13STATE.
8.4.3 If the Collocator fails to place its equipment in the Dedicated Space per Section 8.4.2 and the
unused collocation space is needed to meet customer demand (filed application for space,
accompanied by all fees) for another Collocator or to avoid construction of a building addition,
collocation in the prepared Dedicated Space is terminated on the tenth (10th) business day after
AT&T-13STATE provides the Collocator with written notice of such failure and the Collocator does
not place operational telecommunications equipment in the Dedicated Space and interconnect with
AT&T-13STATE or obtain access to AT&T-13STATE UNEs by that tenth (10th) business day. In
any event, the Collocator shall be liable in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the applicable
charges.
8.4.4 For purposes of this Section, the Collocator’s telecommunications equipment is considered to be
operational and interconnected when connected to either AT&T-13STATE’s network or
interconnected to another Collocator’s equipment that resides within the same structure, provided
the Collocator’s equipment is used for interconnection with AT&T-13STATE’s network or to obtain
access to AT&T-13STATE’s UNEs, for the purpose of providing this service.

8.4.5 If the Collocator causes AT&T-13STATE to prepare the Dedicated Space and then the Collocator
does not use the Dedicated Space (or all the Dedicated Space), the Collocator will pay AT&T-
13STATE the monthly recurring and other applicable charges as if the Collocator were using the
Dedicated Space, until such time as the Collocator submits a complete and accurate
decommissioning application, and the decommissioning process is completed as required.
8.5 Relocation
8.5.1 When AT&T-13STATE determines because of zoning changes, condemnation, or government
order or regulation that it is necessary for the Dedicated Space to be moved within an Eligible
Structure to another Eligible Structure, from an adjacent space collocation structure to a different
adjacent space collocation structure, or from an adjacent space collocation structure to an Eligible
Structure, the Collocator is required to move its Dedicated Space or adjacent space collocation
structure. AT&T-13STATE will notify the resident Collocator(s) in writing within five (5) days of the
determination to move the location. If the relocation occurs for reasons other than an emergency,
AT&T-13STATE will provide the resident Collocator(s) with at least one hundred eighty (180) days
advance written notice prior to the relocation. If the Collocator is required to relocate under this
Section, the Collocator will not be required to pay any application fees associated with the
application required for arranging for new space. The Collocator shall be responsible for the costs
for the preparation of the new telecommunications equipment space and Dedicated Space at the
new location or an adjacent space collocation structure if such relocation arises from
circumstances beyond the reasonable control of AT&T-13STATE, including zoning changes,
condemnation or government order or regulation that makes the continued occupancy or use of the
Dedicated Space or the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located or the adjacent
space collocation structure for the purpose then used, uneconomical in AT&T-13STATE’s
reasonable discretion. In addition, a Collocator’s presence in AT&T-13STATE Central Offices or
adjacent space collocation structures should not prevent AT&T-13STATE from making a
reasonable business decision regarding building expansions or additions the number of Central
Offices required to conduct its business or its locations.
8.5.2 If AT&T-13STATE determines that a Collocator must relocate due to any of the above reasons,
AT&T-13STATE will make all reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of the Collocator’s services.
In addition, the costs of the move will be shared equally by AT&T-13STATE and the Collocator,
unless the Parties agree to a different financial arrangement.
8.5.3 If the Collocator requests that the Dedicated Space be moved within the Eligible Structure in which
the Dedicated Space is located, to another Eligible Structure, from an adjacent space collocation
structure to a different adjacent space collocation structure or to an Eligible Structure, AT&T-
13STATE shall permit the Collocator to relocate the Dedicated Space or adjacent space
collocation structure, subject to availability of space and technical feasibility. The Collocator shall
be responsible for all applicable charges associated with the move, including the reinstallation of its
equipment and facilities and the preparation of the new telecommunications equipment space, and
Dedicated Space, or adjacent space collocation structure as applicable. In any such event, the
new Dedicated Space shall be deemed the Dedicated Space and the new Eligible Structure (where
applicable) shall be deemed the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located and the
new adjacent space collocation structure shall be deemed the adjacent space collocation structure.
8.5.3.1 AT&T-13STATE shall maintain a publicly available document for viewing on the Internet at
https://clec.att.com/clec indicating its Eligible Structures, if any, that have no space
available for Physical Collocation. AT&T-13STATE will update this document within ten
(10) calendar days of the date at which an Eligible Structure runs out of Physical
Collocation space.
8.5.3.2 AT&T-13STATE will remove obsolete unused equipment from its Eligible Structures that
have no space available for Physical Collocation upon reasonable request by a Collocator
or upon order of the appropriate Commission. AT&T-13STATE shall reserve space for
switching, MDF and DCS to accommodate access line growth.

8.6 Early Termination
8.6.1 Payment Upon Expiration or Termination
In the case of the expiration or termination of this Appendix prior to term, or the early termination of any
collocation services or arrangement(s), pursuant to Section 8.6.2 of this Appendix AT&T-13STATE
shall be entitled to full payment within thirty (30) days of such expiration or termination for all services
performed and expenses accrued or incurred that AT&T-13STATE is entitled to recover under the
provisions of this Appendix for establishing such Collocation arrangement prior to such expiration or
termination.
8.6.2 If Collocator cancels or abandons its collocation space in any of AT&T-13STATE’s central offices
before AT&T-13STATE has recovered the full cost associated with providing that space to the
Collocator, the amount of any such remaining costs shall become immediately due and payable
within thirty (30) days after the Collocator abandons that space.
8.7 Dispute Resolution – Except as otherwise provided herein, Dispute Resolution will be governed by the
General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
8.8 Non-billing Dispute
8.8.1 In the event of a bona fide dispute between a Collocator and AT&T-13STATE, Collocator shall
include in written notice the following information: (a) the Central Office involved in the controversy,
(b) the date controversy occurred, (c) detailed description of the controversy, (d) along with any
and all documentation from both Parties. Failure to provide the information required by this Section
not later than twenty-nine (29) days following the initial submission of the controversy, shall
constitute Collocator’s irrevocable and full waiver of its right to file a dispute.
8.9 Billing – Except as otherwise provided herein, Billing will be governed by the General Terms and
Conditions of this Appendix.
8.10 Allowances for Interruptions
8.10.1 An interruption period begins when an inoperative condition of a Physical Collocation arrangement
is reported to AT&T-13STATE’s designated contact point and ends when the Physical Collocation
arrangement is operative and reported to the Collocator’s designated contact. A credit allowance
will be made to the Collocator where the interruption is due to the actions or negligence of AT&T-
13STATE.
8.10.2 When a credit allowance does apply, such credit will be determined based on the monthly recurring
rates applicable to the specific item(s) causing the interruption; however, the credit allowance for
an interruption or for a series of interruptions shall not exceed the applicable monthly recurring rate
for the item(s) involved.
8.10.3 For calculating credit allowances, every month is considered to have thirty (30) days. No credit
shall be allowed for an interruption of less than thirty (30) minutes. The Collocator shall be credited
for an interruption of thirty (30) minutes or more at the rate of 1/1440 of the monthly recurring rate.
8.10.4 A credit allowance will not apply to any interruption of the items maintained and repaired by the
Collocator or the Collocator’s third Party vendor.
9. FIBER OPTIC CABLE AND DEMARCATION POINT
9.1 Fiber Optic Cable Entrances
9.1.1 The Collocator shall use a dielectric fire retardant fiber cable as the transmission medium to the
Dedicated Space or, where technically and structurally feasible, may use microwave. Collocation
requests utilizing facilities other than fiber will be provided as an Individual Case Basis (ICB).
AT&T-13STATE will only permit copper or coaxial cable as the transmission medium where the
Collocator can demonstrate to AT&T-13STATE that use of such cable will not impair AT&T-
13STATE’s ability to service its own customers or subsequent Collocators.

051007
9.1.2 AT&T-13STATE shall provide a minimum of two separate points of entry into the Eligible Structure,
where applicable, in which the Dedicated Space is located wherever there are at least two entry
points for AT&T-13STATE cable. AT&T-13STATE will also provide nondiscriminatory access to
any entry point into Eligible Structures in excess of two (2) points in those locations where AT&T-
13STATE also has access to more than two such entry points. Where such dual points of entry
are not immediately available, AT&T-13STATE shall perform work as is necessary to make
available such separate points of entry for the Collocator at the same time that it makes such
separate points of entry available for itself. In each instance where AT&T-13STATE performs such
work in order to accommodate its own needs and those specified by the Collocator in the
Collocator’s written request, the Collocator and AT&T-13STATE shall share the costs incurred by
prorating those costs using the number of cables to be placed in the entry point by both AT&T-
13STATE and the Collocator(s).
9.1.3 The Collocator is responsible for bringing its facilities to the entrance manhole(s) designated by
AT&T-13STATE, and leaving sufficient length of the cable in the manhole for AT&T-13STATE to
fully extend the Collocator-provided facilities through the cable vault to the Dedicated Space. If
Collocator has not left the cable in the manhole within one hundred twenty (120) calendar of the
request for entrance fiber, the Collocator’s request for entrance fiber will expire and a new request
must be submitted along with applicable fees. The Collocator must notify AT&T-13STATE no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the end of the 120 day period, for an additional thirty (30)
day extension to place cable at the manhole.
9.2 Demarcation Point
9.2.1 The demarcation point is the end of the AT&T-13STATE provided interconnection cable at the
Collocation arrangement (CDOW- AT&T owned frame location as assigned to the Collocator).
10. USE OF DEDICATED SPACE
10.1 Nature of Use - Collocatable Equipment
10.1.1 In accordance with Section 251(c)(6) of the Act, the Collocator may collocate equipment for
Physical Collocation if such equipment is necessary for interconnection to AT&T-13STATE under
47.U.S.C. § 251(C) (2) or accessing AT&T-13STATE’s UNEs under 47.U.S.C. § 251(C) (3) of the
Act. Such uses are limited to interconnection to AT&T-13STATE’s network “for the transmission
and routing of Telephone Exchange service or Exchange Access,” or for access to AT&T-
13STATE's UNEs “for the provision of a telecommunications service”.
10.1.2 Equipment is necessary for interconnection if an inability to deploy that equipment would, as a
practical, economic, or operations matter, preclude the Collocator from obtaining interconnection
with AT&T-13STATE at a level equal in quality to that which AT&T-13STATE obtains within its
own network or AT&T-13STATE provides to an affiliate, subsidiary, or other party. Equipment is
necessary for access to an unbundled network element if an inability to deploy that equipment
would, as a practical, economic, or operational matter, preclude the Collocator from obtaining non-
discriminatory access to that unbundled network element, including any of its features, functions, or
capabilities.
10.1.3 Multi-functional equipment shall be deemed necessary for interconnection or access to an
unbundled network element if and only if the primary purpose and function of the equipment, as the
Collocator seeks to deploy it, meets either or both of the standards set forth above in this Section.
For a piece of equipment to be utilized primarily to obtain equal in quality interconnection or non-
discriminatory access to one or more unbundled network elements, there also must be a logical
nexus between the additional functions the equipment would perform and the telecommunication
services the Collocator seeks to provide to its customers by means of the interconnection or
unbundled network element. The collocation of those functions of the equipment that, as stand-
alone functions, do not meet either of the standards set forth above in this Section must not cause
the equipment to significantly increase the burden of AT&T-13STATE’s property.

051007
10.1.4 AT&T-13STATE voluntarily allows Collocator to place ancillary equipment and facilities, including
cross-connect and other simple frames, routers, portable test equipment, equipment racks and
bays, and other ancillary equipment and facilities on a non-discriminatory basis only if AT&T-
13STATE and Collocator mutually agree to such placement, in AT&T-13STATE's premises solely
to support and be used with equipment that the Collocator has legitimately collocated in the same
premises.
10.1.5 AT&T-13STATE does not assume any responsibility for the installation, furnishing, designing,
engineering, or performance of the Collocator’s equipment and facilities.
10.1.6 When the Collocator’s Physical Collocation arrangement is within the Eligible Structure, the
Collocator may not provide its own DC power plant equipment (with rectifiers or chargers and
batteries) or AC power backup equipment (e.g., Uninterruptable Power System with batteries, or
standby engine). AT&T-13STATE will provide the necessary backup power to ensure against
power outages.
10.1.7 Consistent with the environment of the Dedicated Space, the Collocator shall not use the
Dedicated Space for office, retail, or sales purposes. No signage or marking of any kind by the
Collocator shall be permitted on the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located or
on AT&T-13STATE grounds surrounding the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is
located. The Collocator may place signage and markings on the inside of its dedicated space.
10.2 Equipment List
10.2.1 A list of all the equipment and facilities that the Collocator will place within its Dedicated Space
must be included on the application for which the Dedicated Space is prepared including the
associated power requirements, floor loading, and heat release of each piece. The Collocator’s
equipment and facilities shall be compliant with the standards set out in Section 12.1, Minimum
Standards, following. The Collocator warrants and represents that the list is complete and
accurate, and acknowledges that any incompleteness or inaccuracy would be a violation of the
rules and regulations governing this Appendix. The Collocator shall not place or leave any
equipment or facilities within the Dedicated Space not included on the list without the express
written consent of AT&T-13STATE, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.2.2 Subsequent Requests to Place Equipment
10.2.2.1 The Collocator shall furnish AT&T-13STATE a written list in the form of an attachment to
the original equipment list for the subsequent placement of equipment in its Dedicated
Space. When the Collocator’s equipment is not listed in the approved All Equipment List
(AEL) the equipment will be reviewed by AT&T-13STATE and written approval or denial
of the equipment will be forwarded to the Collocator.
10.2.3 Limitations
10.2.3.1 AT&T-13STATE’s obligation to purchase additional plant or equipment, relinquish
occupied space or facilities, to undertake the construction of new building quarters or to
construct building additions or substantial improvements to the central office infrastructure
of existing quarters in order to satisfy a request for space or the placement of additional
equipment or facilities by a Collocator, is limited to the extent that AT&T-13STATE would
undertake such additions, modifications or construction on its own behalf, on behalf of any
subsidiary or affiliate, or for any other Party to which it provides interconnection. AT&T-
13STATE will ensure that the Collocator is provided collocation space at least equal in
quality to that provided to AT&T-13STATE, its affiliates or other Parties to which it
provides interconnection.
10.3 Dedicated Space Use and Access
10.3.1 The Collocator’s employees, agents and contractors shall be permitted access to its collocated
equipment seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours a day without a security escort.
Collocator shall provide AT&T-13STATE with notice at the time of dispatch of its own employee or

contractor, to an Eligible Structure and, if possible, no less than thirty (30) minutes notice for a
manned structure and sixty (60) minutes notice for an unmanned structure.
10.3.2 AT&T-13STATE will not delay a Collocator employee’s entry into an Eligible Structure containing
its collocated equipment or its access to its collocated equipment. AT&T-13STATE will provide
Collocator with reasonable access to restroom facilities and parking. All access is provided subject
to compliance by the Collocator’s employees, agents and contractors with AT&T-13STATE’s
policies and practices pertaining to fire, safety and security (i.e., the Collocator must comply with
Section 6 of this Appendix).
10.3.3 The Collocator agrees to comply promptly with all laws, ordinances and regulations affecting the
use of the Dedicated Space. Upon the discontinuance of service, the Collocator shall surrender
the Dedicated Space or land for an adjacent structure to AT&T-13STATE, in the same condition as
when first occupied by the Collocator, except for ordinary wear and tear.
10.3.4 AT&T-13STATE will not accept delivery of nor responsibility for any correspondence and/or
equipment delivered to the Collocator at the Eligible Structure. However, through agreement
between AT&T-13STATE and the Collocator, a Collocator may make arrangements for receipt
and/or securing of its equipment at the Eligible Structure by Collocator’s or AT&T-13STATE’s
personnel.
10.4 Threat to Personnel, Network or Facilities
10.4.1 Regarding safety, Collocator equipment or operating practices representing a significant
demonstrable technical or physical threat to AT&T-13STATE’s personnel, network or facilities,
including the Eligible Structure, or those of others are strictly prohibited.
10.5 Interference or Impairment
10.5.1 Regarding safety and notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the characteristics and methods
of operation of any equipment or facilities placed in the Dedicated Space shall not create hazards
for or cause damage to those facilities, the Dedicated Space, or the Eligible Structure in which the
Dedicated Space is located; impair the privacy of any communications carried in, from, or through
the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located; or create hazards or cause physical
harm to any individual or the public. Any of the foregoing would be in violation of this Appendix.
10.6 Personal Property and Its Removal
10.6.1 In accordance with and subject to the conditions of this Appendix, the Collocator may place or
install in or on the Dedicated Space such personal property or fixtures (Property) as it shall deem
desirable for the conduct of business. Property placed by the Collocator in the Dedicated Space
shall not become a part of the Dedicated Space even if nailed, screwed or otherwise fastened to
the Dedicated Space. Such Property must meet AT&T-13STATE standards for flame and smoke
ratings, e.g., no combustibles. Such Property shall retain its status as personal and may be
removed by the Collocator at any time. Any damage caused to the Dedicated Space or land
occupied by an adjacent structure by the removal of such Property shall be promptly repaired by
the Collocator at its expense pursuant to Section 10.7 following.
10.7 Alterations
10.7.1 In no case shall the Collocator or any person acting through or on behalf of the Collocator make
any rearrangement, modification, improvement, addition, repair, or other alteration to the Dedicated
Space or the Eligible Structure in which the Dedicated Space is located without the advance written
permission and direction of AT&T-13STATE. AT&T-13STATE shall consider a modification,
improvement, addition, repair or other alteration requested by the Collocator, provided that AT&T-
13STATE has the right to reject or modify any such request except as required by state or federal
regulators. The cost of any AT&T-13STATE provided construction shall be paid by the Collocator
in accordance with AT&T-13STATE's custom work order process.

11. USE BY OTHER LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
11.1 Shared Caged Collocation is the sharing of a Caged Physical Collocation space among two (2) or more
Collocators within an Eligible Structure pursuant to the terms and conditions agreed to between the
Collocators. The AT&T-13STATE will make Shared Collocation cages available to all Collocators. In
making shared caged arrangements available AT&T-13STATE will not increase the cost of site
preparation for non-recurring charges above the cost of provisioning such a cage of similar dimensions
and material to a single collocating party ordering the same arrangement.
11.1.1 All Collocators, including those who are subleasing the caged space, are bound by the terms and
conditions of this Appendix. Subject to the terms in paragraph 10.4, the Collocator shall not assign
or otherwise transfer, either in whole or in part, or permit the use of any part of the Dedicated
Space by any other person or entity, without the prior written consent of AT&T-13STATE, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported assignment or transfer made without
such consent shall be voidable at the sole discretion of AT&T-13STATE.
11.2 A Collocator may request that AT&T-13STATE provide Shared Caged Collocation via:
(i) a new request for Physical Collocation whereby the Collocator requesting such space allocates the
requested space among the number of Collocators initially requesting such space (“New Shared
Collocation”), or
(ii) a request by Collocator to enter into a sublease arrangement with another Resident Collocators(s) in
Collocator's existing Physical Collocation (“Subleased Shared Collocation”).
11.2.1 Should two (2) or more Collocators have interconnection agreements with AT&T-13STATE use a
shared collocation cage, AT&T-13STATE will permit each Collocator to order UNEs to and
provision service from that shared collocation space, regardless of which Collocator was the
original Collocator.
11.2.2 The Primary Collocator shall submit a request and any subsequent order for New Shared
Collocation. The Collocator must use a contractor/vendor to perform the necessary preparation
activities within the Collocator’s Physical Collocation Space including the construction of the cage
and any physical security arrangements, if applicable; provided, however, any such
contractor/vendor shall be subject to the prior written approval of AT&T-13STATE, such Physical
Collocation Space preparation activities shall be in accordance with all approved plans and
specifications and coordinated with AT&T-13STATE, and the Collocator shall be solely responsible
for all charges of any such contractor/vendor. The Collocator must provide a cage enclosure (not
including a top), cable rack and support structure inside the cage, lighting, receptacles, cage
grounding, cage sign and door key set.
11.2.3 In each Shared Caged Collocation arrangement, AT&T-13STATE’s single point of contact (SPOC)
with respect to such arrangement shall be referred to as the “Primary Collocator”. For New Shared
Collocation, the Primary Collocator shall be the single Collocator that submits the request for New
Shared Collocation on behalf of the other Resident Collocators (as defined below). For Subleased
Shared Collocation, the Primary Collocator shall be the Collocator that originally requested and
occupied such space and is the sublessor in such arrangement.
11.2.3.1 For purposes of this Section, each Collocator (including Resident Collocator(s) and the
Primary Collocator) to a Shared Caged Collocation arrangement is sometimes referred to
as a “Resident Collocator”.
11.2.4 An order for Shared Caged Collocation shall include blanket letters of authorization signed by the
Primary Collocator that authorize each other Resident Collocator to utilize the Connecting Facility
Assignments associated with the Primary Collocator and signed by each Resident Collocator that
authorize the Primary Collocator to request and place firm orders for Shared Caged Collocation
and facilities on behalf of such Resident Collocators.

11.3 New Shared Collocation is available in minimum increments of fifty (50) square feet (per caged space
dimensions, not per Collocator). Space totaling less than fifty (50) square feet will be provided where
technically feasible. Resident Collocators shall request New Shared Collocation from AT&T-13STATE in
a single application. AT&T-13STATE will prorate the Preparation Charges incurred by AT&T-13STATE
to condition the space for Collocation use among the Resident Collocators utilizing the New Shared
Collocation space, by determining the total preparation charges to make that space available and
allocating that charge to each Resident Collocator based on the percentage attributable to each Resident
Collocator as provided on the Collocation order by the Primary Collocator, provided that the percentage
attributable to the Resident Collocators in a New Shared Collocation space equals in the aggregate one
hundred percent (100%). AT&T-13STATE will prorate the charge for site conditioning and preparation
undertaken to condition the collocation space so the first Collocator in an AT&T-13STATE Premise will
not be responsible for the entire cost of site preparation. Allocation of Preparation Charges shall occur
only upon the initial delivery of New Shared Collocation and AT&T-13STATE shall not be required to
adjust such allocation if another Resident Collocator subsequently shares such space. Except with
respect to prorated Preparation Charges, AT&T-13STATE shall bill only the Primary Collocator for, and
the Primary Collocator shall be the primary obligor with respect to the payment of, all charges other than
Preparation Charges billed on New Shared Collocation. It is the Primary Collocator’s responsibility to
recover from each other Resident Collocator such Collocator’s proportionate share of such other charges
billed to the Primary Collocator for the New Shared Cage Collocation. If Collocator is a Resident
Collocator but not the Primary Collocator in a New Shared Collocation arrangement, Collocator agrees
that the Primary Collocator’s rates, terms and conditions relating to New Shared Collocation set forth in
the Primary Collocator’s Section 251/252 agreement under which the Primary Collocator purchases
collocation shall apply to its New Shared Collocation arrangement in lieu of those set forth herein.
Further, if Collocator is the Primary Collocator in a New Shared Collocation arrangement, as a condition
of ordering New Shared Allocation, Collocator shall require its Resident Collocator(s) to execute an
agreement prior to the Delivery Date that, inter alia, requires such Resident Collocator(s)' compliance with
the terms, conditions and restrictions relating to Collocation contained in this Agreement and designates
AT&T-13STATE as a third party beneficiary of such agreement. Collocator, acting in its capacity as
Primary Collocator, shall notify its Resident Collocator(s) of the obligation to comply with this Agreement
with respect to the New Shared Collocation arrangement and shall be responsible for any breach of such
provisions by the Resident Collocator(s).
11.4 For Subleased Shared Collocation, if the Collocator is the Primary Collocator, then that (Primary)
Collocator shall be responsible for its and its Resident Collocator's compliance with the terms, conditions
and restrictions of this Appendix. As a condition to permitting another Collocator to sublease space from
Collocator, Collocator shall require such other Collocator(s) to execute a sublease agreement prior to the
Delivery Date that, inter alia, requires such Collocator’s compliance with the terms, conditions and
restrictions relating to Collocation contained in this Appendix and designates AT&T-13STATE as a third
party beneficiary of such agreement. Collocator, acting in its capacity as Primary Collocator, shall notify
its Resident Collocator(s) of the obligation to comply with this Appendix relating to Physical Collocation
and shall be responsible for any breach of such provisions by the Resident Collocator(s). If Collocator is
the sublessee (i.e., not the Primary Collocator) in a Subleased Shared Collocation arrangement,
Collocator agrees that Primary Collocator's rates, terms and conditions relating to Subleased Shared
Collocations set forth in the Primary Collocator's Section 251/252 agreement shall apply to its Subleased
Shared Collocation arrangement in lieu of those set forth herein.
11.5 Collocator with which it shares Shared Caged Collocation space shall collocate equipment only as
permitted by Section 8.4.2 of this Appendix and which is necessary to Interconnect with AT&T-13STATE
or for access to AT&T-13STATE’s Unbundled Network Elements. AT&T-13STATE shall provide
Collocator access to AT&T-13STATE’s Unbundled Network Elements and permit Collocator to
interconnect its network with AT&T-13STATE from Shared Caged Collocation, regardless if Collocator
was the original Collocator. Collocator, however, shall have no right to request and AT&T-13STATE shall
have no obligation to provide Collocator’s Resident Collocators access to AT&T-13STATE’s Unbundled
Network Elements or AT&T-13STATE’s network. Instead, a Resident Collocator's rights shall be as

determined by such Resident Collocator’s contractual arrangement (Section 251/252 agreement) with
AT&T-13STATE.
11.6 As a condition of entering into Shared Caged Collocation, Collocator agrees that if it is not the Primary
Collocator in a New Shared Collocation, or if it is the sublessee in a Subleased Shared Collocation
arrangement, it unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes and guarantees AT&T-13STATE the prompt
and full payment of any charges assessed on the Shared Caged Collocation. If the Primary Collocator in
a Shared Caged Collocation arrangement no longer occupies the space, the other Resident Collocators
must immediately identify a new Primary Collocator. If only one Collocator remains in the Shared Cage
Collocation, that Collocator shall become the Primary Collocator. AT&T-13STATE shall bill the new
Primary Collocator any applicable charges to change AT&T-13STATE’s records and databases to reflect
such new Primary Collocator.
11.7 Interconnection to Others
11.7.1 Within a contiguous area within the eligible structure, the AT&T-13STATE will permit Collocators to
construct their own direct connection (cross-connect) facilities to other physical Collocators using
copper or optical facilities between collocated equipment located within the same Eligible Structure,
subject only to the same reasonable safety requirements that AT&T-13STATE imposes on its own
equipment. AT&T-13STATE shall not require physical-to-physical Collocators to purchase any
equipment or cross-connect capabilities solely from AT&T-13STATE. If requested by the
Collocator, AT&T-13STATE will provide only the installation of physical structure(s) and the
associated labor necessary for the Collocator(s) to pull its facilities from its equipment space to the
equipment space of another Collocator. However if the Collocators cannot physically pull the cable
themselves (i.e. located on different floors), AT&T-13STATE will perform the necessary
construction on a standard Custom Work Order basis and perform the cable pull. AT&T-13STATE
(1) will not make any physical connection within the Collocator’s dedicated space; (2) will not have
any liability for the cable or the connections, or the traffic carried thereon; and (3) will not maintain
any records concerning these connections.
11.7.2 If a physical Collocator and a virtual Collocator both have purchased dedicated appearances not
then in use on a DSX-1 panel, DSX-3 panel, or FDF located within contiguous areas within the
eligible structure, then AT&T-13STATE will permit the interconnection of physically and virtually
collocated equipment by connection of copper or optical facilities to the Collocators’ dedicated
appearances on the DSX-1 panel, DSX-3 panel, or FDF, subject only to the same reasonable
safety requirements that AT&T-13STATE imposes on its own equipment. The connections shall
be made within ten (10) days of a joint request by the Collocators. At AT&T-13STATE’s option,
the connection may be made either by AT&T-13STATE or by the Collocators’ installers, who shall
be on the list of approved installation vendors.
12. STANDARDS
12.1 Minimum Standards
12.1.1 All types of network equipment placed in AT&T-13STATE network equipment areas of Eligible
Structures by AT&T-13STATE or Collocator must meet AT&T-13STATE minimum safety
standards. The minimum safety standards are as follows: (1) Collocator’s equipment must meet
Telcordia Level 1 safety requirements as set forth in Technical Publication 76200, Network
Equipment Building Systems (NEBS); or, (2) Collocator must demonstrate that its equipment has a
history of safe operation defined by installation in an ILEC (including AT&T-13STATE) prior to
January 1, 1998 with no known history of safety problems. The Collocator will be expected to
conform to the same accepted procedures and standards utilized by including AT&T-13STATE
and its contractors when engineering and installing equipment.
12.1.2 In the event that AT&T-13STATE denied Collocation of Collocator’s equipment, citing safety
standards, AT&T-13STATE will provide within five (5) business days of Collocator’s written request
to AT&T-13STATE representative(s), a list of AT&T-13STATE equipment which AT&T-13STATE

locates within the premises of the Eligible Structure for which Collocation was denied together with
an affidavit attesting that all of such AT&T-13STATE equipment met or exceeded the same safety
standards for which Collocator's equipment was denied.
12.1.3 In the event AT&T-13STATE believes that collocated equipment is not necessary for
interconnection or access to UNEs or determines that the Collocator’s equipment does not meet
the minimum safety standards, the Collocator must not collocate the equipment unless and until
the dispute is resolved in its favor. The Collocator will be given ten (10) business days to comply
with the requirements and/or remove the equipment from the collocation space if the equipment
was already improperly collocated. Dispute resolution procedures are covered in the Agreement.
If the Parties do not resolve the dispute under those dispute resolution procedures, AT&T-
13STATE or Collocator may file a complaint at the Commission seeking a formal resolution of the
dispute. If it is determined that the Collocator’s equipment does not meet the minimum safety
standards above, the Collocator must not collocate the equipment and will be responsible for
removal of the equipment and all resulting damages if the equipment already was collocated
improperly.
12.1.4 Collocation equipment or operating practices representing a significant demonstrable technical or
physical threat to AT&T-13STATE personnel, network or facilities, including the Eligible Structure
or those of others is strictly prohibited. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the
characteristics and methods of operation of any equipment or facilities placed in the Physical
Collocation space shall not create hazards for or cause damage to those facilities, the Physical
Collocation space, or the Eligible Structure in which the Physical Collocation space is located;
impair the privacy of any communications carried in, from, or through the Eligible Structure in which
the Physical Collocation space is located; or create hazards or cause physical harm to any
individual or the public. Any of the foregoing would be in violation of this Appendix. Disputes
regarding proper implementation of operating practices or technical standards may be resolved
under the standards of Sections 8.7.2 above.
12.2 Compliance Certification
12.2.1 The Collocator also warrants and represents that any equipment or facilities that may be placed in
the Dedicated Space pursuant to Section 10.2, Equipment List; Section 10.2.1, Subsequent
Requests to Place Equipment, Section 10.2.2; or otherwise, shall be compliant with minimum
safety standards set forth in Section 3.4.
13. RE-ENTRY
13.1 If the Collocator shall default in performance of any provision herein, and the default shall continue for
sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of AT&T-13STATE’s written notice, or if the Collocator is declared
bankrupt or insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, AT&T-13STATE may,
immediately or at any time thereafter, without notice or demand, enter and repossess the Dedicated
Space, expel the Collocator and any claiming under the Collocator, remove the Collocator’s property,
forcibly if necessary, and services provided pursuant to this Appendix will be terminated without prejudice
to any other remedies AT&T-13STATE might have.
13.2 AT&T-13STATE may also refuse additional applications for service and/or refuse to complete any
pending orders for additional space or service for the Collocator at any time after sending the notice
required by the preceding Section.
13.3 In the case of any dispute and at the written request of a Party, each Party will appoint a knowledgeable,
responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this
Appendix. The location, form, frequency, duration, and conclusion of these discussions will be left to the
discretion of the representatives. Upon agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative
informal dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and
the correspondence among the representatives for purposes of settlement are exempt from discovery and
production and will not be admissible in the arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the

concurrence of both Parties. Documents identified in or provided with such communications, which are
not prepared for purposes of the negotiations, are not so exempted and, if otherwise admissible, may be
admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit. To the extent negotiations do not resolve the dispute,
and thirty (30) days have passed since the date of the request for resolution under this Section, Parties
may seek more formal dispute resolution procedures.
14. SERVICES AND MAINTENANCE
14.1 Operating Services
14.1.1 AT&T-13STATE shall maintain for the Eligible Structure customary building services, utilities
(excluding telephone facilities), including janitorial and elevator services, twenty-four (24) hours a

administrative use within its Dedicated Space will be provided in accordance with applicable AT&T-
13STATE tariffs.
14.2 Maintenance
14.2.1 AT&T-13STATE shall maintain the exterior of the Eligible Structure and grounds, and all
entrances, stairways, passageways, and exits used by the Collocator to access the Dedicated
Space.
14.3 Equipment Staging and Storage
14.3.1 No storage or staging area will be provided outside of the licensed space. Collocation areas may
not be used for office administrative space (i.e., filing cabinet, desk, etc.). Fire standards and
regulations prohibit the storage of flammable material, e.g., cardboard boxes, paper, packing
material, etc. Safety standards prohibit the storage of chemicals of any kind. (Refer to
Interconnector’s Guide for Collocation via https://clec.att.com/clec.)
14.4 Legal Requirements
14.4.1 Except for Section 17, AT&T-13STATE agrees to make, at its expense, all changes and additions
to the Dedicated Space required by laws, ordinances, orders or regulations of any municipality,
county, state or other public authority including the furnishing of required sanitary facilities and fire
protection facilities, except fire protection facilities specially required because of the installation of
telephone or electronic equipment and fixtures in the Dedicated Space.
15. AT&T-13STATE’S RIGHT OF ACCESS
15.1 AT&T-13STATE, its agents, employees, and other AT&T-13STATE-authorized persons shall have the
right to enter Dedicated Space at any reasonable time on three (3) days advance notice of the time and
purpose of the entry to examine its condition, make repairs required to be made by AT&T-13STATE
hereunder, and for any other purpose deemed reasonable by AT&T-13STATE. AT&T-13STATE may
access the Dedicated Space for purpose of averting any threat of harm imposed by the Collocator or its
equipment or facilities upon the operation of AT&T-13STATE equipment, facilities and/or personnel
located outside of the Dedicated Space without such advance notice; in such case, AT&T-13STATE will
notify the Collocator by telephone of that entry and will leave written notice of entry in the Dedicated
Space. If routine inspections are required, they shall be conducted at a mutually agreeable time.

051007
16.3 The Collocator will be permitted to contract its own work for the preparation activities within the
Collocator’s cage including the construction of physical security arrangements. However, any such
contractor shall be subject to the approval of AT&T-13STATE, such Dedicated Space preparation
activities shall be in accordance with all approved plans and specifications and coordinated with AT&T-
13STATE, and the Collocator shall be solely responsible for all charges of any such contractor. Use of
any such contractor shall not nullify the construction interval with respect to the preparation of the
Telecommunications Infrastructure Area and Custom Work.
17. CHARGES
17.1 Monthly Charges
17.1.1 The flat-rate monthly recurring charges shall begin the earlier of when the first circuit is turned up
or five (5) days after the Collocator has been notified that the preparation of the Dedicated Space is
complete, and shall apply each month or fraction thereof that Physical Collocation is provided. For
billing purposes, each month is considered to have thirty (30) days. The applicable recurring
charges are set forth in the Collocation Rate Summary for use of the Dedicated Space.
17.2 Non-recurring Charges
17.2.1 Non-recurring charges are one-time charges that apply for specific work activity associated with
providing Physical Collocation, per request, per Eligible Structure.
17.2.2 With respect to any preparation of the Dedicated Space, the Collocator shall pay AT&T-13STATE
fifty percent (50%) of the estimated non-recurring charges as specified for in Section 17 and fifty
percent (50%) of any Custom Work Charges preceding the commencement of work.
17.2.3 The remaining portion of any Custom Work Charge is due upon completion. The remaining portion
of the Preparation Charge shall be paid by the Collocator when the Dedicated Space is complete
and prior to occupancy.
17.3 Application of Rates and Charges
17.3.1 Beginning on and after the Effective Date of this agreement, the Parties agree that the rates and
charges for Collocation shall be as set forth in this Appendix and in the Pricing Schedule applicable
to collocation (“Collocation Rates”). The Parties agree that the Collocation Rates shall apply, on a
prospective basis only, beginning on the Effective Date of this agreement, to all existing CLEC
collocation arrangements, including those established before the Effective Date of this agreement.
Because the Collocation Rates will apply on a prospective basis only, neither Party shall have a
right to retroactive application of the Collocation Rates to any time period before the Effective Date,
and there shall be no retroactive right of true-up for any time period before the Effective Date.
17.4 Determination of Charges Not Established in Collocation Rate Summary
17.4.1 Rate Elements - In the event that AT&T-13STATE seeks to impose a rate element or charge to a
Collocator that is not specifically provided for in this Appendix or in the Pricing Schedule, AT&T-
13STATE shall be required to provide the quote for the rate element within the same time frames
provided for in this Appendix.
17.4.2 In the event the Collocator disputes the rate element or charge proposed by AT&T-13STATE that
is not specifically provided for in this Appendix or in the Pricing Schedule, the Collocator shall notify
AT&T-13STATE of its dispute with the proposed charge in writing.
17.5 Custom Work Charges - Custom work may not be charged to Collocator for any work performed which
will benefit or be used by AT&T-13STATE or other Collocators. AT&T-13STATE also may not impose a
Custom Work Charge without the Collocator’s approval and agreement that the custom work is not
included in the provision of collocation as provided for in the rate elements contained in this Appendix. In
the event an agreement between the Collocator and AT&T-13STATE is not reached regarding the
Custom Work Charge, AT&T-13STATE shall complete construction of the Collocator’s space pending
resolution of the issue by the appropriate Commission and the Collocator may withhold payment for the
Page 100 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 34 OF 55
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
051007
disputed charges while the issue remains unresolved; however, any disputed Custom Work Charges paid
by the Collocator or owed to AT&T-13STATE shall accrue interest at the rate established by the
appropriate Commission. All Custom Work Charges that are approved by the appropriate Commission will
be the basis for calculating a refund to a Collocator that has overpaid or the amount due to AT&T-
13STATE that was not paid or underpaid. These overpaid or underpaid amounts will accrue at the
above-stated interest rate on a monthly basis from the date of completion of the work or the date of
payment of the disputed amount, as appropriate. In the event that the requested work will benefit all or
most Collocators, such work shall not be considered custom work; instead, AT&T-13STATE shall file the
appropriate interconnection agreement amendment. However, AT&T-13STATE shall not delay
completion of such work during the agreement approval process. AT&T-13STATE shall perform such
work based upon provisional rates, subject to true up.
17.6 Extraordinary Charges - Collocator will be responsible for all extraordinary construction costs, incurred by
AT&T-13STATE to prepare the Collocation space for the installation of Collocator’s equipment and for
extraordinary costs to maintain the Collocation space for Collocator’s equipment on a going-forward basis.
Extraordinary costs may include costs for such items as asbestos removal, fire suppression system or
containment, modifications or expansion of cable entry facility, increasing the DC power system infrastructure
capacity, increasing the capacity of the AC system (if available), or of the existing commercial power facility,
installation, maintenance, repair, monitoring of securing measures, conversion of non-Collocation space, or
other modifications required by local ordinances. Ordinary costs may become extraordinary by their unusual
nature (e.g. volume that is substantially beyond the average or typical Collocation arrangement or request) or
its infrequency of occurrence (e.g. construction that will benefit only the requesting Collocator).
17.6.1 AT&T-13STATE will charge a one-time, non-recurring fee for extraordinary costs on a time-
sensitive or time-and-materials basis.
17.6.2 AT&T-13STATE will allocate the costs fairly among itself, CLEC and other Collocators, as
appropriate.
17.6.3 An estimate of such costs plus contribution will be provided to the Collocator prior to AT&T-
13STATE commencing such work. In no case will actual charges exceed those estimated by more
than ten (10) percent.
17.6.4 AT&T-13STATE must advise Collocator if extraordinary costs will be incurred within twenty (20)
business days of the Collocator’s request for space.
17.6.5 Extraordinary costs will only be billed upon receipt of the signed acceptance and construction will
not begin until receipt of the Collocator’s signed acceptance and payment.
18. RATE REGULATIONS (AT&T-13STATE DOES ALL WORK)
18.1 The Collocator may elect to have AT&T-13STATE provision the collocation site or the Collocator may
elect to hire an AT&T-13STATE Approved Tier 1 Vendor to provision the collocation site per Section 21,
CDOW (Collocator Does Own Work).
18.2 Rate Elements
All rates and charges for the following rate elements can be found in the Collocation Rate Summary.
18.2.1 Planning Fees
18.2.1.1 The Planning Fee, as specified in AT&T-13STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services
Handbook for Physical Collocation in AT&T-13STATE, recovers AT&T-13STATE’s costs
incurred to estimate the quotation of charges, project management costs, engineering
costs, and other related planning activities for the Collocator’s request for the Physical
Collocation arrangements. The initial Planning Fee will apply to the Collocator’s Physical
Collocation request. In addition, a non-standard Planning Fee will apply when a request
includes DC power requirements other than 2-10, 2-20, 2-30, 2-40, 2-50, or 2-100 Amp
power feeds for Caged, Cageless, or Caged Common Collocation, or 2-100, 2-200, 2-300,
or 2-400 Amp power feeds for Adjacent On-Site Collocation, or other than integrated

ground plane, or when floor space requirements are greater than four hundred (400)
square feet. Requests for additions to the initial request, such as the addition of
Collocator provided equipment that requires AT&T-13STATE to engineer and purchase
additional equipment will result in a Subsequent Planning Fee. A major revision to the
initial request for Physical Collocation that changes floor space requirements, cable
entrance facilities requirements, or changes DC Power Distribution will be considered a
total revision and result in the reapplication of an initial Planning Fee. Rates and charges
are as found in the Collocation Rate Summary.
18.2.2 Billing for Caged Shared and Caged Common Collocation Arrangements
18.2.2.1 Except for certain charges identified as related to Caged Shared Collocation, each
Collocator shall be billed separately and shall be able to order and provision separately.
In the case of Caged Shared Collocation, AT&T-13STATE shall bill the original Collocator
for space. However, AT&T-13STATE shall bill the other Collocators in the shared cage
for use of Network Elements and interconnection separately as required. Collocators
located in a Caged Common Collocation area shall have direct billing arrangements with
AT&T-13STATE for floor space and all other applicable interconnection arrangements.
18.2.3 Floor Space Charges
18.2.3.1 Caged Collocation
18.2.3.1.1 The Caged Collocation option provides the Collocator with an individual
enclosure (not including a top). This enclosure is an area designated by
AT&T-13STATE within an Eligible Structure to be used by the Collocator for
the sole purpose of installing, maintaining and operating the Collocator-
provided equipment.
18.2.3.1.2 AT&T-13STATE will provide Floor Space, floor space site conditioning, Cage
Common Systems Materials, Cage Preparation and Safety and Security
charges in increments of one (1) square foot. For this reason, Collocator will
be able to order space and a cage enclosure in amounts as small as that
sufficient to house and maintain a single rack or bay of equipment (i.e., fifty
(50) square feet of cage space), and will ensure that the first Collocator in
AT&T-13STATE premises will not be responsible for the entire cost of site
preparation and security. In the case of Caged Shared Collocation, AT&T-
13STATE shall bill the original Collocator for space. Collocators located in a
Caged Common Collocation area shall have direct billing arrangements with
AT&T-13STATE for floor space and all other applicable interconnection
arrangements. When a Collocator constructs its own cage and related
equipment, the Collocator will not be subject to the Cage Preparation Charge
as set forth in Section 18.2.3.1.4.5 following. See Section 21, CDOW for
applicable charges.
18.2.3.1.3 In addition, terms and conditions for contractors performing cage construction
activities as set forth in Section 16 preceding will apply.
18.2.3.1.4 If the Collocator elects to install, or requests that AT&T-13STATE provide and
install a point of termination (POT) frame in the dedicated collocation area
rather than inside its cage, the floor space rate for Cageless Collocation found
in the Collocation Rate Summary applies.

total amount of DC amps provided over one of the two power feeds ordered by the Collocator for
its power arrangement. By way of example, where Collocator orders DC Power in a 20-amp
increment, it will be considered to have ordered two (2) twenty (20)-amp power feeds and AT&T
will provision two (2) twenty (20) amp DC power feeds (for a combined total of forty (40) amps), but
AT&T shall only bill Collocator the monthly recurring charge applicable to DC Power for a total of
twenty (20) amps. The DC power charge per amp consists of the use of: DC power plant, backup
generator, batteries & rectifiers, BDFB, associated hardware and cabling, and AC energy to
convert to DC power.
18.3.2 Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
18.3.2.1 This monthly recurring charge consists of the elements necessary to provide HVAC within
the Eligible Structure to the collocation arrangement and is based on the heat dissipation
required for each ten (10) amps of DC Power. This is a monthly recurring charge which is
determined by dividing the per each ten (10) amps of DC Power rate by the total amount
of DC amps provided over one of the two power feeds ordered by the Collocator for its
power arrangement. By way of example, where Collocator orders DC Power in a twenty
(20)-amp increment, it will be considered to have ordered two (2) twenty (20)-amp power
feeds and AT&T-13STATE will provision two (2) twenty (20) amp DC power feeds (for a
combined total of forty (40) amps), but AT&T-13STATE shall only bill Collocator the
monthly recurring charge applicable to HVAC on a total of twenty (20) amps. Charges for

Collocation Arrangement, Collocator Assignee represents warrants and agrees that it has obtained
an executed sale or lease agreement for and holds proper title to all non-AT&T-13STATE
equipment and other items in or otherwise associated with each Physical Collocation Arrangement.
Collocator Assignee further agrees to indemnify and hold the AT&T-13STATE harmless from any
third-party claims involving allegations that Collocator Assignee does not hold proper title to such
non-AT&T-13STATE equipment and other items.
19.3.6 AT&T-13STATE will respond to the Physical Collocation Application within ten (10) calendar days
of submission of the completed application, including provision of a price quote. Collocator
Assignee must pay one-hundred percent (100%) of all non-recurring charges in the price quote
before AT&T-13STATE begins to convert the Physical Collocation Arrangement being reassigned.
Once Collocator Assignee has paid one-hundred percent (100%) of all such non-recurring charges,
the AT&T-13STATE shall finish the work to convert the space within thirty (30) calendar days.
AT&T-13STATE and Collocator Assignee will coordinate all conversion work to insure that the end
user customers of Collocator Assignee do not suffer disruptions of service.
19.3.7 Collocator Assignee may submit a security application for access to a Physical Collocation
Arrangement simultaneously with the Physical Collocation Application. If a completed security
application is provided at the time the Collocation Application is filed, the security cards will be
made available at the time that the collocation space is turned over. If the security application is
not provided at the time that the Collocation Application is filed, then Collocator Assignee may
submit a security application for access at any time and the terms and conditions as provided in
Section 18.3.6 will apply. In no event will the security cards be provided to the Collocator Assignee
before the assigned space is turned over.
19.3.8 Collocator Assignee assumes each Physical Collocation Arrangement “as is” which means that
AT&T-13STATE will make no changes to the Physical Collocation Arrangement, including no
changes to power, interconnection and entrance facilities. Any modifications to such Physical
Collocation Arrangement by Collocator Assignee must be submitted via a separate augment
application (or as otherwise provided by the applicable ICA).
19.3.9 This Section 19.3 does not affect any obligations arising outside of this Collocation Agreement.
19.4 Power Reduction
19.4.1 The Collocator may request to decrease the amount of existing power available to a Physical
Collocation Arrangement. This can be done either by disconnecting and removing a power cable
feed or by replacing the existing fuse with a fuse of a lower breakdown rating on a power cable
feed. If the Collocator desires to disconnect a power arrangement (A&B feed), the Collocator will
be responsible for paying the costs to remove the A&B power cable feeds that make up the power
arrangement. If the Collocator desires to reduce the amperage on a power cable feed, the
Collocator will be responsible for paying the costs necessary to change the fuse that serves the
A&B feeds at the AT&T-13STATE power source. In either case, the Collocator must maintain a
minimum amount of power on at least one power arrangement (A&B feed) to service their Physical
Collocation Arrangement when submitting their power reduction request. The Collocator shall
submit an augment application in order to process this request.
19.4.2 If the Collocator desires to only reduce the fuse capacity on an existing power arrangement (A&B
feed) rather than disconnect and remove cable to an existing power arrangement, they may only
reduce the fuse size to the lowest power amp increment offered in this Appendix referenced in
Section 18.3.3.1. Different minimum amp increments apply for power arrangements fed from either
an AT&T-13STATE BDFB or a AT&T-13STATE Power Plant. When the Collocator is requesting
to reduce the fuse capacity only, the fees referenced in Section 19.9 will apply. When the
Collocator has only one power arrangement (A&B feed) serving their Physical Collocation
Arrangement, a fuse reduction is the only power reduction option available to the Collocator.
19.4.3 When a power reduction request involves a fuse change only on a power arrangement serviced
from the AT&T-13STATE BDFB (i.e. power arrangements less than or equal to a fifty (50) amp A
Page 112 of 551

APPENDIX PHYSICAL COLLOCATION/AT&T-13STATE

feed and a fifty (50) amp B feed) the Collocator must hire an AT&T-13STATE Approved Tier 1
Vendor to coordinate fuse changes at the AT&T-13STATE BDFB. Applicable fees referenced in
Section 19.9 will still apply. When a power reduction request involves a fuse change on a power
arrangement serviced from the AT&T-13STATE Power Plant (i.e. power arrangements consisting
of a one-hundred (100) amp A feed and a one-hundred (100) amp B feed and above), the AT&T-
13STATE shall coordinate the fuse changes at the AT&T-13STATE Power Plant.
19.4.4 When a power reduction request requires disconnecting and removing a power cable feed from
either the AT&T-13STATE’s BDFB or Power Plant, the AT&T-13STATE approved Tier 1 Vendor
will perform the power cable removal work above the rack level (cable mining). Applicable fees
referenced in Section 19.8 will apply. Within thirty (30) days after submitting its power reduction
request to disconnect and remove a power arrangement, the Collocator must perform the following
activity:
(A) Remove terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to the AT&T-
13STATE rack level. Collocator must use a AT&T-13STATE approved Tier 1
Installation/Removal Vendor for this procedure and that vendor must follow TP76300
guidelines for cutting and capping the cable at the rack level.
19.4.5 When the Collocator has multiple power arrangement serving a Physical Collocation Arrangement
(i.e., one power arrangement consisting of fifty (50) amps on the A feed and fifty (50) amps on the
B feed and a second power arrangement consisting of twenty (20) amps on the A feed and twenty
(20) amps on the B feed), the Collocator has the option of either fusing down the fifty (50) amp
power arrangement (A&B feed) or disconnecting and removing the power cable feed from the fifty
(50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed). If the Collocator chooses to disconnect and remove the
power cable feed from a power arrangement (A&B feed), then the charges referenced in Section
19.8 will apply. If the Collocator has multiple power arrangements (A&B feed) where they can
request both a fuse reduction and a power cable removal for one Physical Collocation
Arrangement [i.e. reduce one power arrangement from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to twenty (20)

cabling. AT&T-13STATE will notify Collocator as to whether its request for space is granted or
denied due to a lack of space within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of a Collocator’s accurate
and complete Physical Collocation Application. If AT&T-13STATE determines that Collocator’s
Physical Collocation Application is unacceptable, AT&T-13STATE shall advise Collocator of any
deficiencies within this ten (10) calendar day period. AT&T-13STATE shall provide Collocator with
sufficient detail so that Collocator has a reasonable opportunity to cure each deficiency. To retain
its place in the queue to obtain the Physical Collocation arrangement, Collocator must cure any
deficiencies in its Application and resubmit such Application within ten (10) calendar days after
being advised of deficiencies. Any changes to the amount or type of floor space, interconnection
terminations, and power requested from the originally submitted Physical Collocation Application
will not be considered a deficiency. If these types of changes are requested while application is in
queue, the application will be rejected.
21.5.2 The delivery interval relates to the period in which AT&T-13STATE shall construct and turnover to
the Collocator’s the requested Physical Collocation Space. The delivery interval begins on the
date AT&T-13STATE receives an accurate and complete Physical Collocation Application from the

APPENDIX VIRTUAL COLLOCATION
1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
1.1 This Section of the Appendix provides for Virtual Collocation for the purpose of interconnecting to
AT&T-13STATE for the transmission and routing of Telephone Exchange Service and Exchange
Access pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251 (c)(2), and for access to AT&T-13STATE’s Lawful Unbundled
Network Elements (“Lawful UNEs”) pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(3) of the Act when the virtually
collocated telecommunications equipment (hereafter referred to as equipment) is provided by the
Collocator.
1.2 The Parties intend that this Appendix contain the sole and exclusive terms and conditions by which
CLEC will obtain Virtual Collocation from AT&T-13STATE pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(6). Except
as may be specifically permitted by this Appendix, and then only to the extent permitted, CLEC and its
affiliated entities hereby fully and irrevocably waive any right or ability any of them might have to
purchase Virtual Collocation directly from any AT&T-13STATE tariff, and agree not to so purchase or
attempt to so purchase from any AT&T-13STATE tariff that provides for 251(c)(6) Virtual Collocation.
Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel,
laches, or similar concepts in other situations, the failure of AT&T-13STATE to enforce the foregoing
(including if AT&T-13STATE fails to reject or otherwise block applications for, or provides or continues
to provide, 251(c)(6) Virtual Collocation under tariff to CLEC or any of its affiliated entities) shall not act
as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not act to
affect any rights or requirements hereunder. At its option, AT&T-13STATE may either reject any
application or order for 251(c)(6) Virtual Collocation submitted under tariff, or without the need for any
further contact with or consent from CLEC, AT&T-13STATE may process any order for any 251(c)(6)
Virtual Collocation submitted under tariff, as being submitted under this Appendix and, further, may
convert any 251(c)(6) Virtual Collocation provided under tariff, to this Appendix, effective as of the later
in time of the (i) Effective Date of this Agreement/Amendment, or (ii) the submission of the order by
CLEC.
1.3 Upon request from a Collocator, AT&T-13STATE will provide one of the following maintenance
alternates for its Virtual Collocation offering:
1.3.1 In all of AT&T-13STATE's premises, AT&T-13STATE will offer Virtual Collocation wherein
AT&T-13STATE maintains and repairs the virtually collocated equipment consistent with the
rates, terms and conditions as provided for in Sections 1 through 17 of this Appendix.
1.3.2 In Controlled Environmental Vault (CEV), huts and cabinets where Physical Collocation space is
not available, a Collocator may opt for Virtual Collocation wherein the Collocator maintains and
repairs the virtually collocated equipment as described in Section 17 following and consistent
with the rates, terms and conditions as provided for throughout this entire Appendix. AT&T-
13STATE may at its option, elect to offer this maintenance alternative in one or more of its
Central Offices, and in one or more of its CEVs, huts and cabinets where Physical Collocation
space is available. As described in Section 17, this maintenance alternative is contingent on the
provision of a security escort paid for by the Collocator. In the event the FCC determines that
AT&T-13STATE may not require a security escort paid for by the Collocator, then this Virtual
Collocation maintenance alternative as described in this Section and in Section 17is null and
void and all Virtual Collocation will be maintained as described in Section 1 above.
1.4 Virtual Collocation in the Central Office is available for interconnection with AT&T-13STATE for the
transmission and routing of Telephone Exchange Service and Exchange Access as well as AT&T-
13STATE provided Lawful UNEs. Virtual Collocation in CEVs, huts and cabinets is available for

the Agreement. Lawful UNEs including associated cross connects are obtained from the Agreement
between the Collocator and AT&T-13STATE. Cross connects associated with Lawful UNEs establish
the circuit between the virtually collocated equipment, and these cross connects are the point at which
services provided and purchased from the Agreement begin. Virtually collocated equipment is available
as follows:
1.10.1 A Collocator shall purchase from the vendor the equipment to be virtually collocated subject to
the provisions as set forth below and the equipment conforming to industry safety standards as
described in AT&T-13STATE’s Technical Publication https://clec.att.com/clec/.
1.10.2 In accordance with Section 251(c)(6) of the Act, the Collocator may collocate equipment for
Virtual Collocation if such equipment is necessary for interconnection to AT&T-13STATE under
47.U.S.C. § 251(c)(2) or accessing AT&T-13STATE’s Lawful UNEs under 47.U.S.C. § 251(c)
(3) of the FTA 96. For purposes of this Section, "necessary" means directly related to and thus
necessary, required, or indispensable to interconnection or access to Lawful UNEs. Such uses
are limited to interconnection to AT&T-13STATE's network "for the transmission and routing of
Telephone Exchange Service or Exchange Access," or for access to AT&T-13STATE's Lawful
UNEs "for the provision of a telecommunications service."
1.10.3 Equipment that may be collocated solely for these purposes includes: (1) transmission
equipment including, but not limited to, optical terminating equipment and multiplexers; and (2)
equipment being collocated to terminate basic transmission facilities pursuant to sections
64.1401 and 64.1402 of 47 C.F.R. (Expanded Interconnection) as of August 1, 1996. AT&T-
13STATE is not required nor shall it permit the collocation of stand-alone switches or enhanced

1.10.5 AT&T-13STATE does not allow collocation of other Multifunctional Equipment, except that
AT&T-13STATE will voluntarily allow collocation of REMOTE SWITCH MODULE (RSM) solely
under the following conditions: (1) the REMOTE SWITCH MODULE (RSM) may not be used
as a stand-alone switch; it must report back to and be controlled by a Collocator identified host
switch and direct trunking to the REMOTE SWITCH MODULE (RSM) will not be permitted; (2)
the REMOTE SWITCH MODULE (RSM) equipment must be used only for the purpose of
interconnection with AT&T-13STATE’s network for the transmission and routing of Telephone
Exchange Service or Exchange Access or for access to AT&T-13STATE’s Lawful UNEs for the
provision of a telecommunications service. AT&T-13STATE voluntarily will allow Collocator to
collocate, on a non-discriminatory basis, other multi-functional equipment only if AT&T-
13STATE and Collocator mutually agree to such collocation.
1.10.6 For purposes of this Section, "Multifunctional Equipment" means equipment that has (1)
functions that make the equipment "necessary for interconnection or access to Lawful UNEs"
and (2) additional functions that are not "necessary" for these purposes. Such additional
functions include, but are not limited to, switching and enhanced service functions. AT&T-
13STATE will not allow collocation of stand-alone switching equipment or any enhanced
services equipment.
1.10.7 AT&T-13STATE voluntarily allows Collocator to place ancillary equipment, including cross-
connect and other simple frames, routers, portable test equipment, equipment racks and bays,
and other ancillary equipment on a non-discriminatory basis only if AT&T-13STATE and
Collocator mutually agree to such placement, in AT&T-13STATE's premises solely to support
and be used with equipment that the Collocator has legitimately collocated in the same
premises.
1.10.8 Pending the FCC's reasonably timely remand proceedings in accordance with the Court's
Opinion in GTE Service Corporation v. FCC, No. 99-1176, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 4111 (D.C.
Cir. March 17, 2000) ("GTE Opinion"), AT&T-13STATE voluntarily will not disturb (1) equipment
and (2) connection arrangements between different Collocators' equipment in an AT&T-
13STATE Eligible Premises, that prior to the May 11, 2000, effective date of the GTE Opinion,
were (1) in place in AT&T-13STATE or (2) requested by Collocator and accepted by AT&T-
13STATE on the same basis as under the FCC's original, pre-vacated Collocation Order
(Deployment of Wireline Services Offering Advanced Telecommunications Capability, CC
Docket No. 98-147, First Report and Order (FCC 99-48), 14 FCC Rcd 4761 (1999)). AT&T-
13STATE’s agreement not to disturb these collocation arrangements pending timely completion
of the remand proceedings will immediately expire if a federal or state court or regulatory
agency attempts to apply any of the most favored nation provisions of the Act, of any state
Merger Conditions, or of the FCC AT&T/Ameritech Merger Conditions to such arrangements or
deems such arrangements to be discriminatory vis-à-vis other carriers.
1.10.9 All types of network equipment placed in AT&T-13STATE network equipment areas of Eligible
Structures by AT&T-13STATE or Collocator must meet AT&T-13STATE minimum safety
standards. The minimum safety standards are as follows: (1) Collocator’s equipment must
meet Telcordia Level 1 safety requirements as set forth in Telcordia documents SR-3580 and
GR-63-CORE, Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS); or, (2) Collocator must
demonstrate that its equipment has a history of safe operation defined by installation in an ILEC
(including AT&T-13STATE) prior to January 1, 1998 with no known history of safety problems.
The Collocator will be expected to conform to the same accepted procedures and standards
utilized by including AT&T-13STATE and its contractors when engineering and installing

1.10.10 In the event that AT&T-13STATE denied Collocation of Collocator's equipment, citing Safety
Standards, AT&T-13STATE will provide within five (5) business days of Collocator's written
request to AT&T-13STATE representative(s), a list of AT&T-13STATE equipment placed since
January 1, 1998 within the network areas of the Eligible Premise for which Collocation was
denied together with an affidavit attesting that all of such AT&T-13STATE equipment met or
exceeded the then current Safety Standards when such equipment was placed in the Eligible
Premise.
1.10.11 In the event AT&T-13STATE believes that collocated equipment is not necessary for
interconnection or access to Lawful UNEs or determines that the Collocator’s equipment does
not meet the minimum safety standards, the Collocator must not collocate the equipment unless
and until the dispute is resolved in its favor. The Collocator will be given ten (10) business days
to comply with the requirements and/or remove the equipment from the collocation space if the
equipment already improperly was collocated. If the Parties do not resolve the dispute pursuant
to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the Agreement, AT&T-13STATE or Collocator
may file a complaint at the Commission seeking a formal resolution of the dispute. If it is
determined that the Collocator's equipment does not meet the minimum safety standards
above, the Collocator must not collocate the equipment and will be responsible for removal of
the equipment and all resulting damages if the equipment already was collocated improperly.
1.10.12 Regarding safety, Collocator equipment or operating practices representing a significant
demonstrable technical or physical threat to AT&T-13STATE's personnel, network or facilities,
including the Eligible Structure, or those of others are strictly prohibited. Regarding safety, and
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the characteristics and methods of operation of any
equipment or facilities placed in the Virtual Collocation space shall not create hazards for or
cause damage to those facilities, the Virtual Collocation space, or the Eligible Structure in which
the Virtual Collocation space is located; impair the privacy of any communications carried in,
from, or through the Eligible Structure in which the Virtual Collocation space is located; or
create hazards or cause physical harm to any individual or the public. Any of the foregoing
would be in violation of this Appendix. Disputes regarding proper implementation of operating
practices or technical standards may be resolved under the standards of Sections 1.12.3 of this
Appendix.
1.11 A Collocator may arrange for a mutually agreed upon vendor/contractor to engineer and install the
virtually collocated equipment the Collocator purchases and the Collocator may pay the
vendor/contractor directly. The installation contractor and their activity will be under the direction and
control of Collocator who will ensure that the installation contractor meets all standards and
requirements for installation of equipment, as required under this Appendix. If AT&T-13STATE
chooses to have its personnel present when the CLEC equipment is installed, then AT&T-13STATE’s
presence will be at its own expense. However, if AT&T-13STATE demonstrates that the CLEC
contractor has or would have violated any standard or requirement for installation of equipment, as
required under this Appendix, the CLEC is responsible for the quantifiable expense incurred by AT&T-
13STATE.

performed which will benefit or be used by AT&T-13STATE or other collocators. AT&T-13STATE also
may not impose a Custom Work Charge without the Collocator’s approval and agreement that the
custom work is not included in the provision of collocation as provided for in the rate elements
contained in this Appendix. In the event an agreement between the Collocator and AT&T-13STATE is
not reached regarding the Custom Work Charge, AT&T-13STATE shall complete construction of the
Collocator’s space pending resolution of the issue by the appropriate Commission and the Collocator
may withhold payment for the disputed charges while the issue remains unresolved; however, any
disputed Custom Work Charges paid by the Collocator or owed to AT&T-13STATE shall accrue
interest at the rate established by the appropriate Commission. All Custom Work Charges that are
approved by the appropriate Commission will be the basis for calculating a refund to a Collocator that
has overpaid or the amount due to AT&T-13STATE that was not paid or underpaid. These overpaid or
underpaid amounts will accrue at the above-stated interest rate on a monthly basis from the date of
completion of the work or the date of payment of the disputed amount, as appropriate. In the event that
the requested work will benefit all or most collocators, such work shall not be considered custom work;
instead, AT&T-13STATE shall file the appropriate interconnection agreement amendment. However,
AT&T-13STATE shall not delay completion of such work during the agreement approval process.
AT&T-13STATE shall perform such work based upon provisional rates, subject to true up.
2.7 Day - For purposes of application and/or installation intervals, “day” denotes calendar days unless
otherwise specified. However, any time period equal to or less than five days, day denotes business
day.
2.8 Dedicated Space - Denotes the space dedicated for the Collocator’s Physical Collocation arrangement
located in AT&T-13STATE Eligible Structure.
2.9 Eligible Structure - Eligible Structure refers to AT&T-13STATE's Central Offices and serving wire
centers, as well as all buildings or similar structures owned or leased by AT&T-13STATE that house its
network facilities, and all structures that house AT&T-13STATE's facilities on public rights-of-way,
including but not limited to vaults containing loop concentrators or similar structures.
2.10 Infrastructure Systems - The structural components, such as floors capable of supporting equipment
loads, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, electrical systems, power, high
efficiency filtration, humidity controls, remote alarms, compartmentation and smoke purge.
2.11 Legitimately Exhausted - Denotes when all space in a Central Office (CO) or other Eligible Structure
that can be used to locate telecommunications equipment in any of the methods of collocation available
under this Appendix is exhausted or completely occupied. Before AT&T-13STATE may make a
determination that space in an Eligible Structure is legitimately exhausted, AT&T-13STATE must have
removed all unused obsolete equipment from the Eligible Structure and made such space available for
collocation; however, removal of the equipment shall not cause a delay in AT&T-13STATE’s response
to a Collocator’s application or in provisioning collocation arrangements. The determination of
exhaustion is subject to dispute resolution as provided in Appendix General Terms & Conditions,
Section 10. In making this determination, AT&T-13STATE may reserve space for transport equipment
for current year plus two years. Additionally, AT&T-13STATE may not reserve space for equipment for
itself, or advanced or interLATA services affiliates or other affiliates of AT&T-13STATE or for future use
by AT&T-13STATE or its affiliates under conditions that are more favorable than those that apply to
other telecommunications carriers seeking to reserve collocation space for their own use. AT&T-
13STATE may reserve space for Switching, Power, Main Distribution Frame (MDF), and Digital Cross

trunk group specific to the underlying technology. In addition, 911 traffic originating in one
(1) NPA (area code) must be transmitted over a separate 911 trunk group from 911 traffic
originating in any other NPA (area code) 911.
4.2.4 CLEC shall maintain facility transport capacity sufficient to route 911 traffic over trunks dedicated for
911 interconnection between the CLEC switch and the AT&T-13STATE Selective Router.
4.2.5 CLEC shall provide sufficient trunking to route CLEC's originating 911 calls to the designated AT&T-
13STATE 911 Selective Router.
4.2.6 A diverse (i.e. separate) 911 Trunk is recommended and may be required by the E911 Customer. If
required by the E911 Customer, diverse 911 Trunks shall be ordered in the same fashion as the
primary 911 Trunks. CLEC is responsible for initiating trunking and facility orders for diverse routes
for 911 interconnection.
4.2.7 CLEC is responsible for determining the proper quantity of trunks and transport facilities from its
switch(es) to interconnect with the AT&T-13STATE 911 Selective Router.

“busy day/busy hour” criteria or, if higher, at such other minimum grade of service as required by
Applicable Law.
4.2.9 CLEC shall monitor its 911 trunks for the purpose of determining originating network traffic volumes.
If CLEC's traffic study indicates that additional 911 trunks are needed to meet the current level of
911 call volumes, CLEC shall provision additional 911 trunks for interconnection with AT&T-
13STATE.

implementation schedule. AT&T-12STATE agrees to develop a cutover plan and project manage the
cutovers with CLEC participation and agreement.
4. TANDEM TRUNKING AND DIRECT END OFFICE TRUNKING
4.1 AT&T-13STATE deploys in its network Local Only Tandem Switches (AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE and AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE), Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switches (AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE) Local/Access Tandem Switches and Access Tandem Switches. In
addition AT&T-13STATE deploys Tandems that switch ancillary traffic such as E911 (E911 Tandem or
E911 Selective Routing Tandem), Operator Services/ Directory Assistance (OS/DA Tandem), and Mass
Calling (choke Tandem).
4.2 CLEC shall establish Local Only or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to all Local Tandems in the LATA
in which CLEC Offers Service in AT&T CONNECTICUT, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, and AT&T-
2STATE. If CLEC Offers Service in a LATA in which there is no AT&T Local Tandem, CLEC shall establish
Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to each AT&T-13STATE End Office Switch in that LATA in which it
Offers Service. CLEC shall establish Local Only or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to all Local
Tandems in the local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service in AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE. If there are no Local Tandems in the local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service in the
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, CLEC shall establish a Local Interconnection Trunk Group to
each AT&T-13STATE End Office Switch in that local exchange area in which CLEC Offers Service. CLEC
shall route appropriate traffic (i.e. only traffic to End Offices that subtend that Local Tandem) to the
respective AT&T-13STATE Local Tandem on the trunk groups defined below. AT&T-13STATE shall route
appropriate traffic to CLEC switches on the trunk groups defined below.
4.3 Direct End Office Trunk Group(s) (DEOTs) transport Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic between
CLEC’s switch and an AT&T-13STATE End Office and are not switched at a Local Tandem location.
CLEC shall establish a two-way Direct End Office Trunk Group (one-way in AT&T CONNECTICUT) when
actual or projected End Office Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic requires twenty-four (24) or more
trunks. Once provisioned, traffic from CLEC to AT&T-13STATE must be redirected to route first to the
DEOT with overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate AT&T-13STATE Local Tandem. If an AT&T-
13STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T-13STATE Local Tandem, a direct final Direct End Office
Trunk Group will be established by CLEC, and there will be no overflow of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic.
4.4 All traffic received by AT&T-13STATE on the DEOT from CLEC must terminate in the End Office, i.e. no
Tandem switching will be performed in the End Office. Where End Office functionality is provided in a
Remote End Office Switch of a host/remote configuration, CLEC shall establish the DEOT at the host
switch. The number of digits to be received by the AT&T-13STATE End Office shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties. This trunk group shall be two-way (one-way in AT&T CONNECTICUT).
4.5 Trunk Configuration
4.5.1 Trunk Configuration – AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT
4.5.1.1 Where available and upon the request of the other Party, each Party shall cooperate to
ensure that its trunk groups are configured utilizing the Bipolar 8 Zero Substitution Extended
Super Frame (B8ZS ESF) protocol for 64 kbps Clear Channel Capability (64CCC)
transmission to allow for ISDN interoperability between the Parties’ respective networks.
Trunk groups configured for 64CCC and carrying Circuit Switched Data (CSD) ISDN calls
shall carry the appropriate Trunk Type Modifier in the CLCI-Message code. Trunk groups
configured for 64CCC and not used to carry CSD ISDN calls shall carry a different
appropriate Trunk Type Modifier in the CLCI-Message code.
4.5.1.2 Any AT&T-13STATE switch incapable of handling 64CCC traffic will require that Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups be established at those switches using Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI).

4.5.2 Trunk Configuration – AT&T-2STATE
4.5.2.1 When Interconnecting at AT&T-2STATE’s digital End Offices, the Parties have a preference
for use of Bipolar 8 Zero Substitution Extended Super Frame (B8ZS ESF) two-way trunks for
all traffic between their networks. Where available, such trunk equipment will be used for
Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. Where AMI trunks are used, either Party may request
upgrade to B8ZS ESF when such equipment is available.
4.5.2.2 When interconnecting at AT&T CALIFORNIA’s DMS Access Tandem(s), 64CCC data and
voice traffic may be combined on the same two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group. 64
CCC data and voice traffic must be on separate two-way Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups and not combined at AT&T CALIFORNIA’s 4E Access Tandems.
5. TRUNK GROUPS
5.1 When CLEC Offers Service in a Local Exchange Area or LATA, the following trunk groups shall be used to
exchange various types of traffic between CLEC End Users and AT&T-13STATE End Users.
5.2 Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each Local Exchange Area: AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE.
5.2.1 A two-way Local Only Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch in the local exchange area. Inter-
Tandem switching is not provided.
5.2.2 A two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC switch and each
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switch and each Local/Access
Tandem Switch in the local exchange area. Inter-Tandem switching is not provided.
5.2.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE reserves the right to initiate a one-way IntraLATA Trunk
Group to CLEC in order to provide Tandem relief when a community of interest is outside the local
exchange area in which CLEC is interconnected.
5.2.4 Where traffic from CLEC switch to an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office is
sufficient (24 or more trunks), a Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall also be established to the
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office.
5.2.5 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC switch to each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office in a local exchange area that has no Local Tandem.
This trunk group shall be established as a direct final.
5.2.6 When AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has a separate Local Only Tandem Switch(es) in the
local exchange area, and a separate Access Tandem Switch that serves the same local exchange
area, a two-way IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group shall be established to the AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE Access Tandem Switch. In addition a two-way Local Only Trunk Group(s) shall
be established from CLEC’s switch to each AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only
Tandem Switch.

subtend the designated tandem. These trunk groups shall be two-way and will
utilize Signaling System (SS7) signaling.
5.3.1.1.2 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups established at all AT&T Local/IntraLATA, Local/Access, or Access
Tandem Switch(es) (AT&T-2STATE only) in the LATA for calls destined to or
from all AT&T-2STATE and AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE End Offices
that subtend the designated tandems. These trunk groups shall be two-way and
will utilize Signaling System (SS7) signaling.
5.3.2 Tandem Trunking – AT&T CONNECTICUT
5.3.2.1 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups established at all AT&T Local Tandems in the LATA for calls
destined to or from all AT&T CONNECTICUT End Offices that subtend the designated
tandem. These trunk groups shall be one-way and will utilize Signaling System 7 (SS7)
signaling.
5.3.3 Direct End Office Trunking
5.3.3.1 The Parties shall establish Direct End Office Trunk Groups for the exchange of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic where actual or projected traffic demand is or will be twenty-
four (24) or more trunks.
5.4 Meet Point Trunk Group: AT&T-13STATE
5.4.1 IXC carried traffic shall be transported between CLEC’s switch and the AT&T-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch over a Meet Point Trunk Group separate from
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The Meet Point Trunk Group will be established for the
transmission and routing of exchange access traffic between CLEC’s End Users and IXCs via a
AT&T-13STATE Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
5.4.2 Meet Point Trunk Groups shall be provisioned as two-way and will utilize SS7 signaling, except
multifrequency (“MF”) signaling will be used on a separate Meet Point Trunk Group to complete
originating calls to switched access customers that use MF FGD signaling protocol.
5.4.3 When AT&T-13STATE has more than one Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch in a local
exchange area or LATA, CLEC shall establish a Meet Point Trunk Group to every AT&T-13STATE
Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch where CLEC has homed its NXX code(s).
5.4.4 AT&T-13STATE will not block switched access customer traffic delivered to any AT&T-13STATE
Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch for completion on CLEC’s network. The
Parties understand and agree that Meet Point trunking arrangements are available and functional
only to/from switched access customers who directly connect with any AT&T-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch that CLEC’s switch subtends in each LATA. In no
event will AT&T-13STATE be required to route such traffic through more than one of its tandem
switches for connection to/from switched access customers. AT&T-13STATE shall have no
responsibility to ensure that any switched access customer will accept traffic that CLEC directs to the
switched access customer.
5.4.5 CLEC shall provide all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, charge number and
originating line information ("OLI"). For terminating FGD, AT&T-13STATE will pass all SS7 signaling
information including, without limitation, CPN if it receives CPN from FGD carriers. All privacy
indicators will be honored. Where available, network signaling information such as transit network
selection ("TNS") parameter, carrier identification codes (“CIC”) (CCS platform) and CIC/OZZ
information (non-SS7 environment) will be provided by CLEC wherever such information is needed
for call routing or billing. The Parties will follow all OBF adopted standards pertaining to TNS and
CIC/OZZ codes.

5.5 800/(8YY) Traffic: AT&T-13STATE
5.5.1 If CLEC chooses AT&T-13STATE to handle 800/(8YY) database queries from its switches, all CLEC
originating 800/(8YY) traffic will be routed over the Meet Point Trunk Group. This traffic will include a
combination of both Interexchange Carrier (IXC) 800/(8YY) service and CLEC 800/(8YY) service
that will be identified and segregated by carrier through the database query handled through the
AT&T-13STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
5.5.2 All originating Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC requests that AT&T-13STATE
perform the Service Switching Point (“SSP”) function (e.g. perform the database query) shall be
delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk Group. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit
Code (to be determined for each LATA) shall be used for all such calls.
5.5.3 CLEC may handle its own 800/(8YY) database queries from its switch. If so, CLEC will determine
the nature (local/intraLATA/interLATA) of the 800/(8YY) call based on the response from the
database. If the query determines that the call is a local or IntraLATA 800/(8YY) number, CLEC will
route the post-query local or IntraLATA converted ten-digit local number to AT&T-13STATE over the
Local Interconnection Trunk Group. In such case, CLEC is to provide an 800/(8YY) billing record
when appropriate. If the query reveals the call is an InterLATA 800/(8YY) number, CLEC will route
the post-query inter-LATA call (800/(8YY) number) directly from its switch for carriers interconnected
with its network or over the Meet Point Trunk Group to carriers not directly connected to its network
but are connected to AT&T-13STATE’s Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch. Calls will be
routed to AT&T-13STATE over the Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups or Meet
Point Trunk Groups within the LATA in which the calls originate.
5.5.4 All post-query Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC performs the SSP function, if
delivered to AT&T-13STATE, shall be delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk
Group for calls destined to IXCs, or shall be delivered by CLEC using GR-317 format over the Local
Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group for calls destined to End Offices that directly subtend
the tandem.
5.6 E911 Trunk Group
5.6.1 A dedicated trunk group for each NPA shall be established to each appropriate E911 switch within
the local exchange area or LATA in which CLEC Offers Service. This trunk group shall be
provisioned as one-way outgoing only and will utilize MF CAMA signaling or, where available, SS7
signaling. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this trunk group.
Where the parties utilize SS7 signaling and the E911 network has the technology available, only
one E911 trunk group shall be established to handle multiple NPAs within the local exchange area or
LATA. If the E911 network does not have the appropriate technology available, a SS7 trunk group
shall be established for each NPA in the local exchange area or LATA. CLEC shall provide a
minimum of two (2) one-way outgoing channels on E911 trunk groups per default PSAP or default
ESN assignment dedicated for originating E911 emergency service calls from the Point of
Interconnection (POI) to the AT&T-13STATE E911 Selective Router switch that serves a specified
geographic rate area.
5.6.2 In AT&T CONNECTICUT only, CLEC will comply with the CT DPUC directives regarding the E911
trunk groups. The current directive requires CLEC to establish three separate dedicated trunk
groups for each Connecticut NPA and default PSAP or default ESN assignment, from its switch to
each of the Connecticut E911 Selective Routing tandems. For each NPA, one trunk group using
SS7 signaling will go to the Primary E911 Selective Routing tandem. A second trunk group using
SS7 will go to the Secondary E911 Selective routing tandem. The third trunk group will have MF
CAMA signaling and will go to the Primary E911 Selective Routing tandem and serve as a backup.
These trunk groups shall be provisioned by CLEC as one-way outgoing only. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs.

5.6.3 CLEC will cooperate with AT&T-13STATE to promptly test all E911 trunks and facilities between
CLEC’s network and the AT&T-13STATE E911 Selective Routing Tandem to assure proper
functioning of E911 service. CLEC will not turn up live traffic until successful testing is completed by
both Parties.
5.7 High Volume Call In (HVCI) / Mass Calling (Choke) Trunk Group: AT&T-12STATE
5.7.1 A dedicated trunk group shall be required to the designated Public Response HVCI/Mass Calling
Network Access Tandem in each serving area. This trunk group shall be one-way outgoing only and
shall utilize MF signaling. As the HVCI/Mass Calling trunk group is designed to block all excessive
attempts toward HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs, it is necessarily exempt from the one percent blocking
standard described elsewhere for other final Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group. The Parties will
not exchange live traffic until successful testing is completed by both Parties.
5.7.2 This group shall be sized as follows:
Number of Access Lines Number of Mass Calling
Served Trunks
0 – 10,000 2
10,001 – 20,000 3
20,001 – 30,000 4
30,001 – 40,000 5
40,001 – 50,000 6
50,001 – 60,000 7
60,001 – 75,000 8
75,000 + 9 maximum
5.7.3 If CLEC should acquire a HVCI/Mass Calling customer, i.e. a radio station, CLEC shall notify AT&T-
12STATE at least 60 days in advance of the need to establish a one-way outgoing SS7 or MF trunk
group from the AT&T-12STATE HVCI/Mass Calling Serving Office to the CLEC customer’s serving
office. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
5.7.4 If CLEC finds it necessary to issue a new choke telephone number to a new or existing HVCI/Mass
Calling customer, CLEC may request a meeting to coordinate with AT&T-12STATE the assignment
of HVCI/Mass Calling telephone number from the existing choke NXX. In the event that the CLEC
establishes a new choke NXX, CLEC must notify AT&T-12STATE a minimum of ninety (90) days
prior to deployment of the new HVCI/Mass Calling NXX. AT&T-12STATE will perform the necessary
translations in its End Offices and Tandem(s) and issue ASRs to establish a one-way outgoing SS7
or MF trunk group from the AT&T-12STATE Public Response HVCI/Mass Calling Network Access
Tandem to CLEC’s choke serving office.
5.7.5 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, where HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs have not been established, the Parties
agree to utilize “call gapping” as the method to control high volumes of calls, where technically
feasible in the originating switch, to specific high volume customers or in situations such as those
described in Section 35 Network Maintenance and Management of the General Terms and
Conditions.
5.8 Operator Services/Directory Assistance Trunk Group(s)
5.8.1 Terms and Conditions for Inward Assistance Operator Services are found in Appendix INW.
5.8.2 If AT&T-13STATE agrees through a separate appendix or contract to provide Directory Assistance
and/or Operator Services for CLEC the following trunk groups are required:

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
5.8.2.1 Directory Assistance (DA)
5.8.2.1.1 CLEC may contract for DA services only. A segregated trunk group for these
services will be required to the appropriate AT&T-13STATE Operator Services
Tandem in the LATA for the NPA the CLEC wishes to serve. This trunk group is
provisioned as one-way outgoing only and utilizes Modified Operator Services
Signaling (2 Digit Automatic Number Identification (ANI)). CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
5.8.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC)
5.8.2.2.1 CLEC contracting for DA services may also contract for DACC. This requires a
segregated one-way trunk group to each AT&T-13STATE Operator Services
Tandem within the LATA for the combined DA and DACC traffic. This trunk group
is provisioned as one-way outgoing only and utilizes Modified Operator Services
Signaling (2 Digit ANI). CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
5.8.2.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI)
5.8.2.3.1 When AT&T-13STATE’s operator is under contract to verify the busy status of
CLEC End Users, AT&T-13STATE will utilize a segregated one-way with MF
signaling trunk group from AT&T-13STATE’s Operator Services Tandem to
CLEC switch. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing
ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
5.8.2.4 Operator Assistance (0+, 0-)
5.8.2.4.1 This service requires a one-way trunk group from CLEC switch to AT&T-
13STATE’s Operator Services Tandem. Two types of trunk groups may be
utilized. If the trunk group transports DA/DACC, the trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate traffic use code and modifier. If DA is not required
or is transported on a segregated trunk group, then the group will be designated
with a different appropriate traffic use code and modifier. Modified Operator
Services Signaling (2 Digit ANI) will be required on the trunk group. CLEC will
have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
5.8.2.5 Digit-Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling
5.8.2.5.1 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from
the equal access End Offices (EAEO) to the Operator Services switch that are
equipped to accept 10 Digit Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
5.8.2.6 OS Questionnaire
5.8.2.6.1 If CLEC chooses AT&T-13STATE to provide either OS and/or DA, then CLEC
agrees to accurately complete the OS Questionnaire prior to submitting ASRs for
OS and DA trunks.
6. TRUNK FORECASTING RESPONSIBILITIES: AT&T-13STATE
6.1 CLEC agrees to provide an initial forecast for all trunk groups described in this Appendix ITR. AT&T-
13STATE shall review this trunk forecast and provide any additional information that may impact the trunk
forecast information provided by CLEC. Subsequent trunk forecasts shall be provided on a semi-annual
basis, not later than January 1 and July 1 in order to be considered in the semi-annual publication of the
AT&T-13STATE General Trunk Forecast. Parties agree to the use of Common Language Location
Identification (CLLI) coding and Common Language Circuit Identification for Message Trunk coding (CLCI-
MSG) which is described in TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES documents BR795-100-100 and BR795-400-

Standards and document availability should be directed to TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-
2673.
6.2 The semi-annual forecasts shall include:
6.2.1 Yearly forecasted trunk quantities for all trunk groups required in this Appendix for a minimum of
three (current plus 2 future) years; and
6.2.2 A description of major network projects anticipated for the following six months. Major network
projects include trunking or network rearrangements, shifts in anticipated traffic patterns, orders
greater than four (4) DS1s, or other activities that are reflected by a significant increase or decrease
in trunking demand for the following forecasting period.
6.2.3 The Parties shall agree on these forecasts to ensure efficient trunk utilization. For forecast
quantities that are in dispute, the Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to develop a mutually
agreeable forecast.
6.2.4 Orders for trunks that exceed forecasted quantities for forecasted locations will be accommodated
as mutually agreed to by the Parties. Parties shall make all reasonable efforts and cooperate in
good faith to develop alternative solutions to accommodate these orders.
6.3 CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting two-way trunk groups. AT&T-13STATE shall be responsible for
forecasting the one-way trunk groups terminating to CLEC and CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting
the one-way trunk groups terminating to AT&T-13STATE, unless otherwise specified in this Appendix.
6.4 Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact for planning and forecasting purposes.
7. TRUNK DESIGN BLOCKING CRITERIA: AT&T-13STATE
7.1 Trunk requirements for forecasting and servicing shall be based on the blocking objectives shown in Table
1. Trunk requirements shall be based upon time consistent average busy season busy hour twenty (20)
day averaged loads applied to industry standard Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity algorithms (using
Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness factor until actual traffic data is available).
TABLE 1
Trunk Group Type Design Blocking Objective
Local Interconnection Trunk Group - Direct End Office (Primary High) ECCS*
Local Interconnection Trunk Group - Direct End Office (Final) 2%
IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 1%
Local Interconnection Trunk Group (Local Tandem) 1%
Meet Point (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 0.5%
E911 1%
Operator Services (DA/DACC) 1%
Operator Services (0+, 0-) 1%
Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt 1%
*During implementation the Parties will mutually agree on an Economic Centum Call Seconds (ECCS) or some
other means for the sizing of this trunk group.
8. TRUNK SERVICING: AT&T-13STATE
8.1 Orders between the Parties to establish, add, change or disconnect trunks shall be processed by using an
Access Service Request (ASR). CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on
two-way trunk groups. In AT&T CONNECTICUT where one-way trunks are provisioned, AT&T
CONNECTICUT will issue ASRs for trunk groups for traffic that originates from AT&T CONNECTICUT and
terminates to CLEC.

8.2 Both Parties will jointly manage the capacity of Local Only, Local Interconnection, and Meet Point Trunk
Groups. Both Parties may send a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to the other Party to trigger
changes to the Local Only, Local Interconnection, and Meet Point Trunk Groups based on capacity
assessment. The TGSR is a standard industry support interface developed by the Ordering and Billing
Forum of the Carrier liaison Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions (ATIS)
organization. TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Special Report STS000316 describes the format and use of
the TGSR. Contact TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-2673 regarding the documentation
availability and use of this form.
8.3 Utilization: Utilization shall be defined as Trunks Required as a percentage of Trunks In Service.
8.3.1 In A Blocking Situation (Over-utilization)
8.3.1.1 In a blocking situation, CLEC is responsible for issuing ASRs on all two-way Local Only,
Local Interconnection and Meet Point Trunk Groups and one-way CLEC originating Local
Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured blocking to design
objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an ASR is not issued,
AT&T-13STATE will issue a TSGR. CLEC will issue an ASR within three (3) business days
after receipt and review of the TGSR. CLEC will note "Service Affecting" on the ASR.
8.3.1.2 In a blocking situation, AT&T-13STATE is responsible for issuing ASRs on one-way AT&T
originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce measured
blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk group data. If an
ASR is not issued, CLEC will issue a TSGR. AT&T-13STATE will issue an ASR within three
(3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR.
8.3.1.3 If an alternate final Local Only Trunk Group or Local Interconnection Trunk Group is at
seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR is sent to CLEC for the final and all
subtending high usages that are contributing any amount of overflow to the alternate final
route.
8.3.1.4 If a direct final Meet Point Trunk Group is at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR
shall be sent to CLEC.
8.3.2 Underutilization
8.3.2.1 Underutilization of Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups and Meet
Point Trunk Groups exists when provisioned capacity is greater than the current need.
Those situations where more capacity exists than actual usage requires will be handled in
the following manner:
8.3.2.1.1 If a Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk Group or a Meet Point
Trunk Group is under seventy-five percent (75%) of CCS capacity on a monthly
average basis, for each month of any three (3) consecutive months period, either
Party may request the issuance of an order to resize the Local Only Trunk Group,
Local Interconnection Trunk Group or the Meet Point Trunk Group, which shall be
left with not less than twenty-five percent (25%) excess capacity. In all cases,
grade of service objectives shall be maintained.
8.3.2.1.2 Either party may send a TGSR to the other Party to trigger changes to the Local
Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups or Meet Point Trunk
Groups based on capacity assessment. Upon receipt of a TGSR, the receiving
Party will issue an ASR to the other Party within twenty (20) business days after
receipt of the TGSR.
8.3.2.1.3 Upon review of the TGSR, if a Party does not agree with the resizing, the Parties
will schedule a joint planning discussion within the twenty (20) business days. The
Parties will meet to resolve and mutually agree to the disposition of the TGSR.

062907
8.3.2.1.4 If AT&T-13STATE does not receive an ASR, or if CLEC does not respond to the
TGSR by scheduling a joint discussion within the twenty (20) business day period,
AT&T-13STATE will attempt to contact CLEC to schedule a joint planning
discussion. If CLEC will not agree to meet within an additional five (5) business
days and present adequate reason for keeping trunks operational, AT&T-
13STATE reserves the right to issue ASRs to resize the Local Only Trunk
Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, or Meet Point Trunk Groups.
8.3.3 Trunk Servicing – AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Exceptions
8.3.3.1 The Parties will process trunk service requests submitted via a properly completed ASR
within ten (10) business days of receipt of such ASR unless defined as a major project.
Incoming orders will be screened by AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE trunk
engineering personnel for reasonableness based upon current utilization and/or consistency
with forecasts. If the nature and necessity of an order requires determination, the ASR will
be placed in held status, and a Joint Planning discussion conducted. Parties agree to
expedite this discussion in order to minimize delay in order processing. Extension of this
review and discussion process beyond two days from ASR receipt will require the ordering
Party to Supplement the order with proportionally adjusted Customer Desired Due Dates.
Facilities must also be in place before trunk orders can be completed.
8.4 Projects require the coordination and execution of multiple orders or related activities between and among
AT&T-13STATE and CLEC work groups, including but not limited to the initial establishment of Local Only,
Local Interconnection or Meet Point Trunk Groups and service in an area, NXX code moves, re-homes,
facility grooming, or network rearrangements.
8.4.1 Orders that comprise a project, i.e. greater than four (4) DS1s, shall be submitted at the same time,
and their implementation shall be jointly planned and coordinated.
8.5 Projects-Tandem Rehomes/Switch Conversion/Major Network Projects
8.5.1 AT&T-13STATE will advise CLEC of all projects significantly affecting CLEC trunking. Such
Projects may include Tandem Rehomes, Switch Conversions and other major network changes. An
Accessible Letter with project details will be issued at least 6 months prior to the project due dates.
AT&T-13STATE will follow with a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) approximately 4 to 6
months before the due date of the project. A separate TGSR will be issued for each CLEC trunk
group and will specify the required CLEC ASR issue date. Failure to submit ASR(s) by the required
date may result in AT&T-13STATE ceasing to deliver traffic until the ASR(s) are received and
processed.
9. TRUNK DATA EXCHANGE: AT&T-13STATE
9.1 The Parties agree to exchange traffic data on two-way trunk groups and to implement such an exchange
within three (3) months of the date that two-way trunking is established and the trunk groups begin passing
live traffic, or another date is agreed to by the Parties.
9.2 Exchange of traffic data enables each Party to make accurate and independent assessments of trunk group
service levels and requirements. The Parties may agree to establish a timeline for implementing an
exchange of traffic data utilizing the DIXC process via a Network Data Mover (NDM) or FTP computer to
computer file transfer process. Implementation shall be within three (3) months of the date, or such date as
agreed upon, that the trunk groups begin passing live traffic. The traffic data to be exchanged will be the
Originating Attempt Peg Count, Usage (measured in Hundred Call Seconds), Overflow Peg Count, and
Maintenance Usage (measured in Hundred Call Seconds on a seven (7) day per week, twenty-four (24)
hour per day, fifty-two (52) weeks per year basis). The Parties agree that twenty (20) business days is the
study period duration objective. However, on occasion a study period may be less than twenty (20)
business days but at minimum must be at least three (3) business days to be utilized for engineering

10.1.1 Either Party may use protective network traffic management controls such as 7-digit and 10-digit
code gaps set at appropriate levels on traffic toward each other's network, when required, to protect
the public switched network from congestion due to facility failures, switch congestion, or failure or
focused overload. CLEC and AT&T-13STATE will immediately notify each other of any protective
control action planned or executed.
10.2 Expansive Controls
10.2.1 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be implemented by either
Party to temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling patterns.
Reroutes will not be used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Expansive controls will only be used
when mutually agreed to by the Parties.
10.3 Mass Calling
10.3.1 CLEC and AT&T-13STATE shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding
cross-network call-ins expected to generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes.
11. OUT OF EXCHANGE TRAFFIC
11.1 Interconnection services are available in accordance with section 251(a)(1) of the Act for the purposes of
exchanging traffic to/from a non-AT&T incumbent exchange and consistent with the Appendix Out of
Exchange Traffic.
12. SWITCHED ACCESS TRAFFIC
12.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates from an
end user physically located in one local exchange and delivered for termination to an end user physically
located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing a common mandatory local
calling area as defined in AT&T-13STATE’s local exchange tariffs on file with the applicable state
commission) including, without limitation, any traffic that (i) terminates over a Party’s circuit switch,
including traffic from a service that originates over a circuit switch and uses Internet Protocol (IP) transport
technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP transport or multiple providers are involved in
providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the end user’s premises in IP format and is transmitted to
the switch of a provider of voice communication applications or services when such switch utilizes IP
technology and terminates over a Party’s circuit switch. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group
access trunks per the terminating Party’s access tariff(s) and shall be subject to applicable intrastate and
interstate switched access charges; provided, however, the following categories of Switched Access Traffic
are not subject to the above stated requirement relating to routing over feature group access trunks:
(i) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC end user that obtains local dial tone from
CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the intraLATA toll provider,
(ii) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an AT&T end user that obtains local dial tone from
AT&T where AT&T is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the intraLATA toll provider;
(iii) Switched Access Traffic delivered to AT&T from an Interexchange Carrier (IXC) where the terminating
number is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the Local Number Portability (LNP)
query; and/or

(iv) Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a third party competitive local exchange carrier
over interconnection trunk groups carrying Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic (hereinafter
referred to as “Local Interconnection Trunk Groups”) destined to the other Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies, and
arguments relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the Parties
prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the Petition for
Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from Access Charges,
WC Docket No. 01-361(Released April 21, 2004).
12.2 In the limited circumstances in which a third party competitive local exchange carrier delivers Switched
Access Traffic as described in Section 12.1 (iv) above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups, such Party may deliver such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups. If it is determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups, the terminating Party may object to the delivery of such traffic by providing
written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions and request removal of such traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with
the goal of removing such traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has
not removed or is unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 12.1(iv) above
from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the other party,
the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the applicable Commission
to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such interconnection trunks up to and including
the right to block such traffic and to obtain compensation, if appropriate, from the third party competitive
local exchange carrier delivering such traffic to the extent it is not blocked.

area/LATA. Using one or more of the NIMs herein, the Parties will agree to a physical architecture plan for
a specific Interconnection area. A physical architecture plan will, at a minimum, include the location of
CLEC’s switch(es) and AT&T-13STATE’s End Office switch(es) and/or Tandem switch(es) to be

interconnected, the facilities that will connect the two networks and which Party will provide (be financially
responsible for) the interconnection facilities. At the time of implementation in a given local exchange area
or LATA the plan will be documented and signed by appropriate representatives of the Parties, indicating
their mutual agreement to the physical architecture plan.
2.2 Points of Interconnection (POIs): A Point of Interconnection (POI) is a point on the AT&T-13STATE
network (End Office or Tandem building) where the Parties deliver Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic
to each other, and also serves as a demarcation point between the facilities that each Party is responsible
to provide.
2.3 Each Party is responsible for the facilities to its side of the negotiated POI(s) and may utilize any method of
Interconnection described in this Appendix. Each Party is responsible for the appropriate sizing, operation,
and maintenance of the transport facility to the POI(s). The parties agree to provide sufficient facilities for
the trunk groups required in Appendix ITR for the exchange of traffic between CLEC and AT&T-13STATE.
2.4 Types of Points of Interconnection
2.4.1 A “Tandem Serving Area” or “TSA” is an AT&T-13STATE area defined by the sum of all local calling
areas served by AT&T-13STATE End Offices that subtend an AT&T-13STATE tandem for Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic as defined in the LERG.
2.4.2 The Parties will interconnect their network facilities at a minimum of one CLEC designated Point of
Interconnection (POI) within AT&T-13STATE’s network in the LATA where CLEC Offers Service.
2.4.3 A “Single POI” is a single point of interconnection within a LATA on AT&T-13STATE’s network that
is established to interconnect AT&T-13STATE’s network and CLEC’s network for the exchange of
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
2.4.4 The Parties agree that CLEC has the right to choose a Single POI or multiple POIs.
2.4.5 When CLEC has established a Single POI (or multiple POIs) in a LATA, CLEC agrees to establish
an additional POI:
(i) at an AT&T-13STATE TSA separate from the existing POI arrangement when traffic through the
existing POI arrangement to that AT&T-13STATE TSA exceeds twenty-four (24) DS1s at peak over
three (3) consecutive months, or
(ii) at an AT&T-13STATE End Office in a local calling area not served by an AT&T-13STATE
tandem for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic when traffic through the existing POI
arrangement to that local calling area exceeds twenty-four (24) DS1s at peak over three (3)
consecutive months.
2.4.6 The additional POI(s) will be established within 90 days of notification that the threshold has been
met.
2.5 Either Party must provide thirty (30) days written notice of any intent to change to the physical architecture
plan.
2.6 CLEC is solely responsible for the facilities that carry OS/DA, E911, Mass Calling and Meet Point Trunk
Groups as specified in Appendix ITR.
2.7 Technical Interfaces
2.7.1 The Interconnection facilities provided by each Party shall be formatted using either Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI) line code with Superframe format framing or Bipolar 8 Zero Signaling (B8ZS) with
Extended Superframe format framing or any mutually agreeable line coding and framing.
2.7.2 Electrical handoffs at the POI(s) will be at the DS1 or DS3 level. When a DS3 handoff is agreed to
by the Parties, AT&T-13STATE will provide any multiplexing required for DS1 facilities or trunking at
their end and CLEC will provide any DS1 multiplexing required for facilities or trunking at their end.

2.7.3 When the Parties demonstrate the need for Optical handoffs at the OC-n level, the parties will meet
to negotiate specific Optical handoff needs.
3. METHODS OF INTERCONNECTION
3.1 Physical Collocation
3.1.1 When CLEC provides its own facilities or uses the facilities of a third party to a AT&T-13STATE
Tandem or End Office building and wishes to place its own transport terminating equipment at that
location, CLEC may Interconnect using the provisions of Physical Collocation as set forth in
Appendix Collocation.
3.2 Virtual Collocation
3.2.1 When CLEC provides its own facilities or uses the facilities of a third party to a AT&T-13STATE
Tandem or End Office building and wishes for AT&T-13STATE to place transport terminating
equipment at that location on CLEC’s behalf, CLEC may Interconnect using the provisions of Virtual
Collocation as set forth in Appendix Collocation. Virtual Collocation allows CLEC to choose the
equipment vendor and does not require that CLEC be Physically Collocated.
3.3 Fiber Meet Point
3.3.1 Fiber Meet Point between AT&T-13STATE and CLEC can occur at any mutually agreeable and
technically feasible point at an AT&T-13STATE Tandem or End Office building within each local
exchange area (AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE) or LATA (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE, AT&T CONNECTICUT, and AT&T-2STATE).
3.3.2 When the Parties agree to interconnect their networks pursuant to the Fiber Meet Point, a single
point-to-point linear chain SONET system must be utilized. Only Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups shall be provisioned over this jointly provided facility.
3.3.3 Neither Party will be allowed to access the Data Communications Channel (“DCC”) of the other
Party’s Fiber Optic Terminal (FOT). The Fiber Meet Point will be designed so that each Party may,
as far as is technically feasible, independently select the transmission, multiplexing, and fiber
terminating equipment to be used on its side of the POI(s). The Parties will work cooperatively to
achieve equipment and vendor compatibility of the FOT equipment.
3.3.4 Requirements for such Interconnection specifications will be defined in joint engineering planning
sessions between the Parties.
3.3.5 In addition to the semi-annual trunk forecast process, discussed in Appendix ITR, discussions to
provide relief to existing facilities can be initiated by either party. Actual system augmentations will
be initiated only upon mutual agreement. Facilities will be planned for to accommodate the verified
and mutually agreed upon trunk forecast for the Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s).
3.3.6 Both Parties will negotiate a project service date and corresponding work schedule to construct relief
facilities prior to facilities exhaust.
3.3.7 CLEC will provide fiber cable to the last entrance (or AT&T-13STATE designated) manhole at the
AT&T-13STATE Tandem or End Office building. AT&T-13STATE shall make all necessary
preparations to receive and to allow and enable CLEC to deliver fiber optic facilities into that
manhole. CLEC will provide a sufficient length of Fiber cable for AT&T-13STATE to pull through to
the AT&T-13STATE cable vault. CLEC shall deliver and maintain such strands wholly at its own
expense up to the POI. AT&T-13STATE shall take the fiber from the manhole and terminate it
inside AT&T-13STATE’s office at the cable vault at AT&T-13STATE’s expense. In this case the
POI shall be at the AT&T-13STATE designated manhole location.
3.3.8 Each Party shall provide its own source for the synchronized timing of its FOT equipment.
3.3.9 CLEC and AT&T-13STATE will mutually agree on the capacity of the FOT(s) to be utilized based on
equivalent DS1s or DS3s. Each Party will also agree upon the optical frequency and wavelength
Page 200 of 551

necessary to implement the Interconnection. The Parties will develop and agree upon methods for
the capacity planning and management for these facilities, terms and conditions for over provisioning
facilities, and the necessary processes to implement facilities as indicated in section 4 of this
document.
3.4 Other Interconnection Methods
3.4.1 The Parties may mutually agree to other methods of obtaining interconnection that are technically
feasible which are incorporated into the Interconnection Agreement by amendment.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES
4.1 For each local Interconnection within an AT&T-13STATE area, CLEC shall provide written notice to AT&T-
13STATE of the need to establish Interconnection in each local exchange area (AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE) or LATA (AT&T-2STATE, AT&T CONNECTICUT and AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE).CLEC shall provide all applicable network information on forms acceptable to AT&T-13STATE (as
set forth in AT&T’s CLEC Handbook, published on the CLEC website).
4.2 Upon receipt of CLEC’s notice to interconnect, the Parties shall schedule a meeting to document the
network architecture (including trunking) as discussed in Section 2.1. The Interconnection activation date
for an Interconnection shall be established based on then-existing force and load, the scope and complexity
of the requested Interconnection and other relevant factors.
4.3 Either party may add or remove additional switches. The parties shall provide 120 days written notice to
establish such Interconnection; and the terms and conditions of this agreement will apply to such
Interconnection.
4.4 The Parties recognize that a facility handoff point must be agreed to that establishes the demarcation for
maintenance and provisioning responsibilities for each party on their side of the POI.

2. LOCAL NUMBER PORTABILITY (LNP)
2.1 General Terms and Conditions
2.1.1 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall provide Local Number Portability (LNP) in accordance with
requirements of the Act, the rules and orders of the FCC, and the guidelines of the North American
Numbering Council (NANC).
2.2 Requirements for LNP
2.2.1 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall follow industry guidelines, including but not limited to North
American Numbering Council (NANC) Inter Service Provider Operations Flows, regarding LNP.
Page 204 of 551

APPENDIX LNP/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 4 OF 6
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
2.2.2 Either party shall be permitted to block default -routed calls to protect the public switched telephone
network from overload, congestion, or failure propagation.
2.2.3 When a ported telephone number becomes vacant, e.g., the telephone number is no longer in
service with the original End User, the ported telephone number will be released back to the carrier
owning the switch in which the telephone number’s NXX is native.
2.2.4 Each Party shall become responsible for the End User’s other telecommunications related services
and features, e.g. E911, Directory Listings, Operator Services, Line Information Database (LIDB),
once that Party has ported the End User’s telephone number to the Party’s switch.
2.3 Limitations of Service
2.3.1 Telephone numbers can be ported as a basic network offering only within AT&T-13STATE rate
centers as approved by State Commissions. “Porting within rate centers” refers to the physical
location of the End User. If the End User changes his, her or its physical location from one rate
center to another, the End User may not retain his, her or its telephone number (which is associated
with the End User’s previous rate center) as a basic network (non-FX) offering. An End User may
retain his, her or its telephone number when moving from one rate center to another by the use of a
tariff FX or Remote Call Forwarding offering from the new service provider. The term “FX,” as used
in this appendix, refers to number assignments and moves outside the rate centers with which a
telephone number is ordinarily associated, and is different from the term “FX” in the Compensation
attachment, which refers number assignment and moves outside of a mandatory local calling area.
2.3.2 Telephone numbers of the following types shall not be ported: (i) AT&T-13STATE Official
Communications Services (OCS) NXXs; and (ii) 555, 976, 950, 956, 976 and 900 numbers (iii) N11
numbers (e.g., 411 and 911); (iv) 800, 888, 877 and 866 numbers; and (v) disconnected or
unassigned numbers.
2.3.3 Telephone numbers with NXXs dedicated to choke/High Volume Call-In (HVCI) networks are not
portable via LRN. Choke numbers will be ported as described in Section 5.5 of this Appendix.
2.4 Service Description
2.4.1 The LRN software of the switch in which an NXX is native determines if the called party is in a
portable NXX. When a calling party places a telephone call, if the called party is in a portable NXX,
a query will be launched to the LNP database to determine whether or not the called number has
been ported.
2.4.2 When the called number has been ported, an LRN will be returned to the switch that launched the
query. Following the query, the LRN of the called number will appear in the Called Party Number
(CdPN) field of the SS7 message and the called number will appear in the Generic Address
Parameter (GAP) field.
2.4.3 When the query does not return an LRN, the call will be completed based upon the dialed digits.
2.4.4 When the LNP database is queried, the Forward Call Identifier (FCI) field’s entry will be changed
from 0 to 1 by the switch triggering the query, regardless of whether the called number has been
ported or not.
2.4.5 Where technically feasible, the Parties shall populate the Jurisdictional Identification Parameter (JIP)
field with the first six (6) digits (NPA NXX format) of the appropriate LRN of the originating switch.
2.5 Pricing
2.5.1 With the exception of lawful query charges, the parties shall not charge each other for ordering,
provisioning, or conversion of ported telephone numbers as a means for the other to recover the
costs associated with LNP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-13STATE may charge CLEC LNP
end user surcharges, provided that the conditions set forth in 47 CFR § 52.33 are met.

062907
3. “N-1” QUERY METHODOLOGY
3.1 The parties shall follow the “N-1” query methodology in performing queries of the LNP database, as
provided below. As provided by Industry standards, the N-1” carrier is the carrier in the call routing
sequence immediately prior to the terminating carrier’s end office, or the terminating carrier’s end office
tandem. The “N-1” carrier shall perform the LNP database query. If the “N-1” carrier fails to perform the
LNP database query, the terminating carrier shall perform a query of the LNP database, and shall be
permitted to change the N-1 carrier for the query.
3.1.1 For interLATA or intraLATA toll calls, the originating carrier will pass the call to the appropriate toll
carrier, which will perform a query of the LNP database and efficiently route the call to the
appropriate terminating local carrier, either directly or through an access tandem office. Where one
carrier is the originating local service provider (LSP) and the other carrier is the designated toll
carrier, the designated toll carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating LSP will not query toll calls
delivered to the toll carrier or charge the toll carrier for such queries.
3.1.2 For local calls to ported numbers, the originating carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating carrier
will query the LNP database and route the call to the appropriate terminating carrier.
3.1.3 For local calls to any NXX from which at least one number has been ported, the Party that owns the
originating switch shall query an LNP database as soon as the call reaches the first LNP-capable
switch in the call path. The Party that owns the originating switch shall query on a local call to an
NXX in which at least one number has been ported via LNP prior to any attempts to route the call to
any other switch. Prior to the first number in an NXX being ported via LNP at the request of a CLEC,
AT&T-13STATE may query all calls directed to that NXX, provided that AT&T-13STATE’s queries
shall not adversely affect the quality of service to CLEC’s customers or end-users as compared to
the service AT&T-13STATE provides its own customers.
3.1.4 A Party shall be charged for an LNP query by the other Party only if the Party to be charged is the N-
1 carrier and was obligated to perform the LRN-PNP query but failed to do so, pursuant to conditions
set forth in CFR 47, Section 52.33. The only exception will be if the FCC rules (Docket No. 95-116)
that the terminating carrier may charge the N-1 carrier for queries initiated before the first number is
ported in an NXX.
3.1.5 Rates, terms and conditions for LNP queries performed by AT&T-13STATE will be governed by
FCC No. 73 Access Services Tariff, Section 34, or a successor tariff.
4. ORDERING
4.1 Porting of numbers marked as portable in the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) will be initiated via
Local Service Requests (LSR) based on Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF) recommendations.
4.1.1 When an LSR is sent to one Party by the other Party to initiate porting via LNP, the receiving Party
shall return, at the appropriate time, a Firm Order Confirmation (FOC).
4.1.2 For the purposes of this Attachment, the Parties may use a project management approach for the
implementation of LSRs for large quantities of ported numbers or for complex porting processes.
With regard to such managed projects (“projects”), the parties may negotiate implementation details
such as, but not limited to: Due Date, Cutover Intervals and Times, Coordination of Technical
Resources, and Completion Notice.
5. PROVISIONING
5.1 The Parties will remove a ported number from the end office from which the number is being ported as
close to the requested time as reasonably practicable, not to exceed 59 minutes, except under the
conditions listed below in 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3. The 59-minute period shall commence upon the Frame
Due Time (FDT) shown on the receiving party’s LSR, or as otherwise negotiated by the parties on a project
basis. The parties recognize that it is in the best interest of the consumer for this removal to be completed
in the most expedient manner possible. Therefore, AT&T-13STATE and CLEC agree that a 30-minute
Page 206 of 551

APPENDIX LNP/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 6 OF 6
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
interval is a goal toward which both companies will work; however, both CLEC and AT&T-13STATE
recognize that there will be instances where the interval may be up to 59 minutes.
5.1.1 Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger. If the Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger is set, calls originating from
the old switch will query the database and route to the new switch without the number being
disconnected. The ported number must be removed at the same time that the unconditional LNP
trigger is removed.
5.1.2 Project Orders. For project requests, the Parties will negotiate time frames for the disconnection of
the numbers in the old switch.
5.1.3 Coordinated Orders. Orders worked on a coordinated basis will be coordinated until the numbers
are disconnected in the old switch.
5.2 The Parties agree to provide Unconditional Ten Digit Trigger wherever technically feasible.
5.3 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall cooperate in the process of porting numbers from one carrier to another
so as to limit service outage for the ported subscriber. AT&T-13STATE and CLEC will use their best efforts
to update their respective Local Service Management Systems (LSMS) from the NPAC SMS data within 15
minutes after receipt of a download from the NPAC SMS (the current North American Numbering Council
goal for such updating).
5.4 At the time a telephone number is ported via LNP, the Party from which the number is being ported shall
insure that the LIDB entry for that number is deprovisioned.
5.5 Mass Calling
5.5.1 Both AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall to offer Local Number Portability for telephone numbers with
“choke” (i.e., mass calling) NXXs in a manner that complies with the FCC's criteria.
5.6 Operator Services, LIDB/LVAS and Directory Assistance
5.6.1 The Provisions of this Agreement pertaining to Operator Services, LIDB/LVAS and Directory
Assistance shall also apply when LNP is in place.
5.7 Porting of DID Block Numbers
5.7.1 DID block numbers shall be portable in the same manner as other local telephone numbers, subject
to the modifications and/or limitations provided herein.
5.7.2 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall offer Local Number Portability to customers for any portion of an
existing DID block without being required to port the entire block of DID number.
5.7.3 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC shall permit customers which port a portion of DID numbers to retain
DID service on the remaining portion of the DID numbers, provided such is consistent with
applicable tariffs.

d/b/a AT&T Arkansas, AT&T Kansas, AT&T Missouri, AT&T Oklahoma and/or AT&T Texas and/or
Wisconsin Bell, Inc. d/b/a AT&T Wisconsin will coordinate with respect to NXX assignments.
1.2 As used herein, AT&T-13STATE means the above listed ILECs doing business in Arkansas, California,
Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin.
2. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
2.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely impact in any manner either
Party's right to employ or to request and be assigned any North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number
resources from the numbering administrator including, but not limited to, central office (NXX) codes
pursuant to the Central Office Code Assignment Guidelines, or to establish, by tariff or otherwise,
Exchanges and Rating Points corresponding to such NXX codes. Each Party is responsible for
administering the NXX codes it is assigned.
2.2 At a minimum, in those Metropolitan Exchange Areas where the CLEC is properly certified by the
appropriate regulatory body and intends to provide local exchange service, the CLEC shall obtain a
separate NXX code for each AT&T-13STATE rate center which is required to ensure compliance with the
industry-approved Central Office Code (NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version) or other
industry approved numbering guidelines and the FCC’s Second Report & Order in CC Docket 95-116,
released August 18, 1997 (Local Number Portability). This will enable CLEC and AT&T-13STATE to
identify the jurisdictional nature of traffic for intercompany compensation until such time as both Parties
have implemented billing and routing capabilities to determine traffic jurisdiction on a basis other than NXX
codes.
2.3 Pursuant to Section 7.3 of the North American Numbering Council Local Number Portability Architecture
and Administrative Plan report, which was adopted by the FCC, Second Report and Order, CC Docket 95-
116, released August 18, 1997, portability is technically limited to rate center/rate district boundaries of the
incumbent LEC due to rating and routing concerns. Therefore, Parties shall assign telephone numbers
from its NXX’s only to those customers that are physically in the rate center to which the NXX is assigned.
2.4 Each Party is responsible to program and update its own switches and network systems to recognize and
route traffic to the other Party's assigned NXX codes at all times. Neither Party shall impose fees or charges
on the other Party for such required programming and updating activities.
2.5 Each Party is responsible to input required data into the Routing Data Base Systems (RDBS) and into the
Telcordia Rating Administrative Data Systems (BRADS) or other appropriate system(s) necessary to
update the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), unless negotiated otherwise.

2. LAWFUL UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS
2.1 This Appendix is for OSS transactions related to UNEs (as provided in Appendix Lawful UNE), and Resold
service which AT&T-13STATE provides under this Interconnection Agreement (ICA service(s)). Should
AT&T-13STATE no longer be obligated to provide a UNE under the terms of this Agreement, AT&T-
13STATE shall no longer be obligated to offer access and use of OSS for that ICA service.
3. GENERAL CONDITIONS
3.1 Resale and Unbundled Network Elements (UNE) functions will be accessible via electronic interface(s), as
described herein, where such functions are available. The Parties agree that electronic order processing is
more efficient than manual order processing. During implementation the Parties will negotiate a threshold
volume of orders after which electronic ordering is required. Once CLEC is submitting more than the
agreed to threshold amount, but not later than twelve (12) months from the Effective Date of this
Agreement, CLEC will no longer submit orders manually (and AT&T-13STATE shall not be required to
accept and process manual orders) except when the electronic order processing is unavailable for a
substantial period of time, or where a given order cannot be processed electronically.
3.2 Proper Use of OSS Interfaces
3.2.1 For AT&T-13STATE, CLEC agrees to utilize AT&T-13STATE electronic interfaces, as described
herein, only for the purposes specifically provided herein. In addition, CLEC agrees that such use
will comply with AT&T-13STATE's Data Connection Security Requirements as identified in Section 9
of this Appendix. Failure to comply with such security guidelines may result in forfeiture of electronic
access to OSS functionality. In addition, CLEC shall be responsible for and indemnifies AT&T-
13STATE against any cost, expense or liability relating to any unauthorized entry or access into, or
use or manipulation of AT&T-13STATE’s OSS from CLEC systems, workstations or terminals or by
CLEC employees, agents, or any third party gaining access through information and/or facilities
obtained from or utilized by CLEC and shall pay AT&T-13STATE for any and all damages caused
by such unauthorized entry.
3.3 Within AT&T-13STATE regions, CLEC’s access to pre-order functions described in 4.2.2 will only be
utilized to view Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) of another carrier’s End User where
CLEC has obtained an authorization from the End User for release of CPNI.
3.3.1 In AT&T-13STATE regions, CLEC must maintain records of individual customers' authorizations for
change in local exchange service and release of CPNI which adhere to all requirements of state and
federal law, as applicable.
3.3.2 This section applies to AT&T CALIFORNIA ONLY. For consumer End Users, prior to accessing
such information, CLEC shall, on its own behalf and on behalf of AT&T CALIFORNIA, comply with
all applicable requirements of Section 2891 of the California Public Utilities Code and 47 USC 222
(and implementing FCC decisions thereunder), and, where accessing such information via an
electronic interface, CLEC shall have obtained an authorization to become the End User’s local
service provider. Accessing such information by CLEC shall constitute certification that CLEC is in
compliance with applicable requirements of Section 2891 and Section 222 (and implementing FCC
decisions thereunder) and has complied with the prior sentence. CLEC shall receive and retain such
information in conformance with the requirements of 47 USC 222 (and implementing FCC decisions
thereunder). CLEC agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T CALIFORNIA against any
claim made by a consumer End User or governmental entity against AT&T CALIFORNIA or CLEC
under Section 2891 or Section 222 (and implementing FCC decisions thereunder) or for any breach
by CLEC of this section.
3.3.3 Throughout AT&T-13STATE region, CLEC is solely responsible for determining whether proper
authorization has been obtained and holds AT&T-13STATE harmless from any loss on account of
CLEC’s failure to obtain proper CPNI consent from an End User.

3.4 By utilizing electronic interfaces to access OSS functions, CLEC agrees to perform accurate and correct
ordering including Resale services and UNEs. Rates and charges are subject to the terms of this
Agreement and applicable tariffs are dependent on region of operation. CLEC is also responsible for all
actions of its employees using any of AT&T-13STATE’s OSS systems. As such, CLEC agrees to accept
and pay all reasonable costs or expenses, including labor costs, incurred by AT&T-13STATE caused by
any and all inaccurate ordering or usage of the OSS, if such costs are not already recovered through other
charges assessed by AT&T-13STATE to CLEC. In addition, CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T-
13STATE harmless against any claim made by an End User of CLEC or other third parties against AT&T-
13STATE caused by or related to CLEC’s use of any AT&T-13STATE OSS.
3.5 In the event AT&T-13STATE has good cause to believe that CLEC has used AT&T-13STATE OSS in a
way that conflicts with this Agreement or Applicable Law, AT&T-owned ILEC in whose territory CLEC is
doing business shall give CLEC written notice describing the alleged misuse (“Notice of Misuse”). CLEC
shall immediately refrain from the alleged misuse until such time that CLEC responds in writing to the
Notice of Misuse, which shall be provided to AT&T-13STATE within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt
of the Notice of Misuse. In the event CLEC agrees with the allegation of misuse, CLEC shall refrain from
the alleged misuse during the term of this Agreement.
3.6 In the event CLEC does not agree that the CLEC’s use of AT&T-13STATE OSS is inconsistent with this
Agreement or Applicable Law, then the parties agree to the following steps:
3.6.1 If such misuse involves improper access of pre-order applications or involves a violation of the
security guidelines contained herein, or negatively affects another OSS user's ability to use OSS,
CLEC shall continue to refrain from using the particular OSS functionality in the manner alleged by
AT&T-13STATE to be improper, until CLEC has implemented a mutually agreeable remedy to the
alleged misuse.
3.6.2 To remedy the misuse for the balance of the agreement, the Parties will work together as necessary
to mutually determine a permanent resolution for the balance of the term of the agreement.
3.7 In order to determine whether CLEC has engaged in the alleged misuse described in the Notice of Misuse,
and for good cause shown, AT&T-13STATE shall have the right to conduct an audit of CLEC’s use of the
AT&T-13STATE OSS. Such audit shall be limited to auditing those aspects of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-
13STATE OSS that relate to the allegation of misuse as set forth in the Notice of Misuse. AT&T-13STATE
shall give ten (10) calendar days advance written notice of its intent to audit CLEC (“Audit Notice”) under
this Section 3.7, and shall identify the type of information needed for the audit. Such Audit Notice may not
precede the Notice of Misuse. Within a reasonable time following the Audit Notice, but no less than fourteen
(14) calendar days after the date of the notice (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties), CLEC shall provide
AT&T-13STATE with access to the requested information in any reasonably requested format, at an
appropriate CLEC location, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. The audit shall be at AT&T-
13STATE's expense. All information obtained through such an audit shall be deemed proprietary and/or
confidential and subject to confidential treatment without necessity for marking such information
confidential. AT&T-13STATE agrees that it shall only use employees or outside parties to conduct the
audit who do not have marketing, strategic analysis, competitive assessment or similar responsibilities
within AT&T-13STATE.
3.8 When Resale service and UNE order functions are not available via an electronic interface for the pre-
order, ordering and provisioning processes, AT&T-13STATE and CLEC will use manual processes.
Should AT&T-13STATE develop electronic interfaces for these functions for itself, AT&T-13STATE will
make electronic access available to CLEC within the specific operating region.
3.9 The Information Services (I.S.) Call Center for the AT&T-13STATE region provides for technical support
function of electronic OSS interfaces. CLEC will also provide a single point of contact for technical issues
related to the CLEC’s electronic interfaces.

3.10 The Parties will follow the final adopted guidelines of “AT&T 13-State Competitive Local Exchange Carrier
(CLEC) OSS Interface Change Management Process”, developed in collaboration with CLECs. This plan
may be modified from time to time in accordance with the Change Management principles.
3.11 AT&T-13STATE will and CLEC may participate in the Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF) to establish and
conform to uniform industry guidelines for electronic interfaces for pre-order, ordering, and provisioning.
Neither Party waives its rights as participants in such forums or in the implementation of the guidelines. To
achieve system functionality as quickly as possible, the Parties acknowledge that AT&T-13STATE may
deploy interfaces with requirements developed in advance of industry guidelines. Thus, subsequent
modifications may be necessary to comply with emerging guidelines. CLEC and AT&T-13STATE are
individually responsible for evaluating the risk of developing their respective systems in advance of
guidelines and agree to support their own system modifications to comply with new requirements. In
addition, AT&T-13STATE has the right to define Local Service Request (LSR) Usage requirements
according to the General Section 1.0, paragraph 1.4 of the practices in the OBF Local Service Ordering
Guidelines (LSOG), which states: “Options described in this practice may not be applicable to individual
providers tariffs; therefore, use of either the field or valid entries within the field is based on the providers
tariffs/practices.”
3.12 Due to enhancements and on-going development of access to AT&T-13STATE OSS functions, certain
interfaces described in this Appendix may be modified, temporarily unavailable or may be phased out after
execution of this Appendix. AT&T-13STATE shall provide proper notice of interface phase-out as required
by the Change Management Process.
3.13 CLEC is responsible for obtaining operating system software and hardware to access AT&T-13STATE
OSS functions. All hardware and software requirements are specified in: “Competitive Local Exchange

up or direct connection as described in Section 8.2. CLEC may utilize a port to access AT&T-13STATE
OSS interfaces to perform the supported functions in any AT&T-13STATE where CLEC has executed an
Appendix OSS. OSS applications that are accessible through the Internet will also go through a secured
Remote Access Facility.
8.2 For AT&T-13STATE, CLEC may use three types of access: Switched, Private Line, and Frame Relay. For
Private Line and Frame Relay “Direct Connections,” the connecting CLEC is responsible for providing
CLEC router, and all network equipment (including Channel Service Units/Data Service Units(CSU/DSU))

and circuit connection(s) up to the AT&T ILEC company point of demarcation. The demarcation point shall
be the interface at the LRAF, PRAF, ARAF, or SRAF according to AT&T-13STATE “Competitive Local
Exchange Carrier (CLEC) Operations Support System Interconnection Procedures”. Switched Access
“Dial-up Connections” require CLEC to provide its own modems and connection to the AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE LRAF, AT&T-2STATE PRAF, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE ARAF, and AT&T
CONNECTICUT SRAF. CLEC shall pay the cost of the call if Switched Access is used. Connections via
the Public Internet require CLEC to connect to an ISP of their choice and use one of the HTTPS URLs
associated with access to AT&T-13STATE OSS via the public internet.
8.3 For AT&T-13STATE, CLEC shall use TCP/IP to access AT&T-13STATE OSS via the LRAF, ARAF, SRAF,
and the PRAF. In addition, each CLEC shall have one valid Internet Protocol (IP) network address per
region. CLEC shall maintain a user ID / password unique to each individual for accessing an AT&T-
13STATE OSS on CLEC’s behalf. CLEC shall provide estimates regarding its volume of transactions,
number of concurrent users, desired number of private line or dial-up (switched) connections, and length of
a typical session.
8.4 For AT&T-13STATE, CLEC shall attend and participate in implementation meetings to discuss CLEC
LRAF/PRAF/ARAF/SRAF access plans in detail and schedule testing of such connections.
9. DATA CONNECTION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
9.1 CLEC agrees that interconnection of CLEC data facilities with AT&T-13STATE data facilities for access to
OSS will be in compliance with AT&T-13STATE’s “Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) Operations
Support System Interconnection Procedures” document current at the time of initial connection to a RAF.
The following additional terms in this Section 9 govern direct and dial up connections between CLEC and
the PRAF, LRAF, ARAF and SRAF for access to OSS interfaces.
9.2 Joint Security Requirements
9.2.1 Both Parties will maintain accurate and auditable records that monitor user authentication and
machine integrity and confidentiality (e.g., password assignment and aging, chronological logs
configured, system accounting data, etc.).
9.2.2 Both Parties shall maintain accurate and complete records detailing the individual data connections
and systems to which they have granted the other Party access or interface privileges. These
records will include, but are not limited to, user ID assignment, user request records, system
configuration, time limits of user access or system interfaces. These records should be kept until the
termination of this Agreement or the termination of the requested access by the identified individual.
Either Party may initiate a compliance review of the connection records to verify that only the agreed
to connections are in place and that the connection records are accurate.
9.2.3 CLEC shall immediately notify the ISCC when a employee user ID is no longer valid (e.g. employee
termination or movement to another department).
9.2.4 Both Parties shall use an industry standard virus detection software program at all times. The
Parties shall immediately advise each other by telephone upon actual knowledge that a virus or
other malicious code has been transmitted to the other Party.
9.2.5 All physical access to equipment and services required to transmit data will be in secured locations.
Verification of authorization will be required for access to all such secured locations. A secured
location is where walls and doors are constructed and arranged to serve as barriers and to provide
uniform protection for all equipment used in the data connections which are made as a result of the
user’s access to either the CLEC or AT&T-13STATE network. At a minimum, this shall include:
access doors equipped with card reader control or an equivalent authentication procedure and/or
device, and egress doors which generate a real-time alarm when opened and which are equipped
with tamper resistant and panic hardware as required to meet building and safety standards.
9.2.6 Both Parties shall maintain accurate and complete records on the card access system or lock and
key administration to the rooms housing the equipment utilized to make the connection(s) to the

other Party’s network. These records will include management of card or key issue, activation or
distribution and deactivation.
9.3 Additional Responsibilities of Both Parties
9.3.1 Modem/DSU Maintenance And Use Policy: To the extent the access provided hereunder involves
the support and maintenance of CLEC equipment on AT&T-13STATE’s premises, such
maintenance will be provided under the terms of the “Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC)
Operations Support System Interconnection Procedures” document cited above.
9.3.2 Monitoring: Each Party will monitor its own network relating to any user's access to the Party’s
networks, processing systems, and applications. This information may be collected, retained, and
analyzed to identify potential security risks without notice. This information may include, but is not
limited to, trace files, statistics, network addresses, and the actual data or screens accessed or
transferred.
9.3.3 Each Party shall notify the other Party’s security organization immediately upon initial discovery of
actual or suspected unauthorized access to, misuse of, or other “at risk” conditions regarding the
identified data facilities or information. Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact. If either
Party suspects unauthorized or inappropriate access, the Parties shall work together to isolate and
resolve the problem.
9.3.4 In the event that one Party identifies inconsistencies or lapses in the other Party’s adherence to the
security provisions described herein, or a discrepancy is found, documented, and delivered to the
non-complying Party, a corrective action plan to address the identified vulnerabilities must be
provided by the non-complying Party within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the identified
inconsistency. The corrective action plan must identify what will be done, the Party
accountable/responsible, and the proposed compliance date. The non-complying Party must
provide periodic status reports (minimally monthly) to the other Party's security organization on the
implementation of the corrective action plan in order to track the work to completion.
9.3.5 In the event there are technological constraints or situations where either Party’s corporate security
requirements cannot be met, the Parties will institute mutually agreed upon alternative security
controls and safeguards to mitigate risks.
9.3.6 All network-related problems will be managed to resolution by the respective organizations, CLEC or
AT&T-13STATE, as appropriate to the ownership of a failed component. As necessary, CLEC and
AT&T-13STATE will work together to resolve problems where the responsibility of either Party is not
easily identified.
9.4 Information Security Policies And Guidelines For Access To Computers, Networks and Information
By Non-Employee Personnel
9.4.1 Information security policies and guidelines are designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and
availability of computer, networks and information resources. Section 9.5 - 9.11 summarizes the
general policies and principles for individuals who are not employees of the Party that provides the
computer, network or information, but have authorized access to that Party’s systems, networks or
information. Questions should be referred to CLEC or AT&T-13STATE, respectively, as the
providers of the computer, network or information in question.
9.4.2 It is each Party’s responsibility to notify its employees, contractors and vendors who will have access
to the other Party’s network, on the proper security responsibilities identified within this Attachment.
Adherence to these policies is a requirement for continued access to the other Party’s systems,
networks or information. Exceptions to the policies must be requested in writing and approved by
the other Party’s information security organization.
9.5 General Policies
9.5.1 Each Party’s resources are for approved business purposes only.

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
9.5.2 Each Party may exercise at any time its right to inspect, record, and/or remove all information
contained in its systems, and take appropriate action should unauthorized or improper usage be
discovered.
9.5.3 Individuals will only be given access to resources that they are authorized to receive and which they
need to perform their job duties. Users must not attempt to access resources for which they are not
authorized.
9.5.4 Authorized users must not develop, copy or use any program or code which circumvents or
bypasses system security or privilege mechanism or distorts accountability or audit mechanisms.
9.5.5 Actual or suspected unauthorized access events must be reported immediately to each Party’s
security organization or to an alternate contact identified by that Party. Each Party shall provide its
respective security contact information to the other.
9.6 User Identification
9.6.1 Access to each Party’s corporate resources will be based on identifying and authenticating individual
users in order to maintain clear and personal accountability for each user’s actions.
9.6.2 User identification shall be accomplished by the assignment of a unique, permanent user ID, and
each user ID shall have an associated identification number for security purposes.
9.6.3 User IDs will be revalidated on a monthly basis.
9.7 User Authentication
9.7.1 Users will usually be authenticated by use of a password. Strong authentication methods (e.g. one-
time passwords, digital signatures, etc.) may be required in the future.
9.7.2 Passwords must not be stored in script files.
9.7.3 Passwords must be entered by the user.
9.7.4 Passwords must be at least 6-8 characters in length, not blank or a repeat of the user ID; contain at
least one letter, and at least one number or special character must be in a position other than the
first or last one. This format will ensure that the password is hard to guess. Most systems are
capable of being configured to automatically enforce these requirements. Where a system does not
mechanically require this format, the users must manually follow the format.
9.7.5 Systems will require users to change their passwords regularly (usually every 31 days).
9.7.6 Systems are to be configured to prevent users from reusing the same password for 6
changes/months.
9.7.7 Personal passwords must not be shared. A user who has shared his password is responsible for any
use made of the password.
9.8 Access and Session Control
9.8.1 Destination restrictions will be enforced at remote access facilities used for access to OSS
Interfaces. These connections must be approved by each Party’s corporate security organization.
9.8.2 Terminals or other input devices must not be left unattended while they may be used for system
access. Upon completion of each work session, terminals or workstations must be properly logged
off.
9.9 User Authorization
9.9.1 On the destination system, users are granted access to specific resources (e.g. databases, files,
transactions, etc.). These permissions will usually be defined for an individual user (or user group)
when a user ID is approved for access to the system.

062907
9.10 Software and Data Integrity
9.10.1 Each Party shall use a comparable degree of care to protect the other Party’s software and data
from unauthorized access, additions, changes and deletions as it uses to protect its own similar
software and data. This may be accomplished by physical security at the work location and by
access control software on the workstation.
9.10.2 Untrusted software or data shall be scanned for viruses before use on a Party’s corporate facilities
that can be accessed through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS interfaces.
9.10.3 Unauthorized use of copyrighted software is prohibited on each Party’s corporate systems that can
be access through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS Interfaces.
9.10.4 Proprietary software or information (whether electronic or paper) of a Party shall not be given by the
other Party to unauthorized individuals. When it is no longer needed, each Party’s proprietary
software or information shall be returned by the other Party or disposed of securely. Paper copies
shall be shredded. Electronic copies shall be overwritten or degaussed.
9.11 Monitoring and Audit
9.11.1 To deter unauthorized access events, a warning or no trespassing message will be displayed at the
point of initial entry (i.e., network entry or applications with direct entry points). Each Party should
have several approved versions of this message. Users should expect to see a warning message
similar to this one:
"This is a (AT&T-13STATE or CLEC) system restricted to Company official business and subject to
being monitored at any time. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and
to any evidence of unauthorized access, use, or modification being used for criminal prosecution."
9.11.2 After successful authentication, each session will display the last logon date/time and the number of
unsuccessful logon attempts. The user is responsible for reporting discrepancies.
10. OPERATIONAL READINESS TEST (ORT) FOR ORDERING/PROVISIONING AND REPAIR/
MAINTENANCE INTERFACES
10.1 Prior to live access to interface functionality, the Parties must conduct Operational Readiness Testing
(ORT), which will allow for the testing of the systems, interfaces, and processes for the OSS functions. ORT
will be completed in conformance with agreed upon processes and implementation dates.
11. OSS TRAINING COURSES
11.1 Prior to initial live OSS interface usage, a CLEC that intends to utilize AT&T-13STATE interfaces must
complete user education classes for AT&T-13STATE-provided interfaces that affect the AT&T-13STATE
network. A separate agreement will be required as a commitment to enroll in training classes and to pay for
a specific number of CLEC students in each class. CLEC can obtain a copy of the proposed contract and
price list for these OSS classes from their CLEC account manager. Course descriptions and class
schedules, by region, are published on the CLEC website and/or will be available through their CLEC
account manager. CLEC training schedules are subject to change, with class lengths varying. Classes are
train-the-trainer format to enable CLEC to devise its own course work for its own employees.
12. OSS CHARGES FOR SYSTEM ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY
12.1 To the extent AT&T-13STATE seeks to recover costs associated with OSS System Access and
Connectivity, AT&T-13STATE shall not be foreclosed from seeking recovery of such costs via negotiation,
arbitration, or generic proceeding during the term of this agreement.
13. MISCELLANEOUS CHARGES
13.1 For AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE region only, CLEC requesting the Bill PlusTM, as described in
7.2.2, agrees to pay applicable tariffed rate, less Resale discount.

062907
13.2 For AT&T-12STATE, CLEC requesting the billing function for the Daily Usage Extract which contains the
usage billable records, as described in 7.2.4 and 7.3.2, agrees to pay established rates pursuant to
Appendix Pricing.
13.3 For AT&T-13STATE, should CLEC request custom development of an exclusive interface to support OSS
functions, such development will be considered by AT&T-13STATE on an Individual Case Basis (ICB) and
priced as such.
14. SERVICE BUREAU PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS FOR SHARED ACCESS TO OSS
14.1 AT&T-13STATE shall allow CLEC to access its OSS via a Service Bureau Provider under the following
terms and conditions:
14.2 Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement regarding access to OSS to the contrary, CLEC shall be
permitted to access AT&T-13STATE OSS via a Service Bureau Provider as follows:
14.2.1 CLEC shall be permitted to access AT&T-13STATE application-to-application OSS interfaces, via a
Service Bureau Provider where CLEC has entered into an agency relationship with such Service
Bureau Provider, and the Service Bureau Provider has executed an Agreement with AT&T-
13STATE to allow Service Bureau Provider to establish access to and use of AT&T-13STATE’s
OSS.
14.2.2 CLEC’s use of a Service Bureau Provider shall not relieve CLEC of the obligation to abide by all
terms and conditions of this Agreement. CLEC must ensure that its agent properly performs all OSS
obligations of CLEC under this Agreement, which CLEC delegates to Service Bureau Provider.
14.2.3 It shall be the obligation of CLEC to provide notice in accordance with the notice provisions of the
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement whenever it established an agency relationship with a
Service Bureau Provider or terminates such a relationship. AT&T-13STATE shall have a
reasonable transition time to establish a connection to a Service Bureau Provider once CLEC
provides notice. Additionally, AT&T-13STATE shall have a reasonable transition period to terminate
any such connection after notice from CLEC that it has terminated its agency relationship with a
Service Bureau Provider.
14.3 AT&T-13STATE shall not be obligated to pay liquidated damages or assessments for noncompliance with
a performance measurement to the extent that such noncompliance was the result of actions or events
beyond AT&T-13STATE's control associated with third-party systems or equipment including systems,
equipment and services provided by a Service Bureau Provider (acting as CLEC’s agent for connection to
AT&T-13STATE’s OSS) which could not be avoided by AT&T-13STATE through the exercise of
reasonable diligence or delays or other problems resulting from actions of a Service Bureau Provider,
including Service Bureau provided processes, services, systems or connectivity.

ASSISTANCE APPENDIX
1. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
1.1 This Appendix sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
Operator Services (OS) and Directory Assistance (DA) on a wholesale basis, regardless of whether CLEC is
serving its end users via
1.1.1 CLEC's own physical Switches,
1.1.2 Resale of AT&T-13STATE Retail OS/DA service, or
1.1.3 Leased Circuit Switching from AT&T-13STATE.
1.2 CLEC shall be the Retail OS/DA provider to its end users, and AT&T-13STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-13STATE shall answer CLEC’s end user OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.1 When the end user dials 0 or 0+ the Telephone Number, AT&T-13STATE shall provide the Operator
Services described in Section 4 below.
1.2.2 When the end user dials 4-1-1 or 1-4-1-1, AT&T-13STATE shall provide Directory Assistance as
described in Section 5 below.
1.3 CLEC is free to charge its end users whatever retail OS/DA rates it wishes, and CLEC therefore
acknowledges its responsibility (a) to obtain end user agreement to the OS/DA retail rates (i.e. by tariff or
contract), and (b) to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA retail rates.
1.4 In response to dialing end user inquiries about OS/DA rates, AT&T-13STATE Operators shall quote CLEC
retail OS/DA rates, as they are provided by CLEC (see Section 6 below). If further inquiries are made about
rates, billing and/or other “business office” questions, AT&T-13STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the
calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-provided contact number (also see Section 6 below).
1.5 AT&T-13STATE shall charge CLEC monthly, and CLEC agrees to pay monthly, the OS/DA rates found in the
attached Appendix Pricing. The Parties agree that billing and payment details, including the assessment of
late payment charges for unpaid balances, shall be governed by the underlying agreement between AT&T-
13STATE and CLEC.
1.5.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that these wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based1 service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the attached price
schedule. CLEC may serve both as a Reseller and as a facilities-based provider, and CLEC may
convert facilities-based end users to Resale service, or vice versa, as described below in section 6.8.
1.5.1.1 To the extent CLEC is serving as a Reseller and not a facilities-based provider, the facilities-
based OS/DA rates in the attached price schedule do not apply and are listed merely for
reference purposes.
1.5.1.2 To the extent CLEC is serving as a facilities-based provider and not as a Reseller, then the
Resale OS/DA rates in the attached price schedule do not apply and are listed merely for
reference purposes.
1.5.2 CLEC acknowledges and understands that AT&T-13STATE uses a different billing system for Resale
than for facilities-based service, and that if CLEC operates both as a Reseller and a facilities-based
provider, then CLEC will receive two different monthly invoices for OS/DA service from AT&T-
13STATE, one for Resale, and one for facilities-based service.
1By "facilities-based" the Parties mean either through CLEC's own switch, or via leased circuit switching from AT&T-13STATE.

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
072706
1.5.3 CLEC acknowledges and understands that the Resale OS/DA rates are based on AT&T-13STATE’s
tariffed retail OS/DA rates, less the state resale discount, and therefore may change during the life of
this Appendix OS/DA in a Resale Agreement, without written amendment, if
1.5.3.1 AT&T-13STATE’s retail tariff changes, or
1.5.3.2 The state resale discount changes.
2. GENERAL AT&T-13STATE OBLIGATIONS FOR WHOLESALE OS/DA SERVICE
2.1 Dialing Parity. AT&T-13STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s end users with no unreasonable dialing delays
and at dialing parity with AT&T-13STATE retail OS/DA services.
2.2 Response Parity
2.2.1 For Resale and Leased Circuit Switching, CLEC’s end users shall be answered by AT&T-13STATE’s
OS and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-13STATE’s
retail end users.
2.2.2 For Resale and Leased Circuit Switching, any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-13STATE
OS/DA platform (i.e. cable cuts in the OS/DA trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be
experienced at parity with AT&T-13STATE retail end users served via that same AT&T-13STATE end
office switch.
2.2.3 For all service types, AT&T-13STATE will include CLEC’s end user OS/DA calls in its speed of
response measurements reported to the state regulatory commission, if any.
2.3 Daily Usage File (DUF)
2.3.1 For Resale and Leased Circuit Switching, AT&T-13STATE will record CLEC’s OS/DA usage on its
Resale and Leased Circuit Switching lines and include that call detail in the Daily Usage File (DUF) as
described elsewhere in the underlying wholesale agreement, but at a minimum, the DUF shall be in
industry-standard Exchange Message Interface format and will be in compliance with the Ordering and
Billing Forum guidelines.
2.3.2 When CLEC is operating its own switch-based service, AT&T-13STATE will transmit similar usage
recorded by the AT&T-13STATE OS/DA switch via a mutually agreed electronic interface for CLEC’s
switch.
3. REQUIREMENTS FOR CIRCUIT SWITCHES TO PHYSICALLY INTERCONNECT
3.1 To the extent that CLEC is serving its own switches and wishes to interconnect with AT&T-13STATE’s OS/DA
switches, then the Parties’ physical interconnection and trunking requirements are described in this section.
All OS/DA interconnection and trunking arrangements shall be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties,
and any unresolved differences in the OS/DA physical interconnection or trunking arrangements shall be
handled pursuant to the Dispute Resolution provisions in the underlying agreement.
3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the Point of
Interconnection (POI) for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum
must be within the LATA in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve end users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that, for
purposes of this Appendix OS/DA only, CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of
the end user dialing “0” or “411”, and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the end
user dialing 0 or 411 shall be deemed the end user’s physical billing address, regardless of whether the
end user may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3 The Parties’ general preference would be to establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-13STATE’s
OS/DA switch in that LATA , but the Parties recognize that the demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the
Page 229 of 551

OS/DA APPENDIX/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 5 OF 8
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
072706
Parties’ networks could depend on a variety of engineering and location-specific factors which include, but are
not limited to,
3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic
3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for both OS and DA, or just OS, or just DA;
3.3.3 Whether CLEC OR CLEC’s affiliate has collocated in an AT&T-13STATE Local Tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
13STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.4 CLEC shall provide the necessary facilities to interconnect with AT&T-13STATE’s OS/DA switch(es) at a
mutually-agreeable demarcation point between the Parties’ networks. CLEC may self-provision these OS/DA
facilities, lease them from third parties, or lease them from AT&T-13STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff.
CLEC will be financially responsible for the OS/DA facilities on its side of the demarcation point, and AT&T-
13STATE will be financially responsible for the OS/DA facilities on its side of the demarcation point.
3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements
3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an ASR for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to the appropriate AT&T-13STATE
OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling.
Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-13STATE will provision all such one-way trunk groups in the same
manner and at the same intervals as for all other interconnection trunking between the parties.
3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-13STATE
End Offices to the AT&T-13STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10 Digit Signaling for
Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.5.3 If EAOSS is not technically feasible, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
13STATE OS/DA switch for each served NPA in the LATA.
3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups, and their Requirements
3.6.1 Operator Service (OS) Trunks. CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the
AT&T-13STATE Operator Services switch serving OS end users in that LATA. An OS only trunk
group will be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be designated with
a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC will have administrative control
for the purpose of issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group.
3.6.2 Directory Assistance (DA)/Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) Trunks. CLEC shall establish
a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-13STATE Directory Assistance switch serving
DA end users in that LATA. If the trunk group transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk
group will be designated with the appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier. If OS/DA/DACC is
transported together on a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with a different
appropriate traffic use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group.
3.6.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI) Trunks. When CLEC wishes for AT&T-13STATE
to perform Busy Line Verification or Emergency Interrupt for CLEC end users, AT&T-13STATE will
need a segregated one-way BLV trunk group with MF signaling from AT&T-13STATE’s Operator
Services switch to CLEC’s switch serving end users in that LATA. CLEC will have administrative
control for the purpose of issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group. The BLV trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate traffic use code and modifier.

4. SPECIFICS OF OS OFFERINGS AND RECURRING CHARGES
4.1 Operator Services Rate Structure. AT&T-13STATE will assess its Operator Services charges based upon
whether the CLEC end user is receiving (a) manual Operator Services (i.e., provided a live Operator), for
which a per work second charge will apply, or (b) automated Operator Services (i.e., an OS switch equipment
voice recognition feature, functioning either fully or partially without live Operators), where a flat rate per call
charge will apply. See the attached Appendix Pricing for the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
4.2 Operator Services Call Processing. Whether manual or automated, AT&T-13STATE will provide the following
services when processing a 0-dialed call from CLEC’s line, regardless of whether Directory Assistance is also
requested:
4.2.1 General Operator Assistance - The end user dialing 0 may ask the OS Operator to provide local and
intraLATA dialing assistance for the purposes of completing calls, or requesting information on how to
place calls; handling emergency calls, handling credits.
4.2.2 Calling Card - The end user dialing 0 may provide the OS Operator with a Calling Card number for
billing purposes, and seek assistance in completing the call.
4.2.3 Collect - The end user dialing 0 may ask the OS Operator to bill the charges associated with the call to
the called number, provided such billing is accepted by the called number.
4.2.4 Third Number Billed - The end user dialing 0 may ask the OS Operator to bill the call to a different
number than the calling or called number.
4.2.5 Person-To-Person Service - The end user dialing 0 may ask the OS Operator for assistance in
reaching a particular person or a particular PBX station, department or office to be reached through a
PBX attendant. This service applies even if the caller agrees, after the connection is established, to
speak to any party other than the party previously specified.
4.2.6 Busy Line Verification - A service in which the end user dialing 0 will ask the OS Operator to check the
requested line for conversation in progress and advise the caller of the status.
4.2.7 Busy Line Interrupt - A service in which the end user dialing 0 asks the Operator to interrupt a
conversation in progress, to determine if one of the parties is willing to speak to the caller requesting
the interrupt.
5. SPECIFICS OF DA OFFERING AND RECURRING CHARGE
5.1 Directory Assistance Rate Structure. AT&T-13STATE charges local DA by one rate, and all other DA
products by a separate rate. In both cases DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call
duration. See the attached Appendix Pricing for the DA recurring and nonrecurring rates.
5.2 Directory Assistance Call Processing. Where technically feasible and/or available, AT&T-13STATE will
provide the following DA Services when a CLEC end user served dials 411 or 1-411, regardless of whether
Operator Services are also requested from AT&T-13STATE:
5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance. Consists of providing published name, address and telephone number to
the dialing end user.
5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC). A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to the
requested number is completed on behalf of the DA end user, utilizing an automated voice system or
with operator assistance.
5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA). A service whereby callers may request Directory Assistance
outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the United States.
5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA). An Information Service consisting of providing listed local and
national name and address information associated with a telephone number provided by the individual
originating the call.

5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) (Where Available). A service in which the end user may request
business telephone number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the
business is not known. Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
6. OS/DA NON-RECURRING CHARGES FOR LOADING AUTOMATED CALL GREETING (I.E. BRAND
ANNOUNCEMENT), RATES AND REFERENCE INFORMATION
6.1 The incoming OS/DA call is automatically answered by a pre-recorded greeting loaded into the OS/DA switch
itself, prior to being handled by automated equipment or a live operator. It is not technically feasible to avoid
the automatic pre-recorded announcement function in these OS/DA switches, therefore CLEC agrees that it
shall establish a pre-recorded greeting to play for every OS or DA call dialed by CLEC’s end user, and this
greeting is mandatory, not optional, when AT&T-13STATE is the OS/DA provider.
6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-13STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T-13STATE CLEC website (https//:clec.att.com/clec).
6.1.2 AT&T-13STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded announcement at
any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner, for subsequent loading and
testing charges.
6.2 If CLEC does not wish to brand the OS/DA calls, CLEC may also have their end user hear silence upon
connecting with the OS/DA switch by having AT&T-13STATE load a recording of silence into the automatic,
pre-recorded announcement slot, set for the shortest possible duration allowed by the switch, to then be
routed to automated or live operators as with all other OS/DA calls, for which brand loading charges will still
apply.
6.2.1 CLEC understands that silent announcements may not be perceived by dialing end users as ordinary
mechanical handling of OS/DA calls.
6.2.2 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-13STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify the
OS/DA provider to the dialing end user.
6.2.3 AT&T-13STATE must make the silent recording play for the shortest possible duration technically
feasible for each applicable OS/DA switch, but otherwise has no responsibility if a silent announcement
is chosen by CLEC.
6.3 AT&T-13STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided recording or the silent announcement into
all applicable OS and/or DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity
with that provided to AT&T-13STATE retail end users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial
recording or silent announcement loading charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any
subsequent loading charges if a new recordings or silent announcements are provided as specified above.
6.4 Branding/Silent Announcement load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. (For
example, a CLEC Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facility-based operations, and
therefore two separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the Branding/Silent
Announcement charge). These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the attached Appendix
Pricing.
6.5 In all current AT&T-13STATE OS/DA switches, the applicable CLEC-charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-
provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office or repair call center) are loaded into the
system utilized by the OS/DA Operator.
6.6 AT&T-13STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC-provided
contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate
loading charges.

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
072706
6.7 Rate/Reference load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, per OCN, per state. (For
example, a CLEC Reseller may choose to rate differently than its facility-based CLEC operations, or may
change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore separate sets of rates/references
could be loaded for each OCN, per state, each loading incurring the Rate/Reference charge). These charges
are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the attached Appendix Pricing.
6.8 Converting End Users from Prior Branded Service to CLEC or Silent-Branded Service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service.
6.8.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-13STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no Non-Recurring
Charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale service to facilities-
based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
6.8.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in AT&T-
13STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then Non-Recurring Charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in section 6 above, and at
the rates set forth in the attached Appendix Pricing.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1 For purposes of this Appendix, OE-LEC intends to operate and/or provide telecommunications services
outside of AT&T-13STATE incumbent local exchange areas and desires to interconnect OE-LEC’s
network with AT&T-13STATE’s network(s).
2.2 For purposes of this Appendix, OE-LEC agrees to interconnect with AT&T-13STATE pursuant to
Section 251(a) of the Act.
2.3 Other attachments in this Agreement set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-
13STATE agrees to provide CLEC with access to lawful unbundled network elements (Lawful UNEs)
under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6) of the Act, Interconnection
under Section 251(c)(2) of the Act and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) of the Act in AT&T-
13STATE's incumbent local exchange areas for the provision of CLEC's Telecommunications Services.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-13STATE is only obligated to make available Lawful
UNEs and access to Lawful UNEs under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under Section
251(c)(6) of the Act, Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) of the Act and/or Resale under Section

rates, terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and any associated provisions set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement (including but not limited to the rates set forth in this Agreement
associated with Lawful UNEs under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6) of
the Act, Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) of the Act and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) of the
Act), shall apply only to the Parties and be available to CLEC for provisioning telecommunication
services within an AT&T-13STATE incumbent local exchange area(s) in the State in which CLEC's
current Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-13STATE has been approved by the relevant state
Commission and is in effect.
3. NETWORK MANAGEMENT
3.1 Each Party to this Appendix will be responsible for the accuracy and quality of its data as submitted to
the respective Parties involved. Where SS7 connections exist, each Party will include the Calling Party
Number (CPN) that truly and accurately reflect the location of the end user that originated and/or dialed
the call in the information transmitted to the other for each call being terminated on the other’s network.
If one Party is passing CPN but the other Party is not properly receiving CPN, the Parties will work
cooperatively to correct the problem. Where SS7 connections exist and the percentage of calls passed
with CPN is greater than ninety percent (90%), all calls without CPN exchanged between the Parties
will be billed as either Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, FX Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, or
intraLATA Toll Traffic in direct proportion to the minutes of use (MOU) of calls exchanged with CPN. If
the percentage of calls passed with CPN is less than ninety percent (90%), all calls passed without
CPN will be billed as intraLATA switched access.
3.2 The Parties will work cooperatively to implement this Appendix. The Parties will exchange appropriate
information (for example, maintenance contact numbers, network information, information required to
comply with law enforcement and other security agencies of the Government, escalation processes,
etc.) to achieve this desired result.
3.3 Each Party will administer its network to ensure acceptable service levels to all users of its network
services. Service levels are generally considered acceptable only when End Users are able to
establish connections with little or no delay encountered in the network. Each Party will provide a 24-
hour contact number for network traffic management issues to the other's surveillance management
center.
3.4 Each Party maintains the right to implement protective network traffic management controls, such as
"cancel to", "call gapping" or 7-digit and 10-digit code gaps, to selectively cancel the completion of
traffic over its network, including traffic destined for the other Party’s network, when required to protect
the public-switched network from congestion as a result of occurrences such as facility failures, switch
congestion or failure or focused overload. Each Party shall immediately notify the other Party of any
protective control action planned or executed.
3.5 Where the capability exists, either Party may implement originating or terminating traffic reroutes to
temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling patterns. Reroutes
shall not be used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Such alternative routing shall be used only
when mutually agreed to by the Parties.
3.6 The Parties shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding cross-network call-ins
expected to generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes to prevent or mitigate the
impact of these events on the public-switched network, including any disruption or loss of service to the
other Party’s End Users. Facsimile (FAX) numbers must be exchanged by the Parties to facilitate event
notifications for planned mass calling events.
3.7 The Parties agree that, unless otherwise mutually negotiated, the quality of such network connections
shall be equal to that of the existing facilities that are jointly provided by each Party.
3.8 Joint planning and forecasting responsibilities shall be governed by the underlying agreement.

4. NETWORK CONNECTIONS FOR OUT OF EXCHANGE TRAFFIC
4.1 OE-LEC represents that it operates as a CLEC within AT&T-13STATE exchange areas and has a Point
of Interconnection (“POI”) located within AT&T-13STATE exchange areas for the purpose of providing
telephone exchange service and exchange access in such AT&T-13STATE exchange areas. Based
upon the foregoing, the Parties agree that AT&T-13STATE’s originating traffic will be delivered to OE-
LEC’s existing POI arrangements in the LATA where the traffic originates in accordance with the POI
requirements set forth in this Agreement. AT&T-13STATE will accept OE-LEC’s Out of Exchange
Traffic at its tandem switch over local interconnection facilities that currently exist or may exist in the
future between the Parties to or from OE-LEC’s out of exchange areas to or from AT&T-13STATE’s
end offices. When such Out of Exchange Traffic is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that
is exchanged between the end users of OE-LEC and AT&T-13STATE, the Parties agree to establish a
direct end office trunk group when traffic levels exceed one DS1 (24 DS0s) to or from an AT&T-
13STATE End Office.
4.2 The Parties agree, that at a minimum, OE-LEC shall establish a trunk group for Out of Exchange Traffic
from OE-LEC to each AT&T-13STATE serving tandem in a LATA. This requirement may be waived
upon mutual agreement of the parties.
4.3 Transport facilities for 911, mass calling, OS/DA and Meet Point trunking are the responsibility of OE-
LEC from OE-LEC to the serving tandem or platform that provides each such service type.
4.4 OE-LEC shall route originating Out of Exchange Traffic to the serving tandem as defined by the tandem
owner in the LERG.
4.5 If AT&T-13STATE is not the serving tandem as reflected in the LERG, the OE-LEC shall route Out of
Exchange Traffic directly to the serving AT&T-13STATE End Office.
4.6 Except as otherwise provided in this Appendix, for OE-LEC originated/AT&T-13STATE terminated
traffic or AT&T-13STATE originated/ OE-LEC terminated traffic, if any such traffic is improperly routed
by one Party over any trunk groups to other party and/or not routed in accordance with this Appendix,
the Parties will work cooperatively to correct the problem.
4.7 AT&T-13STATE shall not compensate any Third Party local exchange carrier and/or
Telecommunications Carrier for any traffic that is inappropriately routed to AT&T-13STATE (as
reflected in the LERG). Any compensation due AT&T-13STATE for such misrouted traffic shall be paid
by OE-LEC. The appropriateness of such routing and the correct AT&T-13STATE serving tandems are
reflected by AT&T-13STATE in the LERG. This also includes traffic that is destined to End Offices that
do not subtend AT&T-13STATE tandem. AT&T-13STATE shall provide notice to OE-LEC pursuant to
the Notices provisions of this Agreement that such misrouting has occurred. In the notice, OE-LEC
shall be given thirty (30) calendar days to cure such misrouting.
4.8 Neither Party shall deliver traffic destined to terminate at the other Party’s End Office via a Third Party
ILEC’s End Office or Tandem.
4.9 Connection of a trunk group from OE-LEC to AT&T-13STATE’s tandem(s) will provide OE-LEC
accessibility to End Offices, IXCs, LECs, WSPs and NXXs which subtend that tandem(s). Connection
of a trunk group from one Party to the other Party’s End Office(s) will provide the connecting Party
accessibility only to the NXXs served by that individual End Office(s) to which the connecting Party
interconnects. Direct End Office Trunk groups that connect the Parties End Office(s) shall provide the
Parties accessibility only to the NXXs that are served by that End Office(s).
4.10 AT&T-13STATE will open OE-LEC NPA-NXX codes, rated to or identified to reside in non-AT&T-
13STATE exchange areas, in AT&T-13STATE Tandems and End Offices using AT&T-13STATE’s
standard code opening timeframes.

5. INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION
5.1 The compensation arrangement for Out of Exchange traffic exchanged between the Parties shall be as
set forth in the Appendix Intercarrier Compensation.
6. INTERLATA SECTION 251(B)(5) TRAFFIC
6.1 AT&T-13STATE will exchange AT&T-13STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic that is covered by
an FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver. AT&T-13STATE will exchange such
traffic using two-way direct final trunk groups (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI in the originating LATA,
or (ii) via a facility meet point arrangement at or near the exchange area boundary (“EAB”), (iii) via a
mutually agreed to meet point facility within the AT&T-13STATE exchange area covered under such
InterLATA waiver, or (iv) via another mutually agreeable method. If the exchange where the traffic is
terminating is not an AT&T-13STATE exchange, AT&T-13STATE shall exchange such traffic using a
two-way DF trunk group (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI within the originating LATA, (ii) via a mutually
agreed to facility meet point arrangement at or near the EAB, or (iii) via another mutually agreeable
method. AT&T-13STATE will not provision or be responsible for facilities located outside of AT&T-
13STATE exchange areas.
6.2 The Parties agree that the associated traffic from each AT&T-13STATE End Office will not alternate
route.
6.3 OE-LEC must provide AT&T-13STATE a separate ACTL and Local Routing Number (LRN) specific to
each InterLATA local calling arrangement covered by an FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA
boundary waiver.
6.4 Except as otherwise provided in this Appendix, for OE-LEC originated/AT&T-13STATE terminated
traffic or AT&T-13STATE originated/OE-LEC terminated traffic, if any such traffic is improperly routed
by one Party over any trunk groups to other party and/or not routed in accordance with this Appendix,
the Parties will work cooperatively to correct the problem.
6.5 AT&T-13STATE shall not compensate any Third Party local exchange carrier and/or
Telecommunications Carrier for any traffic that is inappropriately routed to AT&T-13STATE (as
reflected in the LERG). Any compensation due AT&T-13STATE for such misrouted traffic shall be paid
by OE-LEC. The appropriateness of such routing and the correct AT&T-13STATE serving tandems are
reflected by AT&T-13STATE in the LERG. This also includes traffic that is destined to End Offices that
do not subtend AT&T-13STATE tandem. AT&T-13STATE shall provide notice to OE-LEC pursuant to
the Notices provisions of this Agreement that such misrouting has occurred. In the notice, OE-LEC
shall be given thirty (30) calendar days to cure such misrouting.
6.6 AT&T-13STATE will open OE-LEC NPA-NXX codes, rated to or identified to reside in non-AT&T-
13STATE exchange areas, in AT&T-13STATE Tandems and End Office(s) using AT&T-13STATE’s
standard code opening timeframes.
6.7 The compensation arrangement for InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic shall be governed by the
compensation terms and conditions for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic in the Appendix Intercarrier
Compensation.

APPENDIX INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION
1. SCOPE OF APPENDIX
1.1 This Appendix sets forth the terms and conditions for Intercarrier Compensation of intercarrier
telecommunications traffic exchanged between the applicable AT&T Inc. (AT&T) owned Incumbent Local
Exchange Carrier and CLEC, but only to the extent they are interconnected and exchanging calls pursuant
to a fully executed, underlying Interconnection Agreement approved by the applicable state or federal

3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES
3.1 For all traffic originated on a Party’s network including, without limitation, Switched Access Traffic such
Party shall provide Calling Party Number (CPN) as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1600(c) (“CPN”) in accordance
with Section 3.3 below. CPN shall, at a minimum, include information in an industry recognized standard
Page 243 of 551

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION (ALL TRAFFIC)/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 5 OF 17
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
format, consistent with the requirements of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) containing a
unique three digit area code (NPA) and seven digit (NXX-XXXX) telephone number. Each Party to this
Agreement will be responsible for passing on any CPN it receives from a third party for traffic delivered to
the other Party. In addition, each Party agrees that it shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or
incorrectly assign any CPN. If either party identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange
services (including, but not limited to PRI, ISDN and/or Smart Trunks), or identifies stripped, altered,
modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, the Parties agree to cooperate with
one another to investigate and take corrective action.
3.2 If one Party is passing CPN but the other Party is not properly receiving information, the Parties will work
cooperatively to correct the problem.
3.3 For traffic which is delivered by one Party to be terminated on the other Party’s network in AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT, if the
percentage of such calls passed with CPN is greater than ninety percent (90%), all calls delivered by one
Party to the other for termination without CPN will be billed as either Section 251(b)(5) Traffic or IntraLATA
Toll Traffic in direct proportion to the total MOUs of calls delivered by one Party to the other with CPN. If
the percentage of calls passed with CPN is less than 90%, all calls delivered by one Party to the other
without CPN will be billed at Intrastate Switched Access rates.
3.4 For those usage based charges where actual charge information is not determinable by AT&T-2STATE
because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the traffic is unidentifiable, the Parties will
jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate charges to be
billed to the terminating party in accordance with Section 13.2 below.
3.5 CLEC has the sole obligation to enter into intercarrier compensation arrangements with third party
telecommunications carriers regarding CLEC’s traffic and such other carriers’ traffic, including without
limitation any where CLEC originates traffic to or terminates traffic from an End User being served by a third
party telecommunications carrier who has purchased local switching from AT&T-13STATE on a wholesale
basis (non-resale) which is used by such telecommunications carrier to provide wireline local telephone
exchange (dialtone) service to its End Users. In no event will AT&T-13STATE have any liability to CLEC or
any third party if CLEC fails to enter into such compensation arrangements. In the event that traffic is
exchanged with a third party carrier with whom CLEC does not have a traffic compensation agreement,
CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-13STATE against any and all losses including
without limitation, charges levied by such third party carrier. The third party carrier and CLEC will bill their
respective charges directly to each other. AT&T-13STATE will not be required to function as a billing
intermediary, e.g., clearinghouse. AT&T-13STATE may provide information regarding such traffic to other
telecommunications carriers or entities as appropriate to resolve traffic compensation issues.
3.6 The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the classification of traffic under this Appendix, either Party is free
to define its own “local” calling area(s) for purposes of its provision of telecommunications services to its
End Users.
3.7 For Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, and IntraLATA Toll Traffic, the Party
whose End User originates such traffic shall compensate the Party who terminates such traffic to its End
User for the transport and termination of such traffic at the applicable rate(s) provided in this Appendix and
Appendix Pricing and/or the applicable switched access tariffs. In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC
purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a wholesale basis to provide service to its End
Users, all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, and IntraLATA Toll Traffic
originated by CLEC’s End Users are not subject to intercarrier compensation as addressed in Section 4.7.3
below.
3.8 To the extent that the Parties are not currently exchanging traffic in a given LATA or Local Calling Area, the
Parties’ obligation to pay intercarrier compensation to each other shall commence on the date the Parties
agree that the interconnection is complete (i.e., each Party has established its originating trunks as well as
all ancillary traffic trunking such as Operator Services, 911 or Mass Calling trunks) and is capable of fully
Page 244 of 551

supporting originating and terminating End User customers’ traffic. In addition, the Parties agree that test
traffic is not subject to compensation pursuant to this Appendix Intercarrier Compensation.
3.9 The Parties acknowledge that this Attachment addresses solely the method of compensation for traffic
properly exchanged by the Parties under this Agreement. This Attachment is not meant to address whether
the Parties are obligated to exchange any specific type of traffic, nor the types of services to be offered by
AT&T-13STATE pursuant to this agreement.
3.9.1 More specifically, and without limiting the foregoing Section 3.9, the parties acknowledge that this
Attachment does not address “Out of Exchange Traffic” with an “Out of Exchange-LEC.” The Parties
acknowledge that they have agreed upon terms and conditions for the exchange of such traffic, as
provided for in Appendix OE-LEC hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, “Out of Exchange LEC”
(OE-LEC) means a CLEC operating within AT&T-13STATE’s incumbent local exchange area and
also providing telecommunications services in another ILEC’s incumbent local exchange area that
shares mandatory or optional calling with AT&T-13STATE. For purposes of this Agreement, “Out of
Exchange Traffic” is defined as Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, FX Traffic, Optional
EAS Traffic, MCA Traffic, IntraLATA Toll Traffic and/or InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic
exchanged pursuant to an FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver that:
(i) Originates from an OE-LEC End User located in another ILEC’s incumbent local exchange area
and terminates to an AT&T-13STATE End User located in an AT&T-13STATE local exchange
area or;
(ii) Originates from an AT&T-13STATE End User located in an AT&T-13STATE local exchange
area and terminates to an OE-LEC End User located in another ILEC’s incumbent local
exchange area.
4. RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR TERMINATION OF SECTION 251(b)(5) TRAFFIC
4.1 Section 251(b)(5) Traffic shall mean telecommunications traffic in which the originating End User of one
Party and the terminating End User of the other Party are:
a. both physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or
"General") Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state commission or regulatory agency; or
b. both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same
common mandatory local calling area. This includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area
Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service (ELCS), or other types of mandatory
expanded local calling scopes.
4.2 AT&T-12STATE made an offer (the “Offer”) to all telecommunications carriers to exchange Section
251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic on and after the designated dates provided below pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan of the FCC’s Order on
Remand and Report and Order, In the Matter of Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket
Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel. April 27, 2001) ) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”) which was remanded but not
vacated in WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 01-1218 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
AT&T-13STATE and CLEC agree to carry out the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan on the
date designated by AT&T-13STATE in a particular state without waiving, and expressly reserving, all
appellate rights to contest FCC, judicial, legislative, or other regulatory rulings regarding ISP-Bound traffic,
including but not limited to, appeals of the FCC's ISP Compensation Order. By agreeing to this Appendix,
both Parties reserve the right to advocate their respective positions before courts, state or federal
commissions, or legislative bodies.
4.2.1 Should a regulatory agency, court or legislature change or nullify the AT&T-13STATE's designated
date to begin billing under the FCC's ISP terminating compensation plan, then the Parties also agree
that any necessary billing true ups, reimbursements, or other accounting adjustments shall be made
symmetrically and to the same date that the FCC terminating compensation plan was deemed
Page 245 of 551

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION (ALL TRAFFIC)/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 7 OF 17
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
applicable to all traffic in that state exchanged under Section 251(b)(5) of the Act. By way of
interpretation, and without limiting the application of the foregoing, the Parties intend for retroactive
compensation adjustments, to the extent they are ordered by Intervening Law, to apply uniformly to
all traffic among AT&T-13STATE, CLEC and Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) carriers in
the state where traffic is exchanged as Local Calls within the meaning of this Appendix.
4.2.2 The Parties further acknowledge that federal or state court challenges could be sustained against
the FCC's ISP Compensation Order in particular, or against ISP intercarrier compensation generally.
In particular, a court could order an injunction, stay or other retroactive ruling on ISP compensation
back to the effective date of the FCC's ISP Compensation Order. Alternatively, a court could vacate
the underlying Order upon which the compensation was based, and the FCC (either on remand or
on its own motion) could rule that past traffic should be paid at different rates, terms or conditions.
Because of these possibilities, the Parties agree that should the ISP Compensation Order be
modified or reversed in such a manner that prior intercarrier compensation was paid under rates,
terms or conditions later found to be null and void, then the Parties agree that, in addition to
negotiating appropriate amendments to conform to such modification or reversal, the Parties will also
agree that any billing true ups, reimbursements, or other accounting adjustments on past traffic shall
be made uniformly and on the same date as for all traffic exchanged under Section 251(b)(5) of the
Act. By way of interpretation, and without limiting the application of the foregoing, the Parties intend
for retroactive compensation adjustments, to apply to all traffic among AT&T-13STATE, CLEC, and
CMRS carriers in the state where traffic is exchanged as Local Calls within the meaning of this
Appendix.
4.3 In AT&T-12STATE the rates, terms and conditions for compensation of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, as
defined in Section 4.1 and ISP-Bound Traffic, as defined in Section 5.1 will be compensated at the FCC’s
interim ISP terminating compensation rate as set forth in Section 5.3.2 below in a specific state on the later
of (i) the Effective Date of this Agreement and (ii) the effective date of the offer in a particular state. The
Parties acknowledge that AT&T-12STATE has made such offer in its respective states of (i) Indiana, Ohio,
Texas and Wisconsin effective on and after June 1, 2003; (ii) Arkansas and Michigan effective on and after
July 6, 2003; (iii) California effective on and after August 1, 2003; (iv) Illinois effective on and after
September 1, 2003; and (v) Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Nevada on and after June 1, 2004. Until and
unless AT&T CONNECTICUT chooses to offer to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound
Traffic on and after a designated date pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP
terminating compensation plan, the compensation set forth below in Section 4 will apply to all Section
251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic as for that particular state.
4.4 In instances where the originating carrier is originating telecommunications traffic over its own facilities,
(i.e., not leased or purchased from AT&T-13STATE), the following tandem serving rate elements are
applicable on a terminating MOU basis and includes compensation for the following sub-elements:
4.4.1 Tandem Switching - compensation for the use of tandem switching only consisting of a duration (per
minute) rate element.
4.4.2 Tandem Transport - compensation for the transmission of traffic between the local tandem and the
end offices subtending that tandem consisting of a transport termination (per minute) rate element
and transport facility mileage (per minute, per mile) rate element.
4.4.3 End Office Switching in a Tandem Serving Arrangement - compensation for the local end office
switching and line termination necessary to complete the transmission in a tandem-served
arrangement. It consists of a call set-up rate (per message) and a call duration (per minute) rate.
4.5 In instances where the originating carrier is originating telecommunications traffic over its own facilities,
(i.e., not leased or purchased from AT&T-13STATE), the following end office switching rate elements are
applicable on a terminating MOU basis::
4.5.1 End Office Switching - compensation for the local end office switching and line termination
necessary to complete the transmission in an end office serving arrangement. It consists of a call
set-up rate (per message) and a call duration (per minute) rate.

4.6 CLEC shall only be paid End Office Serving Rate Elements.
4.7 Intercarrier Compensation for Wholesale Local Switching Traffic
4.7.1 Where CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE on a wholesale basis, CLEC will deal
directly with third party carriers for purposes of reciprocal compensation for calls originated by or
terminated to the End Users served by such arrangements. AT&T-12STATE is required to provide
CLEC with timely, complete and correct information to enable CLEC to meet the requirements of this
section.
4.7.2 The following reciprocal compensation terms shall apply to all traffic exchanged between AT&T-
12STATE and CLECs when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE on a wholesale
basis:
4.7.2.1 For intra-switch Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between AT&T-
12STATE and CLEC, the Parties agree to impose no call termination charges pertaining to
reciprocal compensation on each other.
4.7.2.2 For interswitch Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between AT&T-
12STATE and CLEC where CLEC’s End User originates a call that is terminated to a AT&T-
12STATE End User, such traffic shall be paid for reciprocally at the FCC Plan rate set forth
in Section 5.3.2 for the transport and termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, and ISP-Bound
Traffic.
4.7.3 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a
wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users, AT&T CONNECTICUT will be solely responsible
for compensating the terminating third party carrier for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic,
Optional EAS Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic that originates from CLEC’s End Users. When CLEC
purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a wholesale basis, CLEC can not seek
intercarrier compensation from AT&T CONNECTICUT for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic that originates from either an AT&T
CONNECTICUT End User or a third party carrier’s End User.
5. RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF FCC’S INTERIM ISP TERMINATING COMPENSATION PLAN
5.1 In accordance with the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order, In the Matter of Implementation of
the Local Compensation Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for
ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel. April, 27, 2001) (“FCC ISP
Compensation Order”), “ISP-Bound Traffic” shall mean telecommunications traffic exchanged between
CLEC and AT&T-13STATE in which the originating End User of one Party and the ISP served by the other
Party are:
a. both physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC’s Local (or
“General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state commission or regulatory agency; or
b. both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same
common mandatory local calling area. This includes, but it is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area
Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service (ELCS) or other types of mandatory
expanded local calling scopes.
In states in which AT&T-13STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound traffic
pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the FCC ISP Compensation
Order, traffic is presumed to be ISP-Bound Traffic in accordance with the rebuttable presumption set forth in
Section 5.4 of this Appendix.
5.2 The Parties hereby agree that the following rates, terms and conditions set forth in Section 5 shall apply to
the termination of all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and all ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between the Parties in
each of the applicable state(s) AT&T-13STATE has made an offer as described in Section 4 above
Page 247 of 551

062907
effective on the later of (i) the Effective Date of this Agreement and (ii) the effective date of the offer in the
particular state and all ISP-Bound Traffic is subject to the rebuttable presumption.
5.3 Intercarrier Compensation for all ISP-Bound Traffic and Section 251(b)(5) Traffic
5.3.1 The rates, terms, and conditions in Section 5 apply to the termination of all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic
as defined in Section 4.1 and ISP-Bound Traffic as defined in Section 5.1 and ISP-Bound Traffic is
subject to the rebuttable presumption.
5.3.2 The Parties agree to compensate each other for the transport and termination of all Section
251(b)(5) and ISP-Bound Traffic and traffic on a minute of use basis, at $.0007 per minute of use.
5.3.3 Payment of Intercarrier Compensation on ISP-Bound Traffic and Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will not
vary according to whether the traffic is routed through a tandem switch or directly to an end office
switch.
5.4 ISP-Bound Traffic Rebuttable Presumption
5.4.1 In accordance with Paragraph 79 of the FCC’s ISP Compensation Order, the Parties agree that
there is a rebuttable presumption that any of the combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound
Traffic exchanged between the Parties exceeding a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio is presumed
to be ISP-Bound Traffic subject to the compensation terms in this Section 5.4. Either Party has the
right to rebut the 3:1 ISP-Bound Traffic presumption by identifying the actual ISP-Bound Traffic by
any means mutually agreed by the Parties, or by any method approved by the Commission. If a
Party seeking to rebut the presumption takes appropriate action at the Commission pursuant to
Section 252 of the Act and the Commission agrees that such Party has rebutted the presumption,
the methodology and/or means approved by the Commission for use in determining the ratio shall be
utilized by the Parties as of the date of the Commission approval. During the pendency of any such
proceedings to rebut the presumption, the Parties will remain obligated to pay the rates set forth in
Section 5.3.2 for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic.
5.5 For purposes of this Section 5.5, all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and all ISP-Bound Traffic shall be referred to
as “Billable Traffic” and will be billed in accordance with Section 13.0 below.
5.5.1 Each party will invoice the other party on a monthly basis for combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and
ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between the Parties at the rate set forth in Section 5.3.2.
6. OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
6.1 Except as set forth in Section 5 above, the terms of this appendix are not applicable to (i) interstate or
intrastate Exchange Access traffic, (ii) Information Access traffic, or (iii) any other type of traffic found to be
exempt from reciprocal compensation by the FCC or the Commission, with the exception of ISP-Bound
Traffic which is addressed in this Appendix. All Exchange Access traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall
continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable federal and state tariffs.
6.2 Foreign Exchange (FX) services are retail service offerings purchased by FX customers which allow such
FX customers to obtain exchange service from a mandatory local calling area other than the mandatory
local calling area where the FX customer is physically located, but within the same LATA as the number
that is assigned. FX service enables particular end-user customers to avoid what might otherwise be toll
calls between the FX customer’s physical location and customers in the foreign exchange. FX Telephone
Numbers” are those telephone numbers with rating and routing point that are different from those of the
geographic area in which the End User is physically located. FX Telephone Numbers that deliver second
dial tone and the ability for the calling party to enter access codes and an additional recipient telephone
number remain classified as Feature Group A (FGA) calls, and are subject to the originating and
terminating carrier’s tariffed Switched Exchange Access rates (also known as “Meet Point Billed”
compensation). There are two types of FX service:
6.2.1 “Dedicated FX Traffic” shall mean those calls routed by means of a physical, dedicated circuit
delivering dial tone or otherwise serving an End User’s station from a serving Central Office (also

known as End Office) located outside of that station’s mandatory local calling area. Dedicated FX
Service permits the End User physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone numbers
resident in the serving Central (or End) Office in another, “foreign,” exchange, thereby creating a
local presence in that “foreign” exchange.
6.2.2 “Virtual Foreign Exchange (FX) Traffic” and “FX-type Traffic” shall refer to those calls delivered to
telephone numbers that are rated as local to the other telephone numbers in a given mandatory local
calling area, but where the recipient End User’s station assigned that telephone number is physically
located outside of that mandatory local calling area. Virtual FX Service also permits an End User
physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone numbers resident in the serving
Central (or End) Office in another, “foreign,” exchange, thereby creating a local presence in the
“foreign” exchange. Virtual FX Service differs from Dedicated FX Service, however, in that Virtual
FX End Users continue to draw dial tone or are otherwise served from a Central (or End) Office
which may provide service across more than one Commission-prescribed mandatory local calling
area, whereas Dedicated FX Service End Users draw dial tone or are otherwise served from a
Central (or End) Office located outside their mandatory calling area.
6.2.3 FX Traffic is not Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and instead the transport and termination compensation for
FX Traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement in AT&T-12STATE.
6.2.3.1 To the extent that ISP-Bound Traffic is provisioned via an FX-type arrangement, such traffic
is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement. “Bill and Keep” refers to an arrangement in which
neither of two interconnecting parties charges the other for terminating FX traffic that
originates on the other party’s network.
6.2.4 Intentionally left blank
6.2.5 Pursuant to the Connecticut Commission Arbitration Award in Docket. 01-01-29RE01, the originating
Party will bill the terminating Party the appropriate originating access charges for all traffic, except
ISP-Bound Traffic, that is terminated to a number that is provisioned as a Virtual FX, Dedicated FX
or FX-type service as defined in Section 6.2 above in AT&T CONNECTICUT. In such
circumstances, for ISP-Bound Traffic the appropriate compensation mechanism is bill and keep.
6.2.6 Segregating and Tracking FX Traffic
6.2.6.1 For AT&T-12STATE, the terminating carrier is responsible for separately identifying
IntraLATA Virtual FX, Dedicated FX, and FX-type Traffic from other types of Intercarrier
traffic for compensation purposes. The terminating carrier will be responsible for providing
the originating carrier with an FX Usage Summary which includes a ten (10) digit telephone
number level detail of the minutes of use terminated to FX Telephone Numbers on its
network each month (or in each applicable billing period, if not billed monthly), or by any
means mutually agreed by the Parties.
6.2.6.2 Terminating carrier will not assess compensation charges to the Voice FX MOU and ISP FX
MOU in AT&T-12STATE.
6.2.6.3 Intentionally left blank
6.2.6.4 For AT&T CONNECTICUT, FX traffic must be identified as voice FX and ISP FX. AT&T
CONNECTICUT will work with CLEC in reviewing its data to determine the volume of
IntraLATA FX traffic being exchanged for an agreed-upon period of time. The parties may
agree to use traffic studies, retail sales of Dedicated FX lines, or any other agreed method of
estimating the FX traffic to be assigned a factor. Once the data review is completed, the
Parties will estimate the percentage of minutes of use that is attributable to FX traffic. For
AT&T CONNECTICUT ISP FX percentage will be assigned (“PIFX”) and voice FX
percentage will be assigned (“PVFX”). The PIFX and PVFX (“FX factor”) will be used in lieu
of providing the actual minutes of use data. This plan will be applied on an individual CLEC
basis.

6.2.6.4.1 The FX factor will be applied to the measured local usage minutes of use (“MOU”)
and result in the following billing adjustments:
(i) Terminating carrier will multiply the measured local MOU by the FX factor to
calculate the IntraLATA FX traffic.
(ii) Terminating carrier will subtract both the voice FX MOU and ISP FX MOU
from the measured local MOU.
(iii) Terminating carrier will apply the appropriate compensation rate to the
adjusted local MOU for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, and ISP-Bound Traffic, as
set forth in Section 5.3.2 above.
(iv) Terminating carrier will not assess compensation charges to the ISP FX MOU
in AT&T CONNECTICUT where such traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep
Arrangement.
(v) Originating carrier will apply the appropriate originating access charges only to
the Voice FX MOU in AT&T CONNECTICUT.
6.2.6.4.2 The FX factor may be adjusted by the Parties on a quarterly basis.
6.2.6.5 Either Party may request an audit of the FX Usage Summary or the FX Factor on no fewer
than thirty (30) business day’s written notice and any audit shall be accomplished during
normal business hours at the office of the Party being audited. Such audit must be
performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid for by the Party requesting the audit. Such
audits shall be requested within six months of having received the FX Usage Summary or
the FX Factor and associated usage from the other Party and may not be requested more
than twice per year, once per calendar year, unless the audit finds there has been a 20% or
higher net error or variance in calculations, in which case a subsequent audit is required.
Based upon the audit, previous compensation, billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for
the past six (6) months.
6.2.6.5.1 If the FX factor is adjusted based upon the audit results, the adjusted FX factor
will apply for the six (6) month period following the completion of the audit. If, as
a result of the audit, either Party has overstated the FX factor or underreported
the FX Usage by twenty percent (20%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the
auditing Party for the cost of the audit and will pay for the cost of a subsequent
audit which is to happen within nine (9) months of the initial audit.
6.3 Private Line Services include private line-like and special access services and are not subject to intercarrier
compensation. Private Line Services are defined as a digital point-to-point connection that provides a
dedicated circuit of pre-subscribed bandwidth between any two points. Private Line Services are used to
consolidate communications over one line for voice, data, video and multimedia.
6.4 The Parties recognize and agree that ISP and Internet traffic (excluding ISP-Bound Traffic as defined in
Section 5.1) could also be exchanged outside of the applicable local calling scope, or routed in ways that
could make the rates and rate structure in Sections 4 and 5 above not apply, including but not limited to ISP
calls that fit the underlying Agreement's definitions of:
• FX Traffic
• Optional EAS Traffic
• IntraLATA Toll Traffic
• 800, 888, 877, ("8YY") Traffic
• Feature Group A Traffic
• MCA Traffic
6.5 The Parties agree that, for the purposes of this Appendix, either Party’s End Users remain free to place ISP
calls under any of the above classifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent
such ISP calls are placed, the Parties agree that Sections 4 and 5 above do not apply. The applicable

rates, terms and conditions for: (a) FX Traffic are set forth in Section 6.2; (b) Optional EAS Traffic are set
forth in Section 7; (c) 8YY Traffic are set forth in Section 10; (d) Feature Group A Traffic are set forth in
Section 6.2; (e) IntraLATA Toll Traffic are set forth in Section 12; and/or (f) MCA Traffic are set forth in
Section 8.
7. OPTIONAL CALLING AREA TRAFFIC – AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS AND AT&T TEXAS
7.1 Compensation for Optional Calling Area (OCA) Traffic, (also known as Optional Extended Area Service and
Optional EAS) is for the termination of intercompany traffic to and from the Commission approved one-way
or two-way optional exchanges(s) and the associated metropolitan area, except mandatory extended traffic
as addressed in Sections 4.1 and 5.1 above. The transport and termination rate applies when AT&T
ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS or AT&T TEXAS transports traffic and terminates it at its own switch.
7.2 In the context of this Appendix, Optional Calling Areas (OCAs) exist only in the states of Arkansas, Kansas
and Texas, and are outlined in the applicable state Local Exchange tariffs. This rate is independent of any
retail service arrangement established by either Party. CLEC and AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and
AT&T TEXAS are not precluded from establishing its own local calling areas or prices for purposes of retail
telephone service; however the terminating rates to be used for any such offering will still be administered
as described in this Appendix.
7.3 The state specific OCA Transport and Termination rates are outlined in Appendix Pricing.
8. MCA TRAFFIC -- AT&T MISSOURI
8.1 For compensation purposes in the state of Missouri, Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic shall
be further defined as "Metropolitan Calling Area (MCA) Traffic” and “Non-MCA Traffic.” MCA Traffic is
traffic originated by a party providing a local calling scope plan pursuant to the Missouri Public Service
Commission Orders in Case No. TO-92-306 and Case No. TO-99-483 (MCA Orders) and the call is a
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic based on the calling scope of the originating party pursuant to the MCA Orders.
Non-MCA Traffic is all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that is not defined as MCA Traffic.
8.1.1 Either party providing Metropolitan Calling Area (MCA) service shall offer the full calling scope
prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306, without regard to the identity of the called party’s local service
provider. The parties may offer additional toll-free outbound calling or other services in conjunction
with MCA service, but in any such offering the party shall not identify any calling scope other than
that prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306 as “MCA” service.
8.1.2 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, MCA Traffic
shall be exchanged on a bill-and-keep intercompany compensation basis meaning that the party
originating a call defined as MCA Traffic shall not compensate the terminating party for terminating
the call.
8.2 The parties agree to use the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) to provision the appropriate MCA
NXXs in their networks. The LERG should be updated at least forty-five (45) days in advance of opening a
new code to allow the other party the ability to make the necessary network modifications. If the
Commission orders the parties to use an alternative other than the LERG, the parties will comply with the
Commission’s final order.
8.3 If CLEC provides service via resale or in conjunction with ported numbers in the MCA, the appropriate MCA
NXXs will be updated by AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE.
9. PRIMARY TOLL CARRIER ARRANGEMENTS
9.1 A Primary Toll Carrier (PTC) is a company that provides IntraLATA Toll Traffic Service for its own End User
customers and potentially for a third party ILEC's End User customers. In this ILEC arrangement, the PTC
would receive the ILEC End User IntraLATA toll traffic revenues and pay the ILEC for originating these toll
calls (originating access and billing & collection charges). The PTC would also pay the terminating access
charges on behalf of the ILEC. In those states wherein Primary Toll Carrier arrangements are mandated
Page 251 of 551

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION (ALL TRAFFIC)/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 13 OF 17
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
and AT&T-13STATE is functioning as the PTC for a third party ILEC's End User customers, the following
provisions apply to the IntraLATA toll traffic which is subject to the PTC arrangement:
(i) AT&T-13STATE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from that third party ILEC and
terminated to CLEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state Commission. AT&T-13STATE shall pay the
CLEC on behalf of the originating third party ILEC for the termination of such IntraLATA toll traffic at
the terminating access rates as set forth in the CLEC’s Intrastate Access Service Tariff, but such
compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in the AT&T-13STATE Intrastate Access
Service Tariff in the respective state; and/or
(ii) AT&T-13STATE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from CLEC and terminated to
third party ILEC in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by
the respective state Commission. CLEC shall pay AT&T-13STATE for the use of its facilities at the
rates set forth in AT&T-13STATE’s Intrastate Access Service Tariff. CLEC shall pay the ILEC for the
termination of such traffic originated from CLEC.
10. INTRALATA 800 TRAFFIC
10.1 The Parties shall provide to each other IntraLATA 800 Access Detail Usage Data for Customer billing and
IntraLATA 800 Copy Detail Usage Data for access billing in Exchange Message Interface (EMI) format. On
a monthly basis the Parties agree to provide this data to each other at no charge. In the event of errors,
omissions, or inaccuracies in data received from either Party, the liability of the Party providing such data
shall be limited to the provision of corrected data only. If the originating Party does not send an End User
billable record to the terminating Party, the originating Party will not bill the terminating Party any
interconnection charges for this traffic.
10.2 IntraLATA 800 Traffic calls are billed to and paid for by the called or terminating Party, regardless of which
Party performs the 800 query.
11. MEET POINT BILLING (MPB) AND SWITCHED ACCESS TRAFFIC COMPENSATION
11.1 Intercarrier compensation for Switched Access Traffic shall be on a Meet Point Billing (“MPB”) basis as
described below.
11.2 The Parties will establish MPB arrangements in order to provide Switched Access Services via the
respective carrier’s Tandem Office Switch in accordance with the MPB guidelines contained in the Ordering
and Billing Forum’s MECOD and MECAB documents, as amended from time to time.
11.3 Billing for the Switched Exchange Access Services jointly provided by the Parties via MPB arrangements
shall be according to the multiple bill/single tariff method. As described in the MECAB document, each
Party will render a bill in accordance with its own tariff for that portion of the service it provides. Each Party
will bill its own network access service rates. The residual interconnection charge (RIC), if any, will be
billed by the Party providing the end office function.
11.4 The Parties will maintain provisions in their respective federal and state access tariffs, or provisions within
the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any successor tariff, sufficient to reflect
this MPB arrangement, including MPB percentages.
11.5 As detailed in the MECAB document, the Parties will exchange all information necessary to accurately,
reliably and promptly bill third parties for Switched Access Services traffic jointly handled by the Parties via
the Meet Point Billing arrangement. Information shall be exchanged in a mutually acceptable electronic file
transfer protocol. Where the EMI records cannot be transferred due to a transmission failure, records can
be provided via a mutually acceptable medium. The exchange of Access Usage Records (“AURs”) to
accommodate MPB will be on a reciprocal, no charge basis. Each Party agrees to provide the other Party
with AURs based upon mutually agreed upon intervals.

062907
11.6 MPB shall also apply to all jointly provided Switched Access MOU traffic bearing the 900, or toll free NPAs
(e.g., 800, 877, 866, 888 NPAs, or any other non-geographic NPAs). The Party that performs the SSP
function (launches the query to the 800 database) will bill the 800 Service Provider for this function.
11.7 Each Party will act as the Official Recording Company for switched access usage when it is jointly provided
between the Parties. As described in the MECAB document, the Official Recording Company for tandem
routed traffic is: (1) the end office company for originating traffic, (2) the tandem company for terminating
traffic and (3) the SSP company for originating 800 traffic.
11.8 AT&T-13STATE and CLEC agree to provide the other Party with notification of any discovered errors in the
record exchange process within ten (10) business days of the discovery.
11.9 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60) days
of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable estimate of the lost data,
based upon no more than three (3) to twelve (12) consecutive months of prior usage data.
12. COMPENSATION FOR ORIGINATION AND TERMINATION OF INTERLATA TRAFFIC
12.1 Where a CLEC originates or terminates its own end user InterLATA Traffic not subject to Meet Point Billing,
the CLEC must purchase feature group access service from AT&T-13STATE’s state or federal access
tariffs, whichever is applicable, to carry such InterLATA Traffic.
13. INTRALATA TOLL TRAFFIC COMPENSATION
13.1 For intrastate IntraLATA Message Telephone Service (MTS) toll traffic, compensation for termination of
such traffic will be at terminating access rates. For intrastate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for
termination of such traffic will be at originating access rates, including the Carrier Common Line (CCL)
charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set forth in each Party’s Intrastate Access
Service Tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in an AT&T-
13STATE’s tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
13.2 For interstate IntraLATA MTS toll traffic, compensation for termination of such traffic will be at terminating
access rates. For interstate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for termination of such traffic will be
originating access rates, including the CCL charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set
forth in each Party’s interstate Access Service Tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the
compensation contained in the AT&T-13STATE’s tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
14. BILLING ARRANGEMENTS FOR TERMINATION OF SECTION 251(b)(5) TRAFFIC, ISP-BOUND
TRAFFIC, OPTIONAL EAS TRAFFIC AND INTRALATA TOLL TRAFFIC
14.1 In AT&T-13STATE, each Party, unless otherwise agreed, will calculate terminating interconnection minutes
of use based on standard switch recordings made within the terminating carrier’s network for Section
251(b)(5) Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic. These recordings are
the basis for each Party to generate bills to the other Party.
14.1.1 Where CLEC is using terminating recordings to bill intercarrier compensation, AT&T-12STATE will
provide the terminating Category 11-01-XX records by means of the Daily Usage File (DUF) to
identify traffic that originates from an End User being served by a third party telecommunications
carrier using an AT&T-12STATE non-resale offering whereby AT&T-12STATE provides the end
office switching on a wholesale basis. Such records will contain the Operating Company Number
(OCN) of the responsible LEC that originated the calls which CLEC may use to bill such originating
carrier for MOUS terminated on CLEC's network.
14.2 For those usage based charges where actual charge information is not determinable by AT&T-2STATE
because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the traffic is unidentifiable, the Parties will
jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate charges PLU is
calculated by dividing the Local MOU delivered to a Party for termination by the total MOU delivered to a
Party for termination.

062907
14.2.1 CLEC and AT&T-2STATE agree to exchange such reports and/or data as provided in this
Attachment to facilitate the proper billing of traffic. Either Party may request an audit of such usage
reports on no fewer than thirty (30) business day’s written notice and any audit shall be
accomplished during normal business hours at the office of the Party being audited. Such audit
must be performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid for by the Party requesting the audit. Such
audits shall be requested within six months of having received the usage reports from the other
Party and may not be requested more than twice per year, once per calendar year for each call
detail type unless the audit finds there has been a 20% or higher net error or variance in
calculations, in which case a subsequent audit is required. Based upon the audit, previous
compensation, billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for the past six (6) months. Also, if the PLU
is adjusted based upon the audit results, the adjusted PLU will apply for the six (6) month period
following the completion of the audit. If, as a result of the audit, either Party has overstated the PLU
or underreported the call detail usage by twenty percent (20%) or more, that Party shall reimburse
the auditing Party for the cost of the audit and will pay for the cost of a subsequent audit which is to
happen within nine (9) months of the initial audit.
14.3 In states in which AT&T-13STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound traffic
pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the FCC ISP Compensation
Order, ISP-Bound Traffic will be calculated using the 3:1 Presumption as set forth in Section 5.4 of this
Appendix.
14.4 The measurement of minutes of use over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be in actual
conversation seconds. The total conversation seconds over each individual Local Interconnection Trunk
Group will be totaled for the entire monthly bill and then rounded to the next whole minute.
14.5 All ISP-Bound Traffic for a given usage month shall be due and owing at the same time as payments for
Section 251(b)(5) under this Appendix. The Parties agree that all terms and conditions regarding disputed
minutes of use, nonpayment, partial payment, late payment, interest on outstanding balances, or other
billing and payment terms shall apply to ISP-Bound Traffic the same as for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic under
this Appendix.
14.6 For billing disputes arising from Intercarrier Compensation charges, the party challenging the disputed
amounts (the "Non-Paying Party") may withhold payment for the amounts in dispute (the "Disputed
Amounts") from the party rendering the bill (the "Billing Party") only for so long as the dispute remains
pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and Conditions. Late payment
charges and interest will continue to accrue on the Disputed Amounts while the dispute remains pending.
The Non-Paying Party need not pay late payment charges or interest on the Disputed Amounts for so long
as the dispute remains pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and
Conditions. Upon resolution of the dispute pertaining to the Disputed Amounts in accordance with the
dispute resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions: (1) the Non-Paying Party will remit the
appropriate Disputed Amounts to the Billing Party, together with all related interest and late payment
charges, to the Billing Party within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute, if (and to the
extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party; and/or (2) the Billing Party will render all
appropriate credits and adjustments to the Non-Paying Party for the Disputed Amounts, together with all
appropriate interest and late payment charges, within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the
dispute, if (and to the extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Non-Paying Party.
14.7 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60) days
of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable estimate of the lost data,
based upon no more than three (3) to twelve (12) consecutive months of prior usage data.
15. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND SPECIFIC INTERVENING LAW TERMS
15.1 In the event the pricing scheme in the FCC’s Interim ISP Compensation Order (defined in Section 5 of this
Attachment) is modified, eliminated or replaced, then the Parties agree to negotiate an appropriate
amendment to conform to such change in accordance with the Intervening Law provisions of this
Page 254 of 551

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION (ALL TRAFFIC)/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 16 OF 17
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
Agreement and such new or changed provisions will apply on a prospective basis, beginning with the
effective date of the new order, unless a determination is made as to retroactive application in the decision
rendering such modification, elimination or replacement, in which instance, the new or changed provisions
will apply retroactively as set forth in the new order. Either Party may begin billing the other Party according
to the terms of the new order, beginning sixty (60) days after delivering a request to negotiate the change.
True-up of any retroactive application, for either the amendment negotiation period and/or for the retroactive
application period provided in the order, shall occur within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the
effective date of the order, or be subject to dispute under Section 9 of the General Terms and Conditions of
this Agreement.
16. SWITCHED ACCESS TRAFFIC
16.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates from an
End User physically located in one local exchange and delivered for termination to an End User physically
located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing a common mandatory local
calling area as defined in AT&T-13STATE’s local exchange tariffs on file with the applicable state
commission) including, without limitation, any traffic that (i) terminates over a Party’s circuit switch, including
traffic from a service that originates over a circuit switch and uses Internet Protocol (IP) transport
technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP transport or multiple providers are involved in
providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the End User’s premises in IP format and is transmitted to
the switch of a provider of voice communication applications or services when such switch utilizes IP
technology. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall
be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating Party’s access
tariff(s) and shall be subject to applicable intrastate and interstate switched access charges; provided,
however, the following categories of Switched Access Traffic are not subject to the above stated
requirement relating to routing over feature group access trunks:
(i) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC End User that obtains local dial tone from
CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the IntraLATA toll provider,
(ii) IntraLATA toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an AT&T End User that obtains local dial tone from
AT&T where AT&T is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the IntraLATA toll provider;
(iii) Switched Access Traffic delivered to AT&T from an Interexchange Carrier (IXC) where the terminating
number is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the Local Number Portability (LNP)
query; and/or
(iv) Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a third party competitive local exchange carrier
over interconnection trunk groups carrying Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic (hereinafter
referred to as “Local Interconnection Trunk Groups”) destined to the other Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies, and
arguments relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the Parties prior
to the Effective Date of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the Petition for
Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from Access Charges, WC
Docket No. 01-361(Released April 21, 2004).
16.2 In the limited circumstances in which a third party competitive local exchange carrier delivers Switched
Access Traffic as described in Section 15.1 (iv) above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk
Groups, such Party may deliver such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups. If it is determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups, the terminating Party may object to the delivery of such traffic by providing
written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions and request removal of such traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with
the goal of removing such traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has
not removed or is unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 15.1(iv) above
from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the other party,
the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the applicable Commission

to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such interconnection trunks up to and including
the right to block such traffic and to obtain compensation, if appropriate, from the third party competitive
local exchange carrier delivering such traffic to the extent it is not blocked.
17. ALTERNATE TANDEM PROVIDER
17.1 An Alternate Tandem Provider shall mean a Telecommunications Carrier, with no End Users, that provides
tandem switching services to CLEC with whom it is directly interconnected for the purpose of delivering
Third Party Originating Carrier traffic via direct interconnection arrangements with AT&T-13STATE to (i)
AT&T-13STATE’s End User; (ii) to an End User of a Third Party Terminating Carrier that utilizes local
switching from AT&T-12STATE purchased on a wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users; and/or
(iii) a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s End User.
17.2 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), Incumbent Local
Exchange Carrier (ILEC), Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) provider and/or Out-of Exchange
Local Exchange Carrier (OE-LEC) that sends traffic originated by its End Users to an Alternate Tandem
Provider.
17.3 Third Party Terminating Carrier shall mean Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), Incumbent Local
Exchange Carrier (ILEC), Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) provider, Out-of Exchange Local
Exchange Carrier (OE-LEC), AT&T-13STATE as the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) or a Carrier
that utilizes local switching from AT&T-12STATE purchased on a wholesale basis to provide service to its
End Users, to which traffic is terminated when CLEC uses an Alternate Tandem Provider.
17.4 When Alternate Tandem Provider sends Traffic originated by the End Users of CLEC functioning as the

AT&T-13STATE’s services offered pursuant to the appropriate payphone section(s) of AT&T-
13STATE’s state specific tariff(s) applicable in each state covered by this Appendix are referred to in
this Appendix as “Payphone Lines.” In its Common Carrier Docket No. 96-128, the FCC ordered
AT&T-13STATE to compensate PSP customers of CLECs that resell AT&T-13STATE’s services for
certain calls originated from pay telephones. (Implementation of the Pay Telephone Reclassification

“Payphone Compensation”.

Payphone Compensation is due were made. However, payment may be made later than sixty (60)
calendar days if AT&T-13STATE deems it necessary to investigate a call or calls for possible fraud.
4.4.6 Where the capability exists, AT&T-13STATE will make payment of any Payphone Compensation

issue a check to CLEC if the credit for Payphone Compensation exceeds the balance due to AT&T-
13STATE on the bill. Where the capability to credit CLEC’s bill does not exist, AT&T-13STATE will
make payment by rendering a check.
4.4.7 Nothing in this Appendix entitles CLEC to receive or obligates AT&T-13STATE to provide any call
detail or other call record for any call that gives rise to Payphone Compensation.
4.4.8 CLEC represents and warrants that the only AT&T-13STATE services that CLEC will make available
to PSPs as Payphone Lines are the payphone services that AT&T-13STATE offers pursuant to the
appropriate payphone section(s) of AT&T-13STATE’s state specific tariff(s) applicable in each state
covered by this Appendix.
4.4.9 Except as provided otherwise in this Section 4.4.9, CLEC shall pay the entire amount of the
Payphone Compensation due with respect to each Payphone Line to the PSP that is the CLEC’s
customer for that Payphone Line. CLEC shall make such payment on or before the last business
day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which the call(s) for which
Payphone Compensation is due to the PSP were made. If AT&T-13STATE pays any Payphone
Compensation to CLEC later than sixty (60) calendar days after the close of the calendar quarter
during which the call(s) for which Payphone Compensation is due were made, then CLEC shall pay
the entire amount of such Payphone Compensation to the PSP that is CLEC’s customer for that
Payphone Line within ten (10) calendar days after receiving such Payphone Compensation from
AT&T-13STATE.
4.4.10 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Appendix or in the Agreement to which this
Appendix is attached, CLEC shall indemnify, protect, save harmless and defend AT&T-13STATE
and AT&T-13STATE’s officers, employees, agents, representatives and assigns from and against
any and all losses, costs, liability, damages and expense (including reasonable attorney’s fees)
arising out of any demand, claim, suit or judgment by any Third Party, including a PSP, in any way
relating to or arising from any of the following:
4.4.10.1 CLEC’s failure to comply with all the terms and conditions of this Appendix; or
4.4.10.2 Use by a PSP customer of CLEC of any service other than a Payphone Line to provide pay
telephone service; or

associated state specific retail tariff rates, terms and conditions for suspension of service at the
request of the End User.
4.5.2 AT&T-13STATE will offer CLEC local service provider initiated suspension service for CLEC’s
purposes at the associated AT&T-13STATE state specific retail tariff rate for company initiated
suspension of service. Carrier Disconnect Service is the provider initiated suspension service
available to CLECs in AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE. Service specifics may be obtained in
state specific CLEC Handbooks.
4.5.2.1 CLEC shall be exclusively responsible for placing valid orders for the suspension and the
subsequent disconnection or restoral of service to each of its End Users.
4.5.2.2 Should CLEC suspend service for one of its End Users and fail to submit a subsequent
disconnection order within the maximum number of calendar days permitted for a company
initiated suspension pursuant to the state specific retail tariff, CLEC shall be charged and
shall be responsible for all appropriate monthly service charges for the End User's service
from the suspension date through the disconnection date.

provide interface specifications for electronic access for these functions to CLEC. However, CLEC shall be
responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-13STATE-provided interfaces, as

CALIFORNIA will use electronic mail to provide such information and that such
information will only be available via electronic mail at the present time. It is the
responsibility of CLEC to provide AT&T CALIFORNIA with the correct email
address. Information will be provided on a per-alert basis and will be priced on a
per-alert basis. AT&T CALIFORNIA grants to CLEC a non-exclusive right to use
the information provided by AT&T CALIFORNIA. LEC will not permit anyone
but its duly authorized employees or agents to inspect or use this information.
CLEC agrees to pay AT&T CALIFORNIA a recurring usage rate as set forth in

7. RESPONSIBILITIES OF CLEC
7.1 Prior to submitting an order under this Appendix, CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by
applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as
specified in Section 258(b) of the Act. AT&T-13STATE shall abide by the same applicable laws and
regulations.
7.2 Only an End User can initiate a challenge to a change in its local service provider. If an End User notifies
AT&T-13STATE or CLEC that the End User requests local exchange service, the Party receiving such
request shall be free to provide service to such End User, except in those instances where the End User's
account is local PIC protected. It is the responsibility of the End User to provide authorization in a FCC
approved format to the current provider of record to remove local service provider protection before any
changes in local service provider are processed.
7.2.1 AT&T-13STATE shall be free to connect an End User to any competitive local exchange carrier
based upon that competitive local exchange carrier’s request and that competitive local exchange
carrier’s assurance that proper End User authorization has been obtained. CLEC shall make any
such authorization it has obtained available to AT&T-13STATE upon request and at no charge.
7.2.1.1 The following applies to AT&T MICHIGAN only: The Parties will adhere to the
requirements adopted by the Commission in its Case No. U-11900 with respect to the
selection of primary local exchange carriers and primary interexchange carriers.
7.3 When an End User changes or withdraws authorization, each Party shall release customer-specific facilities
in accordance with the End User’s direction or the direction of the End User's authorized agent. Further,
when an End User abandons its premise, AT&T-13STATE is free to reclaim the facilities for use by another
customer and is free to issue service orders required to reclaim such facilities.
7.4 Neither Party shall be obligated by this Appendix to investigate any allegations of unauthorized changes in
local exchange service (slamming) on behalf of the other Party or a Third Party. If AT&T-13STATE, on
behalf of CLEC, agrees to investigate an alleged incidence of slamming, AT&T-13STATE shall charge
CLEC an investigation fee as set forth in Appendix Pricing in the “OTHER (Resale)” category, listed as
“Slamming Investigation Fee”.
7.5 Should AT&T-13STATE receive an order from CLEC for services under this Appendix, and AT&T-
13STATE is currently providing the same services to another local service provider for the same End User,
CLEC agrees that AT&T-13STATE may notify the local service provider from whom the End User is being
converted of CLEC’s order coincident with or following processing CLEC’s order. It shall then be the
responsibility of the former local service provider of record and CLEC to resolve any issues related to the
End User. This Section 7.5 shall not apply to new or additional lines and services purchased by the End
User from multiple CLECs or from AT&T-13STATE.
7.5.1 If AT&T-13STATE receives an order from another local service provider to convert services for an
End User for whom CLEC is the current local service provider of record, and if CLEC already
subscribes to the Local Disconnect Report (“LDR”), covered in Section 7.5.2, then AT&T-13STATE
shall notify CLEC of such order coincident with or following processing such order. It shall be the
responsibility of CLEC and the other local service provider to resolve any issues related to the End
User. This Section 7.5.1 shall not apply to new or additional lines and services purchased by an End
User from multiple CLECs or from AT&T-13STATE.
7.5.2 On no less than sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice, CLEC may, at its option, subscribe
to the LDR. AT&T-13STATE will furnish the following information via the LDR: the Billing Telephone
Number (“BTN”), Working Telephone Number (“WTN”), and terminal number of all End Users who
have disconnected CLEC’s service. Information furnished electronically will be provided daily on a
per WTN basis and priced on a per WTN basis. CLEC shall pay AT&T-13STATE for the LDR per
WTN plus any applicable transmission charges for the LDR; current WTN prices are as set forth in

PAGE 15 OF 15
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC

agrees that AT&T-13STATE may change the per WTN charge, at AT&T-13STATE's sole discretion,
so long as AT&T-13STATE provides CLEC no less than thirty (30) calendar days notice prior to any
change in the per WTN charge. AT&T-13STATE grants to CLEC a non-exclusive right to use the
LDR information provided by AT&T-13STATE. CLEC will not permit anyone but its duly authorized
employees or agents to inspect or use this information.
7.6 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Appendix,
including but not limited to, calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service
locations; provided, however, CLEC shall not be responsible for payment of charges for any retail services
furnished by AT&T-13STATE directly to End Users and billed by AT&T-13STATE directly to End Users.
7.6.1 Interexchange carried traffic (for example, sent-paid, information services and alternate operator
services messages) received by AT&T-13STATE for billing to resold End User accounts will be
returned as unbillable and will not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned
with those messages to the carrier indicating that the messages originated from a resold account
and will not be billed by AT&T-13STATE.
7.7 AT&T-13STATE shall not be responsible for the manner in which utilization of resold services or the
associated charges are allocated to End Users or others by CLEC. All applicable rates and charges for
services provided to CLEC under this Appendix will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility
of CLEC; provided, however, that CLEC shall not be responsible for payment of charges for any retail
services furnished by AT&T-13STATE directly to End Users and billed by AT&T-13STATE directly to End
Users.
7.7.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Appendix shall be paid by CLEC
regardless of CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
7.8 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for collect, third number billed, toll and
information services (for example, 900) calls, it must order the appropriate blocking for lines provided under
this Appendix and pay any applicable charges. It is the responsibility of CLEC to order the appropriate toll
restriction or blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for
certain types of calls, including 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Express Call Completion.
Depending on the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may
bypass blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any
charges associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that
bypass blocking systems. Charges for Alternatively Billed Calls shall be paid by CLEC at the rated value of
the call less the appropriate State discount.
7.9 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-13STATE-provided
interfaces as described in this Appendix and Appendix OSS.
7.10 CLEC shall be responsible for providing to its End Users and to AT&T-13STATE a telephone number or
numbers that CLEC’s End Users may use to contact CLEC in the event that the End User desires a
repair/service call.
7.10.1 In the event that CLEC’s End Users contact AT&T-13STATE with regard to repair requests, AT&T-
13STATE shall inform such End Users to call CLEC and may provide CLEC’s contact number.
7.11 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that, in the event CLEC makes any “CLEC Change” as that term is
defined in Section 4.10 of the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement to which this Appendix is
attached, CLEC shall comply with the provisions set forth in Section 4.10 of the General Terms and
Conditions of the Agreement to which this Appendix is attached as though set forth herein.
7.12 CLEC will provide forecasts to AT&T-13STATE every January and July using the AT&T-13STATE network
information form, or a format mutually agreed to by the Parties. These written forecasts will be based on
CLEC’s best estimates and will include all resale products CLEC will be ordering within the forecast period.

any, which remain a part of the debtor’s estate notwithstanding an attempted foreclosure or
transfer) and to all duties and obligations of Attaching Party under the Agreement, including
liability to AT&T-13STATE for any act, omission, default, or obligation that arose or occurred

assignee’s or successor’s assumption of any liabilities, or contingent liabilities, of Attaching Party
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.
11.5 Sub-Permits Prohibited. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting Attaching
Party the right to sublease, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any rights under this Agreement or
occupancy permits subject to this Agreement to any third party. Except as otherwise expressly
permitted in this Agreement, Attaching Party shall not allow third party to attach or place facilities to or
in pole or conduit space occupied by or assigned to Attaching Party or to utilize such space.

notice of breach, or waiver or relinquishment of any right to terminate this Agreement.

15. ACCESS TO RIGHTS-OF-WAY
15.1 To the extent AT&T-13STATE has the authority to do so, AT&T-13STATE grants Attaching Party a
right to use any rights-of-way for AT&T-13STATE poles, ducts, or conduits to which Attaching Party
may attach its facilities for the purposes of constructing, operating and maintaining such Attaching
Party’s facilities on AT&T-13STATE’s poles, ducts or conduits. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Attaching Party shall be responsible for determining the necessity of and obtaining from private and/or
public authority any necessary consent, easement, rights-of-way, license, permit, permission,
certification or franchise to construct, operate and/or maintain its facilities on private and public property
at the location of the AT&T-13STATE pole, duct or conduit to which Attaching Party seeks to attach its
facilities. Attaching Party shall furnish proof of any such easement, rights-of-way, license, permit,

13STATE does not warrant the validity or apportionability of any rights it may hold to place facilities on

with the other party’s access to or right to occupy property owned by third-parties which is not subject to

property pursuant to non-exclusive rights-of-way, AT&T-13STATE shall not interfere with Attaching
Party’s negotiations with third-party property owners for similar access or with Attaching Party’s access
to such property pursuant to easements or other rights-of-ways obtained by Attaching Party from the
property owner. At locations where AT&T-13STATE has obtained exclusive rights-of-way from third-
party property owners or otherwise controls the rights-of-way, AT&T-13STATE shall, to the extent
space is available, and subject to reasonable safety, reliability, and engineering conditions, provide
access to Attaching Party on a nondiscriminatory basis, provided that the underlying agreement with
the property owner permits AT&T-13STATE to provide such access, and provided further that AT&T-
13STATE’s charges for such access shall include Attaching Party’s pro rata portion of the charges, if
any, paid by AT&T-13STATE to obtain the rights-of-way, plus any other documented legal,
administrative, and engineering costs incurred by AT&T-13STATE in obtaining the rights-of-way and
processing Attaching Party’s request for access.

is an Authorized Contractor only in those AT&T-13STATE construction districts agreed to by
both parties.
21.2.4 Designation of an Authorized Contractor for a specific category of tasks shall not be deemed
to be the designation of such person or entity as an Authorized Contractor for other purposes,
nor shall approval of an Authorized Contractor by one AT&T-13STATE’s construction district
constitute approval of such Authorized Contractor for the area served by a different AT&T-
13STATE construction district; provided, however, that if a specific construction job extends
beyond the boundaries of a single construction district, an Authorized Contractor shall, for the
purposes of that job, be deemed to have been approved by all AT&T-13STATE construction
districts in which the work is to be performed.
21.3 Construction Schedule. After the issuance of an occupancy permit, Attaching Party shall provide
AT&T-13STATE with a construction schedule and thereafter keep AT&T-13STATE informed of
anticipated changes in the construction schedule.
22. USE AND ROUTINE MAINTENANCE OF ATTACHING PARTY’S FACILITIES
22.1 Routine Maintenance of Attaching Party’s Facilities. Each occupancy permit subject to this Agreement
authorizes Attaching Party to engage in routine maintenance of facilities located on or within AT&T-
13STATE’s poles, ducts, and conduits. Routine maintenance does not include the replacement or
modification of Attaching Party’s facilities in any manner which results in Attaching Party’s facilities
differing substantially in size, weight, or physical characteristics from the facilities described in Attaching
Party’s occupancy permit.
22.2 Short-term Use of Maintenance Ducts for Repair and Maintenance Activities. Maintenance ducts shall
be available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for short-term (not to exceed 30 days) non-emergency
maintenance or repair activities by any entity with facilities in the conduit section in which the
maintenance duct is located; provided, however, that use of the maintenance duct for non-emergency
maintenance and repair activities must be scheduled by AT&T-13STATE. A person or entity using the
maintenance duct for non-emergency maintenance or repair activities shall immediately notify AT&T-
13STATE of such use and must either vacate the maintenance duct within 30 days or, with AT&T-
13STATE’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, rearrange its facilities to ensure
that at least one full-sized replacement maintenance duct (or, if the designated maintenance duct was

an inner duct, a suitable replacement inner duct) is available for use by all occupants in the conduit
section within 30 days after such person or entity occupies the maintenance duct. Cables temporarily
placed in the maintenance duct on a non-emergency basis shall be subject to such accommodations as
may be necessary to rectify emergencies which may occur while the maintenance duct is occupied.
23. MODIFICATION OF ATTACHING PARTY’S FACILITIES
23.1 Notification of Planned Modifications. Attaching Party shall notify AT&T-13STATE in writing at least 30
days before adding to, relocating, replacing or otherwise modifying its facilities already attached to a
AT&T-13STATE Structure. The notice shall contain sufficient information to enable AT&T-13STATE to
determine whether the proposed addition, relocation, replacement, or modification is within the scope of
Attaching Party’s present occupancy permit or requires a new or amended occupancy permit.
23.2 Replacement of Facilities and Overlashing Additional Cables. Attaching Party may replace existing
facilities with new facilities occupying the same AT&T-13STATE Structure, and may overlash additional
cables to its own existing facilities; provided, however, that such activities shall not be considered to be
routine maintenance and shall be subject to the requirements of this article.
24. REQUIRED REARRANGEMENTS OF ATTACHING PARTY’S FACILITIES
24.1 Required Rearrangement of Attaching Party’s Facilities. Attaching Party agrees that Attaching Party
will cooperate with AT&T-13STATE and other users in making rearrangements to AT&T-13STATE
Structure as may be necessary, and that costs incurred by Attaching Party in making such
rearrangements shall, in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, be borne by the parties in
accordance with then applicable law.
24.2 Whenever feasible, AT&T-13STATE shall give Attaching Party not less than 30 days prior written
notice of the need for Attaching Party to rearrange its facilities pursuant to this section. The notice shall
state the date by which such rearrangements are to be completed. Attaching Party shall complete such
rearrangements within the time prescribed in the notice. If Attaching Party does not rearrange facilities
within noted time, AT&T-13STATE will rearrange at Attaching Party’s expense.
25. EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND POLE REPLACEMENTS
25.1 Responsibility for Emergency Repairs; Access to Maintenance Duct. In general, each party shall be
responsible for making emergency repairs to its own facilities and for formulating appropriate plans and
practices enabling such party to make such repairs.
25.1.1 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring either party to perform any
repair or service restoration work of any kind with respect to the other party’s facilities or the
facilities of joint users.
25.1.2 Maintenance ducts shall be available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for emergency repair
activities by any entity with facilities in the conduit section in which the maintenance duct is
located; provided, however, that an entity using the maintenance duct for emergency repair
activities will notify AT&T-13STATE within 12 hours of the current business day (or first business
day following a non-business day) that such entity is entering the AT&T-13STATE conduit
system and using the maintenance duct for emergency restoral purposes. The notice will
include a description of the emergency and non-emergency services involved and an estimate of
the completion time. Maintenance ducts will be used to restore the highest priority services, as
defined in Section 25.3, first. Existing spare ducts may be used for restoration purposes
providing the spare ducts are restored after restoration work is complete. Any spare ducts not
returned will be included be assigned to the user of the duct and an occupancy permit issued.
25.1.3 The Attaching Party shall either vacate the maintenance duct within 30 days or, with AT&T-
13STATE’s consent, rearrange its facilities to ensure that at least one full-sized replacement
maintenance duct (or, if the designated maintenance duct was an inner-duct, a suitable
Page 298 of 551

APPENDIX SA - POLES, CONDUITS AND ROW/AT&T-13STATE

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
replacement inner-duct) is available for use by all occupants in the conduit section within 30 days
after such Attaching Party occupies the maintenance ducts. If Attaching Party fails to vacate the
maintenance duct as described above, AT&T-13STATE may install a maintenance conduit at
the Attaching Party’s expense.
25.2 Designation of Emergency Repair Coordinators and Other Information. For each AT&T-13STATE
construction district, Attaching Party shall provide AT&T-13STATE with the emergency contact number
of Attaching Party’s designated point of contact for coordinating the handling of emergency repairs of
Attaching Party’s facilities and shall thereafter notify AT&T-13STATE of changes to such information.
25.3 Order of Precedence of Work Operations; Access to Maintenance Duct and Other Unoccupied Ducts in
Emergency Situations. When notice and coordination are practicable, AT&T-13STATE, Attaching
Party, and other affected parties shall coordinate repair and other work operations in emergency
situations involving service disruptions. Disputes will be immediately resolved at the site by the affected
parties present in accordance with the following principles.
25.3.1 Emergency service restoration work requirements shall take precedence over other work
operations.
25.3.2 Except as otherwise agreed upon by the parties, restoration of lines for emergency services
providers (e.g., 911, fire, police, national security and hospital lines) shall be given the highest
priority and temporary occupancy of the maintenance duct (and, if necessary, other unoccupied
ducts) shall be assigned in a manner consistent with this priority. Secondary priority shall be
given to restoring services to the local service providers with the greatest numbers of local lines
out of service due to the emergency being rectified. The parties shall exercise good faith in
assigning priorities, shall base their decisions on the best information then available to them at
the site in question, and may, by mutual agreement at the site, take other factors into
consideration in assigning priorities and sequencing service restoration activities.
25.3.3 AT&T-13STATE shall determine the order of precedence of work operations and assignment of
duct space in the maintenance duct (and other unoccupied ducts) only if the affected parties
present are unable to reach prompt agreement; provided, however, that these decisions shall be
made by AT&T-13STATE on a nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the principles set
forth in this section.
25.4 Emergency Pole Replacements.
25.4.1 When emergency pole replacements are required, AT&T-13STATE shall promptly make a good
faith effort to contact Attaching Party to notify Attaching Party of the emergency and to determine
whether Attaching Party will respond to the emergency in a timely manner.
25.4.2 If notified by AT&T-13STATE that an emergency exists which will require the replacement of a
pole, Attaching Party shall transfer its facilities immediately, provided such transfer is necessary
to rectify the emergency. If the transfer is to an AT&T-13STATE replacement pole, the transfer
shall be in accordance with AT&T-13STATE’s placement instructions.
25.4.3 If Attaching Party is unable to respond to the emergency situation immediately, Attaching Party
shall so advise AT&T-13STATE and thereby authorize AT&T-13STATE (or any Other User
sharing the pole with AT&T-13STATE) to perform such emergency-necessitated transfers (and
associated facilities rearrangements) on Attaching Party’s behalf at the Attaching Party’s
expense.
25.5 Expenses Associated with Emergency Repairs. Each party shall bear all reasonable expenses arising
out of or in connection with emergency repairs of its own facilities and transfers or rearrangements of
such facilities associated with emergency pole replacements made in accordance with the provisions of
this article.

provisions of this article.
26. INSPECTION BY AT&T-13STATE OF ATTACHING PARTY’S FACILITIES AND NOTICE OF NON-
COMPLIANCE
26.1 Post-Construction Inspections. AT&T-13STATE will, at the Attaching Party’s expense, conduct a post-
construction inspection of the Attaching Party’s attachment of facilities to AT&T-13STATE’s Structures
for the purpose of determining the conformance of the attachments to the occupancy permit. AT&T-
13STATE will provide the Attaching Party advance written notice of proposed date and time of the post-
construction inspection. The Attaching Party may accompany AT&T-13STATE on the post-
construction inspection.
26.2 Right to Make Periodic or Spot Inspections. AT&T-13STATE shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to make Periodic or Spot Inspections of all facilities attached to AT&T-13STATE’s Structure.
Periodic Inspections will not be made more often than once every 2 years unless in AT&T-13STATE’s
judgement such inspections are required for reasons involving safety or because of an alleged violation
of the terms of this Agreement.
26.3 If Attaching Party’s facilities are in compliance with this Agreement, there will be no charges incurred by
the Attaching Party for the periodic or spot inspection. If Attaching Party’s facilities are not in
compliance with this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE may charge Attaching Party for the inspection. The
costs of Periodic Inspections will be paid by those Attaching Parties with 2% or greater of their
attachments in violation. The amount paid by the Attaching Party shall be the percentage that their
violations bear to the total violations of all Attaching Parties found during the inspection.
26.4 If the inspection reflects that Attaching Party’s facilities are not in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, Attaching Party shall bring its facilities into compliance within 30 days after being notified of
such noncompliance. If any make ready or modification work to AT&T-13STATE’s Structures is
required to bring Attaching Party’s facilities into compliance, the Attaching Party shall provide notice to
AT&T-13STATE and the make ready work or modification will be treated in the same fashion as make
ready work or modifications for a new request for attachment. If the violation creates a hazardous
condition, facilities must be brought into compliance upon notification.
26.5 Notice of Noncompliance. If, at any time, AT&T-13STATE determines that Attaching Party’s facilities or
any part thereof have not been placed or maintained or are not being used in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE may send written notice to Attaching Party specifying
the alleged noncompliance. Attaching Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of the notice as soon as
practicable. If Attaching Party does not dispute AT&T-13STATE’s assertion that such facilities are not
in compliance, Attaching Party agrees to provide AT&T-13STATE with a schedule for bringing such
facilities into compliance, to bring the facilities into compliance within a reasonable time, and to notify
AT&T-13STATE in writing when the facilities have been brought into compliance.
26.6 Disputes over Alleged Noncompliance. If Attaching Party disputes AT&T-13STATE’s assertion that
Attaching Party’s facilities are not in compliance, Attaching Party shall notify AT&T-13STATE in writing
of the basis for Attaching Party’s assertion that its facilities are in compliance.
26.7 Failure to Bring Facilities into Compliance. If Attaching Party has not brought the facilities into
compliance within a reasonable time or provided AT&T-13STATE with proof sufficient to persuade
AT&T-13STATE that AT&T-13STATE erred in asserting that the facilities were not in compliance, and
if AT&T-13STATE determines in good faith that the alleged noncompliance causes or is likely to cause
material damage to AT&T-13STATE’s facilities or those of other users, AT&T-13STATE may, at its
Page 300 of 551

option and Attaching Party’s expense, take such non-service affecting steps as may be required to
bring Attaching Party’s facilities into compliance, including but not limited to correcting any conditions
which do not meet the specifications of this Agreement.
26.8 Correction of Conditions by AT&T-13STATE. If AT&T-13STATE elects to bring Attaching Party’s
facilities into compliance, the provisions of this Section shall apply.

26.9 Attaching Party to Bear Expenses. Attaching Party shall bear all expenses arising out of or in
connection with any work performed to bring Attaching Party’s facilities into compliance with this
Section; provided, however that nothing contained in this Section or any license issued hereunder shall

laws or regulations, must be borne by persons or entities other than Attaching Party.
27. TAGGING OF FACILITIES AND UNAUTHORIZED ATTACHMENTS
27.1 Facilities to Be Marked. Attaching Party shall tag or otherwise mark all of Attaching Party’s facilities
placed on or in AT&T-13STATE’s Structure in a manner sufficient to identify the facilities as those
belonging to the Attaching Party.
27.2 Removal of Untagged Facilities. AT&T-13STATE may, without notice to any person or entity, remove
from AT&T-13STATE’s poles or any part of AT&T-13STATE’s conduit system the Attaching Party’s
facilities, if AT&T-13STATE determines that such facilities are not the subject of a current occupancy
permit and are not otherwise lawfully present on AT&T-13STATE’s poles or in AT&T-13STATE’s
conduit system.
27.3 Notice to Attaching Party. If any of Attaching Party’s facilities for which no occupancy permit is
presently in effect are found attached to AT&T-13STATE’s poles or anchors or within any part of
AT&T-13STATE’s conduit system, AT&T-13STATE, without prejudice to other rights or remedies
available to AT&T-13STATE under this Agreement, and without prejudice to any rights or remedies
which may exist independent of this Agreement, shall send a written notice to Attaching Party advising
Attaching Party that no occupancy permit is presently in effect with respect to the facilities and that
Attaching Party must, within 30 days, respond to the notice as provided in Section 27.6 of this
Agreement.
27.4 Attaching Party’s Response. Within 60 days after receiving a notice under Section 27.5 of this
Agreement, Attaching Party shall acknowledge receipt of the notice and submit to AT&T-13STATE, in
writing, an application for a new or amended occupancy permit with respect to such facilities.
27.5 Approval of Request and Retroactive Charges. If AT&T-13STATE approves Attaching Party’s
application for a new or amended occupancy permit, Attaching Party shall be liable to AT&T-13STATE
for all fees and charges associated with the unauthorized attachments as specified in Section 27.10 of
this Agreement. The issuance of a new or amended occupancy permit as provided by this article shall

PAGE 22 OF 24
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
not operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-13STATE of any of its rights or privileges
under this Agreement or otherwise.
27.6 Attachment and occupancy fees and charges shall continue to accrue until the unauthorized facilities
are removed from AT&T-13STATE’s poles, conduit system or rights of way or until a new or amended
occupancy permit is issued and shall include, but not be limited to, all fees and charges which would
have been due and payable if Attaching Party and its predecessors had continuously complied with all
applicable AT&T-13STATE licensing requirements. Such fees and charges shall be due and payable
30 days after the date of the bill or invoice stating such fees and charges. In addition, the Attaching
Party shall be liable for an unauthorized attachment and/or occupancy fee as specified in Section 29 of
this Agreement. Payment of such fees shall be deemed liquidated damages and not a penalty. In
addition, Attaching Party shall rearrange or remove its unauthorized facilities at AT&T-13STATE’s
request to comply with applicable placement standards, shall remove its facilities from any space
occupied by or assigned to AT&T-13STATE or another Other User, and shall pay AT&T-13STATE for
all costs incurred by AT&T-13STATE in connection with any rearrangements, modifications, or
replacements necessitated as a result of the presence of Attaching Party’s unauthorized facilities.
27.7 Removal of Unauthorized Attachments. If Attaching Party does not obtain a new or amended
occupancy permit with respect to unauthorized facilities within the specified period of time, AT&T-
13STATE shall by written notice advise Attaching Party to remove its unauthorized facilities not less
than 60 days from the date of notice and Attaching Party shall remove the facilities within the time
specified in the notice. If the facilities have not been removed within the time specified in the notice,
AT&T-13STATE may, at AT&T-13STATE’s option, remove Attaching Party’s facilities at Attaching
Party’s expense.
27.8 No Ratification of Unpermited Attachments or Unauthorized Use of AT&T-13STATE’s Facilities. No act
or failure to act by AT&T-13STATE with regard to any unauthorized attachment or occupancy or
unauthorized use of AT&T-13STATE’s Structure shall be deemed to constitute a ratification by AT&T-
13STATE of the unauthorized attachment or occupancy or use, nor shall the payment by Attaching
Party of fees and charges for unauthorized pole attachments or conduit occupancy exonerate Attaching
Party from liability for any trespass or other illegal or wrongful conduct in connection with the placement
or use of such unauthorized facilities.
28. REMOVAL OF ATTACHING PARTY’S FACILITIES
28.1 When Applicant no longer intends to occupy space on an AT&T-13STATE pole or in a AT&T-13STATE
duct or conduit, Applicant will provide written notification to AT&T-13STATE that it wishes to terminate
the occupancy permit with respect to such space and will remove its facilities from the space described
in the notice. Upon removal of Applicant’s facilities, the occupancy permit shall terminate and the
space shall be available for reassignment.
28.1.1 Attaching Party shall be responsible for and shall bear all expenses arising out of or in
connection with the removal of its facilities from AT&T-13STATE’s Structure.
28.1.2 Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the parties, Applicant must, after removing its
facilities, plug all previously occupied ducts at the entrances to AT&T-13STATE’s manholes.
28.1.3 Applicant shall be solely responsible for the removal of its own facilities from AT&T-13STATE’s
Structure.
28.2 At AT&T-13STATE’s request, Attaching Party shall remove from AT&T-13STATE’s Structure any of
Attaching Party’s facilities which are no longer in active use. Upon request, the Attaching Party will
provide proof satisfactory to AT&T-13STATE that an Attaching Party’s facility is in active service.
Attaching Party shall not abandon any of its facilities by leaving such facilities on or in AT&T-
13STATE’s Structure.

062907
28.3 Removal Following Termination of Occupancy Permit. Attaching Party shall remove its facilities from
AT&T-13STATE’s poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way within 30 days after termination of the
occupancy permit.
28.4 Removal Following Replacement of Facilities. Attaching Party shall remove facilities no longer in
service from AT&T-13STATE’s Structures within 30 days after the date Attaching Party replaces
existing facilities on a pole or in a conduit with substitute facilities on the same pole or in the same
conduit.
28.5 Removal to Avoid Forfeiture. If the presence of Attaching Party’s facilities on or in AT&T-13STATE’s
Structure would cause a forfeiture of the rights of AT&T-13STATE to occupy the property where such
Structure is located, AT&T-13STATE will promptly notify Attaching Party in writing and Attaching Party
shall not, without due cause and justification, refuse to remove its facilities within such time as may be
required to prevent such forfeiture. AT&T-13STATE will give Attaching Party not less than 30 days
from the date of notice to remove Attaching Party’s facilities unless prior removal is required to prevent
the forfeiture of AT&T-13STATE’s rights. At Attaching Party’s request, the parties will engage in good
faith negotiations with each other, with Other Users, and with third-party property owners and
cooperatively take such other steps as may be necessary to avoid the unnecessary removal of
Attaching Party’s facilities.
28.6 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-13STATE; Notice of Intent to Remove. If Attaching Party fails to remove
its facilities from AT&T-13STATE’s Structure in accordance with the provisions of Sections 28.1-28.6 of
this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE may remove such facilities and store them at Attaching Party’s
expense in a public warehouse or elsewhere without being deemed guilty of trespass or conversion and
without becoming liable to Attaching Party for any injury, loss, or damage resulting from such actions.
AT&T-13STATE shall give Attaching Party not less than 30 days prior written notice of its intent to
remove Attaching Party’s facilities pursuant to this section.
28.7 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-13STATE. If AT&T-13STATE removes any of Attaching Party’s
facilities pursuant to this article, Attaching Party shall reimburse AT&T-13STATE for AT&T-13STATE’s
costs in connection with the removal, storage, delivery, or other disposition of the removed facilities.
29. RATES, FEES, CHARGES, AND BILLING
29.1 Rates, Charges and Fees Subject to Applicable Laws, Regulations, Rules, and Commission Orders. All
rates, charges and fees outlined in this Agreement will be set forth in Exhibit I of this Appendix. All
rates, charges and fees shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and
commission orders.
29.2 Changes to Rates, Charges and Fees. Subject to applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations
and orders, AT&T-13STATE shall have the right to change the rates, charges and fees outlined in this
Agreement. AT&T-13STATE will provide the Attaching Party 60 days written notice, advising the
Attaching Party of the specific changes being made and the effective date of the change. If the
changes outlined in the notice are not acceptable to the Attaching Party, Attaching Party may either (1)
seek renegotiation of this Agreement, (2) terminate this Agreement, or (3) seek relief through the
dispute resolution process in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
30. PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS
30.1 Bond May Be Required. AT&T-13STATE may require Attaching Party, Authorized Contractors, and
other persons acting on Attaching Party’s behalf to execute performance and payment bonds (or
provide other forms of security) in amounts and on terms sufficient to guarantee the performance of the
Attaching Party’s obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.
30.1.1 If a bond or similar form of assurance is required of Attaching Party, an Authorized Contractor, or
other person acting on Attaching Party’s behalf, Attaching Party shall promptly submit to AT&T-
13STATE adequate proof that the bond remains in full force and effect and provide certification

from the company issuing the bond that the bond will not be cancelled, changed or materially
altered without first providing AT&T-13STATE 60 days written notice.
30.2 Payment and Performance Bonds in Favor of Contractors and Subcontractors. Attaching Party shall be
responsible for paying all employees, contractors, subcontractors, mechanics, materialmen and other
persons or entities performing work or providing materials in connection with Attaching Party’s
performance under this Agreement. In the event any lien, claim or demand is made on AT&T-
13STATE by any such employee, contractor, subcontractor, mechanic, materialman, or other person or
entity providing such materials or performing such work, AT&T-13STATE may require, in addition to
any security provided under Section 30.1 of this Agreement, that Attaching Party execute payment or
performance bonds, or provide such other security, as AT&T-13STATE may deem reasonable or
necessary to protect AT&T-13STATE from any such lien, claim or demand.

2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
2.1 Lawful UNEs and Declassification. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which
AT&T-13STATE will provide CLEC with access to unbundled network elements under Section 251(c)(3) of
the Act in AT&T-13STATE's incumbent local exchange areas for the provision of Telecommunications
Services by CLEC; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, AT&T-
13STATE shall be obligated to provide UNEs only to the extent required by Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, as
determined by lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC and judicial orders,
and may decline to provide UNEs to the extent that provision of the UNE(s) is not required by Section
251(c)(3) of the Act, as determined by lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective
FCC and judicial orders. UNEs that AT&T-13STATE is required to provide pursuant to Section 251(c)(3)
of the Act, as determined by lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC and
judicial orders shall be referred to in this Agreement as “Lawful UNEs.”

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
2.1.1 A network element, including a network element referred to as a Lawful UNE under this Agreement,
will cease to be a Lawful UNE under this Agreement if it is no longer required by Section 251(c)(3) of
the Act, as determined by lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC
and judicial orders. Without limitation, a Lawful UNE that has ceased to be a Lawful UNE may also
be referred to as “Declassified.”
2.1.2 Without limitation, a network element, including a network element referred to as a Lawful UNE
under this Agreement is Declassified upon or by (a) the issuance of a legally effective finding by a
court or regulatory agency acting within its lawful authority that requesting Telecommunications
Carriers are not impaired without access to a particular network element on an unbundled basis; or
(b) the issuance of any valid law, order or rule by the Congress, FCC or a judicial body stating that
an incumbent LEC is not required, or is no longer required, to provide a network element on an
unbundled basis pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Act; or (c) the absence, by vacatur or
otherwise, of a legally effective FCC rule requiring the provision of the network element on an
unbundled basis under Section 251(c)(3). By way of example only, a network element can cease to
be a Lawful UNE or be Declassified generally, or on an element-specific, route-specific or
geographically-specific basis or on a class of elements basis. Under any scenario, Section 2.5
“Transition Procedure” shall apply.
2.1.3 It is the Parties’ intent that only Lawful UNEs shall be available under this Agreement; accordingly, if
this Agreement requires or appears to require Lawful UNE(s) or unbundling without specifically
noting that the UNE(s) or unbundling must be “Lawful,” the reference shall be deemed to be a
reference to Lawful UNE(s) or Lawful unbundling, as defined in this Section 2.1. If an element is not
required to be provided under this Appendix Lawful UNE and/or not described in this Appendix
Lawful UNE, it is the Parties’ intent that the element is not available under this Agreement,
notwithstanding any reference to the element elsewhere in the Agreement, including in any other
Appendix, Schedule or in the Pricing Appendix.
2.1.4 By way of example only, if terms and conditions of this Agreement state that AT&T-13STATE is
required to provide a Lawful UNE or Lawful UNE combination, and that Lawful UNE or the involved
Lawful UNE (if a combination) is Declassified or otherwise no longer constitutes a Lawful UNE, then
AT&T-13STATE shall not be obligated to provide the item under this Agreement as an unbundled
network element, whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement under
the Agreement.
2.2 Nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute consent by AT&T-13STATE that any
item identified in this Agreement as a UNE, network element or Lawful UNE is a network element or UNE
under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, as determined by lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful
and effective FCC and judicial orders, that AT&T-13STATE is required to provide to CLEC alone, or in
combination with other network elements or UNEs (Lawful or otherwise), or commingled with other network
elements, UNEs (Lawful or otherwise) or other services or facilities.
2.3 The preceding includes without limitation that AT&T-13STATE shall not be obligated to provide
combinations (whether considered new, pre-existing or existing) or other arrangements (including, where
applicable, Commingled Arrangements) involving AT&T-13STATE network elements that do not constitute
Lawful UNEs, or where Lawful UNEs are not requested for permissible purposes.
2.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Amendment to this Agreement, including but
not limited to intervening law, change in law or other substantively similar provision in the Agreement or any
Amendment, if an element described as an unbundled network element or Lawful UNE in this Agreement is
Declassified or is otherwise no longer a Lawful UNE, then the Transition Procedure defined in Section 2.5,
below, shall govern.
2.5 Non-Impaired Wire Center Criteria and Related Processes
2.5.1 AT&T-13STATE has designated and posted to CLEC Online the wire centers where it contends the
thresholds for DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity Loops as defined pursuant to Rule
Page 309 of 551

APPENDIX LAWFUL UNES (Post-TRRO)/AT&T-13STATE

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
51.319(a)(4) and Rule 51.319(a)(5) and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Non-Impaired Wire Centers as defined
pursuant to Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii) have been met. AT&T-13STATE’s
designations shall be treated as controlling (even if CLEC believes the list is inaccurate) for
purposes of transition and ordering unless CLEC provides a self-certification as outlined below. Until
CLEC provides a self-certification for High-Capacity Loops and/or Transport for such wire center
designations, CLEC will not submit High Capacity Loop and/or Transport orders based on the wire
center designation, and if no self-certification is provided will transition its Embedded Base of DS1
and DS3 Loop and Transport arrangements affected by the designation by disconnecting or
transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, by March 11, 2006. CLEC will
transition any affected Dark Fiber Transport arrangements affected by the wire center designations
by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, by September
11, 2006. AT&T-13STATE will update the CLEC Online posted list and will advise CLECs of such
posting via Accessible Letter, which term for the purposes of this Section 2.5 of this Agreement shall
be deemed to mean an Accessible Letter issued after the effective date of this Agreement, as set
forth in this Section 2.5 of this Agreement.
2.5.2 If the Commission has not previously determined, in any proceeding, that a wire center is properly
designated as a wire center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), then, prior to submitting an order for an
unbundled a DS1/DS3 High-Capacity Loop, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated
Transport arrangement, CLEC shall perform a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine that, to the
best of CLEC’s knowledge, whether the wire center meets the non-impairment thresholds as set
forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule 51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii).
If, based on its reasonably diligent inquiry, the CLEC disputes the AT&T-13STATE wire center non-
impairment designation, the CLEC will provide a self-certification to AT&T-13STATE identifying the
wire center(s) for which it is self-certifying. In performing its inquiry, CLEC shall not be required to
consider any lists of non-impaired Wire Centers compiled by AT&T-13STATE as creating a
presumption that a Wire Center is not impaired. CLEC can send a letter to AT&T-13STATE claiming
Self Certification or CLEC may elect to self-certify using a written or electronic notification sent to
AT&T-13STATE. If CLEC makes such a self-certification, and CLEC is otherwise entitled to the
ordered element under the Agreement, AT&T-13STATE shall provision the requested facilities in
accordance with CLEC’s order and within AT&T-13STATE’s standard ordering interval applicable to
such facilities. If AT&T-13STATE in error rejects CLEC orders, where CLEC has provided self
certification in accordance with this Section 2.5 of this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE will modify its
systems to accept such orders within 5 business hours of CLEC notification to its account manager.
CLEC may not submit a self-certification for a wire center after the transition period for the DS1/DS3
Loops and/or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport impacted by the
designation of the wire center has passed.
2.5.3 The parties recognize that wire centers that AT&T-13STATE had not designated as meeting the
FCC’s non-impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005, may meet those thresholds in the future. In
the event that a wire center that is not currently designated as meeting one or more of the FCC’s
non-impairment thresholds, meets one or more of these thresholds at a later date, AT&T-13STATE
may add the wire center to the list of designated wire centers and the Parties will use the following
process:
2.5.3.1 AT&T-13STATE may update the wire center list as changes occur.
2.5.3.2 To designate a wire center that had previously not met one or more of the FCC’s
impairment thresholds but subsequently does so, AT&T-13STATE will provide notification
to CLEC via Accessible Letter and by a posting on CLEC Online.
2.5.3.3 AT&T-13STATE will continue to accept CLEC orders for impacted DS1/DS3 High Capacity
Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport without
requiring CLEC self-certification for 30 calendar days after the date the Accessible Letter is
issued.

2.5.3.4 In the event the CLEC disagrees with AT&T-13STATE’s determination and CLEC has 60
calendar days from the issuance of the Accessible Letter to dispute AT&T-13STATE’s
determination regarding the wire center by providing a self-certification to AT&T-13STATE.
2.5.3.5 If the CLEC does not use the self-certification process described in this Section 2.5 of this
Agreement to self-certify against AT&T-13STATE’s wire center designation within 60
calendar days of the issuance of the Accessible Letter, the parties must comply with the
Applicable Transitional Period as follows: transition all circuits that have been declassified
by the wire center designation(s) within 30 days ending on the 90th day after the issuance
of the Accessible Letter providing the wire center designation of non-impairment or the end
of the applicable transition period described in Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement, whichever
is later For the Applicable Transitional Period, no additional notification will be required.
CLEC may not obtain new DS1/DS3 High Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport
and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport in wire centers and/or routes where such circuits
have been declassified during the applicable transition period.
2.5.3.6 If the CLEC does provide self-certification to dispute AT&T-13STATE’s designation
determination within 60 calendar days of the issuance of the Accessible Letter, AT&T-
13STATE may dispute CLEC’s self-certification as described in Sections 2.5.5 and 2.5.6 of
this Agreement and AT&T-13STATE will accept and provision the applicable loop and
transport orders for the CLEC providing the self certification during a dispute resolution
process.
2.5.3.7 During the applicable transition period, the rates paid will be the rates in effect at the time
of the non-impairment designations plus 15%.
2.5.4 If the Commission has previously determined, in any proceeding, that a wire center is properly
designated as a wire center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), then CLEC shall not request DS1/DS3
High-Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport
arrangements declassified by the non-impairment status of the wire center in such wire center. If a
CLEC withdraws its self-certification after a dispute has been filed with the Commission, but before
the Commission has made a determination regarding the wire center designation, the wire center
designation(s) that were the subject of the dispute will be treated as though the Commission
approved AT&T-13STATE’s designations.
2.5.5 If it desires to do so, AT&T-13STATE can dispute the self-certification and associated CLEC orders
for facilities pursuant to the following procedures: AT&T-13STATE will notify the CLEC of its intent
to dispute the CLEC’s self-certification within 30 days of the CLEC’s self-certification or within 30
days of the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. AT&T-13STATE will file the dispute
for resolution with the state Commission within 60 days of the CLEC’s self-certification or within 60
days of the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. AT&T-13STATE will notify CLECs
of the filing of such a dispute via Accessible Letter. If the self-certification dispute is filed with the
state Commission for resolution, the Parties will not oppose requests for intervention by other
CLECs if such request is related to the disputed wire center designation(s). The parties agree to
urge the state Commission to adopt a case schedule resulting in the prompt resolution of the
dispute. AT&T-13STATE’s failure to file a timely challenge, i.e., within 60 days of the CLEC’s self-
certification or within 60 days of the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, to any
CLEC’s self certification for a given wire center shall be deemed a waiver by AT&T-13STATE of its
rights to challenge any subsequent self certification for the affected wire center except as provided
below. AT&T-13STATE shall promptly notify CLEC of any time where AT&T-13STATE has waived
its ability to challenge a self-certification as to any wire center for carrier. AT&T-13STATE may
challenge future CLEC self-certifications pertaining to the wire center if the underlying facts
pertaining to the designation of non-impairment have changed, in which case the Parties will follow
the provisions for updating the wire center list outlined in Section 2.5.3 of this Agreement. During

the timeframe of any dispute resolution proceeding, AT&T-13STATE shall continue to provide the
High-Capacity Loop or Transport facility in question to CLEC at the rates in the Pricing Appendix to
the Agreement. If the CLEC withdraws its self-certification, or if the state Commission determines
through arbitration or otherwise that CLEC was not entitled to the provisioned DS1/DS3 Loops or
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport under Section 251, the rates paid
by CLEC for the affected loop or transport shall be subject to true-up as follows:
2.5.5.1 For wire centers designated by AT&T-13STATE prior to March 11, 2005 and
2.5.5.1.1 For the affected loop/transport element(s) installed prior to March 11, 2005,
2.5.5.1.1.1 CLEC will provide a true-up calculated using a beginning date of
March 11, 2005 based on the FCC transitional rate described in
Section 2.5.3.7 of this Appendix or if applicable, Section 1.2 of
the Embedded Base Rider to this Agreement between March 11,
2005 and the end of the initial TRRO transition period described in
Section 2.5.1. If affected loops/transport element(s) remain in place
after the end of the initial TRRO transition period, CLEC will also
provide a true-up for the period after the end of initial TRRO
transition period calculated using the equivalent special access
rates during the period between the end of the initial transition
period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no
equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined
using the transitional rate described in Section 2.5.3.7 of this
Appendix or if applicable, Section 1.2 of the Embedded Base
Rider of this Agreement. The applicable equivalent special access
rate/transitional rate as described above will continue to apply until
the facility has been transitioned.
2.5.5.1.2 For the affected loop/transport element(s) installed after March 11, 2005, CLEC
will provide a true-up to an equivalent special access rate as of the later of the
date billing began for the provisioned element or thirty days after AT&T-
13STATE’s notice of non-impairment. If no equivalent special access rate
exists, a true-up will be determined using the transitional rate described in
Section 2.5.3.7 of this Appendix or if applicable, Section 1.2 of the
Embedded Base Rider of this Agreement. The applicable equivalent special
access rate/transitional rate will continue to apply until the facility has been
transitioned.
2.5.5.2 For wire centers designated by AT&T-13STATE after March 11, 2005,
2.5.5.2.1 For affected loop/transport elements ordered before AT&T-13STATE’s wire
center designation,
2.5.5.2.1.1 if the applicable transition period is within the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement, CLEC will
provide a true-up during the period between the date that is thirty
(30) days after AT&T-13STATE’s notice of non-impairment and the
date the circuit is transitioned to the transitional rate described in
Section 2.5.3.7 of this Agreement.
2.5.5.2.1.2 if the applicable transition period is after the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement has expired,
CLEC will provide a true-up based on the transitional rate described
in Section 2.5.3.7 of this Agreement between the date that is thirty
(30) days after AT&T-13STATE’s notice of non-impairment and the
end of the applicable transition period described in Section 2.5.1

and the equivalent special access rates during the period between
the end of the initial transition period and the date the circuit is
actually transitioned. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a
true-up will be determined using the transitional rate described in
Section 2.5.3.7 of this Agreement. The applicable equivalent
special access/transitional rate as described above will continue to
apply until the facility has been transitioned.
2.5.5.2.2 For affected loop/transport elements ordered after AT&T-13STATE’s wire center
designation, CLEC will provide a true-up for the affected loop/transport element(s) to an
equivalent special access rate for the affected loop/transport element(s) as of the later of
the date billing began for the provisioned element or thirty (30) days after AT&T-
13STATE’s notice of non-impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up
will be determined using the transitional rate described in Section 2.5.3.7 of this
Agreement. The applicable equivalent special access/transitional rate will continue to
apply until the facility has been transitioned.
2.5.6 In the event of a dispute following CLEC’s Self-Certification, upon request by the Commission or
CLEC, AT&T-13STATE will make available, subject to the appropriate state or federal protective
order, and other reasonable safeguards, all documentation and all data upon which AT&T-13STATE
intends to rely, which will include the detailed business line information for the AT&T-13STATE wire
center or centers that are the subject of the dispute.
2.5.7 The provisions of Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement shall apply to the transition of DS1/DS3 High-
Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
impacted by wire center designation(s). As outlined in Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement, requested
transitions of DS1/DS3 High Capacity loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated
Transport arrangements shall be performed in a manner that reasonably minimizes the disruption or
degradation to CLEC’s customer’s service, and all applicable charges shall apply. Cross-connects
provided by AT&T-13STATE in conjunction with such Loops and/or Transport shall be billed at
applicable wholesale rates (e.g., prior to transition, cross connects will be billed at transitional rates,
after transition, if conversion is to an access product, cross connects will be billed at applicable
access rates). Cross-connects that are not associated with such transitioned DS1/DS3 High-
Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
shall not be re-priced.
2.5.8 AT&T-13STATE will process CLEC orders for DS1/DS3 High Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated
Transport, or Dark Fiber Transport conversion or disconnection. AT&T-13STATE will not convert or
disconnect these services prior to the end of the applicable transitional period unless specifically
requested by the CLEC; however, CLEC is responsible for ensuring that it submits timely orders in
order to complete the transition by the end of applicable transitional period in an orderly manner.
2.5.9 A building that is served by both an impaired wire center and a non impaired wire center and that is
not located in the serving area for the non-impaired wire center will continue to have Affected
Elements available from the impaired wire center and support incremental moves, adds, and
changes otherwise permitted by the Agreement, as amended.
2.5.10 CLEC may not self-certify that it is entitled to obtain DS1/DS3 Loops or DS1/DS3 Dedicated
Transport at a location where CLEC has met the volume cap set forth in Sections 8.3.4.4.1 and
8.3.5.4.1 (for DS1/DS3 Loops) and 13.3.5.1 and 13.3.6.1 (for DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport).
2.5.11 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to this
Agreement, at the end of the Applicable Transitional Period, unless CLEC has submitted a
disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as applicable, under Section 2.5.1 of this Agreement, and if
CLEC and AT&T-13STATE have failed to reach agreement under Section 2.5.8 of this Agreement
as to a substitute service arrangement or element, then AT&T-13STATE may, at its sole option,
disconnect dark fiber element(s), whether previously provided alone or in combination with or as part

of any other arrangement, or convert the subject element(s), whether alone or in combination with or
as part of any other arrangement to an analogous resale or access service, if available at rates
applicable to such analogous service or arrangement.
2.6 AT&T-13STATE will provide access to Lawful UNEs for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications
Service. (Act, Section 251(c)(3).
2.7 AT&T-13STATE will provide CLEC nondiscriminatory access to Lawful UNEs (Act, Section 251(c)(3), Act,
47 CFR § 51.307(a)):
2.7.1 At any technically feasible point (Act, Section 251(c)(3); 47 CFR § 51.307(a));
2.7.2 At the rates, terms, and conditions which are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (Act, Section
251(c)(3); 47 CFR § 51.307(a));
2.7.3 In a manner that allows CLEC to provide a Telecommunications Service that may be offered by
means of that Lawful UNE (Act, Section 251(c)(3); 47 CFR § 51.307 (c));
2.7.4 In a manner that allows access to the facility or functionality of a requested Lawful UNE to be
provided separately from access to other elements, and for a separate charge (47 CFR § 51.307(d));
2.7.5 With technical information regarding AT&T-13STATE's network facilities to enable CLEC to achieve
access to Lawful UNEs (47 CFR § 51.307(e));
2.7.6 Except as provided in this Appendix, without imposing limitations, restrictions, or requirements on
requests for, or the use of, Lawful UNEs for the service CLEC seeks to offer (47 CFR § 51.309(a));
2.7.7 Where applicable, terms and conditions of access to Lawful UNEs shall be no less favorable than
terms and conditions under which AT&T-13STATE provides such elements to itself (47 CFR §
51.313(b));
2.7.8 Only to the extent it has been determined that these elements are required by the “necessary” and
“impair” standards of the Act (Act, Section 251(d)(2));
2.7.9 Except upon request of CLEC, AT&T-13STATE shall not separate CLEC-requested Lawful UNEs
that are currently combined. (47 CFR § 51.315(b)) AT&T-13STATE is not prohibited from or
otherwise limited in separating any Lawful UNEs not requested by CLEC or a Telecommunications
Carrier, including without limitation in order to provide a Lawful UNE(s) or other AT&T-13STATE
offering(s).
2.8 As provided for herein, AT&T-13STATE will permit CLEC exclusive use of a Lawful UNE facility for a period
of time, and when CLEC is purchasing access to a feature, function, or capability of such a facility, AT&T-
13STATE will provide use of that feature, function, or capability for a period of time (47 CFR § 51.309(c)).
2.9 AT&T-13STATE will maintain, repair, or replace Lawful UNEs (47 CFR § 51.309(c)) as provided for in this
Agreement.
2.10 To the extent technically feasible, the quality of the Lawful UNE and access to such Lawful UNE shall be at
least equal to what AT&T-13STATE provides other telecommunications carriers requesting access to the
Lawful UNE (47 CFR § 51.311(a), (b)).
2.11 Each Party shall be solely responsible for the services it provides to its End Users and to other
Telecommunications Carriers.
2.12 Lawful UNEs provided to CLEC under the provisions of this Appendix shall remain the property of AT&T-
13STATE.
2.13 Performance of Lawful UNEs
2.13.1 Each Lawful UNE will be provided in accordance with AT&T-13STATE Technical Publications or
other written descriptions, if any, as changed from time to time by AT&T-13STATE at its sole
discretion.

2.13.2 Nothing in this Appendix shall limit either Party’s ability to upgrade its network through the
incorporation of new equipment, new software or otherwise or to otherwise change and/or modify its
network including, without limitation, through the retirement and/or replacement of equipment,
software or otherwise. Each Party agrees to comply with the Network Disclosure rules adopted by
the FCC in CC Docket No. 96-98, Second Report and Order, codified at 47 C.F.R. 51.325 through
51.335, as such rules maybe amended from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”). AT&T-
13STATE will not discontinue any Lawful UNE that AT&T-13STATE is required to provide to CLEC
under this Agreement unless and until:(i) AT&T-13STATE provides requisite notice of the planned
network change and/or modification in accordance with the Network Disclosure Rules (when
applicable) and no objection is made to AT&T-13STATE's proposed network modification(s) and/or
change(s) or any objection(s) is denied or deemed denied under such Rules; or(ii)if and when
applicable, following AT&T-13STATE's exercise of its rights under applicable law and/or this
Agreement including, without limitation, the intervening law/change in law provisions in this
Agreement; or (iii)to the extent otherwise permitted in this Agreement.
2.13.3 AT&T-13STATE may elect to conduct upgrades or conversions for the improvement of its network
or systems. During such upgrades or conversions, CLEC orders for Lawful UNEs from affected wire
center(s) may be suspended for a period of a few days prior and one day after the upgrade or
conversion date, consistent with the suspension AT&T-13STATE places on itself for orders from its
End Users and other CLEC customers.
2.13.4 CLEC will be solely responsible, at its own expense, for the overall design of its Telecommunications
Services and for any redesigning or rearrangement of its Telecommunications Services which may
be required because of changes in facilities, operations, or procedure of AT&T-13STATE, minimum
network protection criteria, or operating or maintenance characteristics of the facilities.
2.14 Conditions for Access to Lawful UNEs
2.14.1 In order to access and use Lawful UNEs, CLEC must be a Telecommunications Carrier (Section
251(c)(3), and must use the Lawful UNE(s) for the provision of a Telecommunications Service
(Section 251(c)(3)) as permitted by the FCC. Together, these conditions are the “Statutory
Conditions” for access to Lawful UNEs. Accordingly, CLEC hereby represents and warrants that it is
a Telecommunications Carrier and that it will notify AT&T-13STATE immediately in writing if it
ceases to be a Telecommunications Carrier. Failure to so notify AT&T-13STATE shall constitute
material breach of this Agreement.
2.14.1.1 By way of example, use of a Lawful UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination
with other UNEs (Lawful or otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or
otherwise) to provide service to CLEC or for other administrative purpose(s) does not
constitute using a Lawful UNE pursuant to the Statutory Conditions.
2.14.1.2 By way of further example, CLEC may not access Lawful UNEs for the exclusive provision
of mobile wireless services, or long distance services or interexchange services
(telecommunications service between different stations in different exchange areas).
2.14.2 Other conditions to accessing and using any Lawful UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in
combination with other Lawful UNEs, with a network element possessed by CLEC, or otherwise)
may be applicable under lawful and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC and
judicial orders and will also apply.
2.15 New Combinations Involving Lawful UNEs
2.15.1 Subject to the provisions hereof and upon CLEC request, AT&T-13STATE shall meet its combining
obligations involving Lawful UNEs as and to the extent required by FCC rules and orders, and
Verizon Comm. Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467(May 13, 2002) (“Verizon Comm. Inc.”) and, to the extent
not inconsistent therewith, the rules and orders of relevant state Commission and any other
Applicable Law.

2.15.1.1 Any combining obligation is limited solely to combining of Lawful UNEs; accordingly, no
other facilities, services or functionalities are subject to combining, including but not limited
to facilities, services or functionalities that AT&T-13STATE might offer pursuant to Section
271 of the Act.
2.15.2 In the event that AT&T-13STATE denies a request to perform the functions necessary to combine
Lawful UNEs or to perform the functions necessary to combine Lawful UNEs with elements
possessed by CLEC, AT&T-13STATE shall provide written notice to CLEC of such denial and the
basis thereof. Any dispute over such denial shall be addressed using the dispute resolution
procedures applicable to this Agreement. In any dispute resolution proceeding, AT&T-13STATE
shall have the burden to prove that such denial meets one or more applicable standards for denial,
including without limitation those under the FCC rules and orders, Verizon Comm. Inc. and the
Agreement, including Section 2.15 of this Appendix.
2.15.3 In accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Section 2.15, including Section 2.15.3.2 and
2.15.5, the new Lawful UNE combinations, if any, set forth in the Schedule(s) – Lawful UNE
Combinations attached and incorporated into this Appendix shall be made available to CLEC as
specified in the specific Schedule for a particular State.
2.15.3.1 The Parties acknowledge that the United States Supreme Court in Verizon Comm. Inc.
relied on the distinction between an incumbent local exchange carrier such as AT&T-
13STATE being required to perform the functions necessary to combine Lawful UNEs and
to combine Lawful UNEs with elements possessed by a requesting Telecommunications
Carrier, as compared to an incumbent LEC being required to complete the actual
combination. As of the time this Appendix was agreed-to by the Parties, there has been no
further ruling or other guidance provided on that distinction and what functions constitute
only those that are necessary to such combining. In light of that uncertainty, AT&T-
13STATE is willing to perform the actions necessary to also complete the actual physical
combination for those new Lawful UNE combinations, if any, set forth in the Schedule(s) –
Lawful UNE Combinations to this Appendix, subject to the following:
2.15.3.1.1 Section 2.15, including any acts taken pursuant thereto, shall not in any way
prohibit, limit or otherwise affect, or act as a waiver by, AT&T-13STATE from
pursuing any of its rights, remedies or arguments, including but not limited to
those with respect to Verizon Comm. Inc., the remand thereof, or any FCC or
Commission or court proceeding, including its right to seek legal review or a
stay of any decision regarding combinations involving UNEs. Such rights,
remedies, and arguments are expressly reserved by AT&T-13STATE. Without
affecting the foregoing, this Agreement does not in any way prohibit, limit, or
otherwise affect AT&T-13STATE from taking any position with respect to
combinations including Lawful UNEs or any issue or subject addressed or
related thereto.
2.15.3.1.2 Upon the effective date of any regulatory, judicial, or legislative action setting
forth, eliminating, or otherwise delineating or clarifying the extent of an
incumbent LEC’s combining obligations, AT&T-13STATE shall be immediately
relieved of any obligation to perform any non-included combining functions or
other actions under this Agreement or otherwise, and CLEC shall thereafter be
solely responsible for any such non-included functions or other actions. This
Section 2.15.3.1.2 shall apply in accordance with its terms, regardless of
change in law, intervening law or other similarly purposed provision of the
Agreement and, concomitantly, the first sentence of this Section 2.15.3.1.2
shall not affect the applicability of any such provisions in situations not covered
by that first sentence.
2.15.3.1.3 Without affecting the application of Section 2.15.3.1.2 (which shall apply in
accordance with its provisions), upon notice by AT&T-13STATE, the Parties

shall engage in good faith negotiations to amend the Agreement to set forth
and delineate those functions or other actions that go beyond the ILEC
obligation to perform the functions necessary to combine Lawful UNEs and
combine Lawful UNEs with elements possessed by a requesting
Telecommunications Carrier, and to eliminate any AT&T-13STATE obligation
to perform such functions or other actions. If those negotiations do not reach a
mutually agreed-to amendment within sixty (60) days after the date of any such
notice, the remaining disputes between the parties regarding those functions
and other actions that go beyond those functions necessary to combine Lawful
UNEs and combine Lawful UNEs with elements possessed by a requesting
Telecommunications Carrier, shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute
resolution process provided for in this Agreement. Such a notice can be given
at any time, and from time to time.
2.15.3.2 A new Lawful UNE combination, if any, listed on a Schedule –Lawful UNE Combinations
does not imply or otherwise indicate the availability of related support system capabilities,
including without limitation, whether electronic ordering is available for any particular
included new Lawful UNE combination in one or more States. Where electronic ordering is
not available, manual ordering shall be used.
2.15.3.3 For a new Lawful UNE combination, if any, listed on a Schedule – Lawful UNE
Combinations, CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests. These requests will be
processed by AT&T-13STATE, and CLEC will be charged the applicable Lawful UNE
service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each
individual Lawful UNE and cross connect ordered.
2.15.3.4 Upon notice by AT&T-13STATE, the Parties shall engage in good faith negotiations to
amend the Agreement to include a fee(s) for any work performed by AT&T-13STATE in
providing the new Lawful UNE combinations, if any, set forth in Schedule(s) – Lawful UNE
Combinations, which work is not covered by the charges applicable per Section 2.16.3.3.
For any such work done by AT&T-13STATE under Section 2.16.1, any such fee(s) shall be
a reasonable cost-based fee, and shall be calculated using the Time and Material charges
as reflected in State-specific pricing. For any such work that is not so required to be done
by AT&T-13STATE, any such fee(s) shall be at a market-based rate. If those negotiations
do not reach a mutually agreed-to amendment within sixty (60) days after the date of any
such notice, the remaining disputes between the parties concerning any such fee(s) shall
be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process provided for in this Agreement.
Such a notice can be given at any time, and from time to time.
2.15.4 In accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Section 2.15, any request not included in
Section 2.15.3 in which CLEC wants AT&T-13STATE to perform the functions necessary to
combine Lawful UNEs or to perform the functions necessary to combine Lawful UNEs with elements
possessed by CLEC (as well as requests where CLEC also wants AT&T-13STATE to complete the
actual combination), shall be made by CLEC in accordance with the bona fide request (BFR)
process set forth in this Agreement.
2.15.4.1 In any such BFR, CLEC must designate among other things the Lawful UNE(s) sought to
be combined and the needed location(s), the order in which the Lawful UNEs and any
CLEC elements are to be connected, and how each connection (e.g., cross-connected) is
to be made between an AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE and the lawful network element(s)
possessed by CLEC.
2.15.4.2 In addition to any other applicable charges, CLEC shall be charged a reasonable cost-
based fee for any combining work done by AT&T-13STATE under Section 2.15.1. Such
fee shall be calculated using the Time and Material charges as reflected in the State-
specific Appendix Pricing. AT&T-13STATE’s Preliminary Analysis to the BFR shall include
an estimate of such fee for the specified combining. With respect to a BFR in which CLEC

requests AT&T-13STATE to perform work not required by Section 2.15.1, CLEC shall be
charged a market-based rate for any such work.
2.15.5 Without affecting the other provisions hereof, the Lawful UNE combining obligations referenced in
this Section 2.15 apply only in situations where each of the following is met:
2.15.5.1 it is technically feasible, including that network reliability and security would not be
impaired;
2.15.5.2 AT&T-13STATE’s ability to retain responsibility for the management, control, and
performance of its network would not be impaired;
2.15.5.3 AT&T-13STATE would not be placed at a disadvantage in operating its own network;
2.15.5.4 it would not undermine the ability of other Telecommunications Carriers to obtain access to
Lawful UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-13STATE’s network; and
2.15.5.5 CLEC is
2.15.5.5.1 unable to make the combination itself; or
2.15.5.5.2 a new entrant and is unaware that it needs to combine certain Lawful UNEs to
provide a Telecommunications Service, but such obligation under this Section
2.15.5.5 ceases if AT&T-13STATE informs CLEC of such need to combine.
2.15.6 For purposes of Section 2.15.5.5 and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
make a combination itself, CLEC is deemed able to make a combination itself when the Lawful
UNE(s) sought to be combined are available to CLEC, including without limitation:
2.15.6.1 at an AT&T-13STATE premises where CLEC is physically collocated or has an on-site
adjacent collocation arrangement;
2.15.6.2 for AT&T CALIFORNIA only, within an adjacent location arrangement, if and as permitted
by this Agreement.
2.15.7 Section 2.15.5.5 shall only begin to apply thirty (30) days after notice by AT&T-13STATE to CLEC.
Thereafter, AT&T-13STATE may invoke Section 2.15.5.5 with respect to any request for a
combination involving Lawful UNEs.
2.16 Conversion of Wholesale Services to Lawful UNEs
2.16.1 Upon request, AT&T-13STATE shall convert a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to
the equivalent Lawful UNE, or combination of Lawful UNEs, that is available to CLEC under terms
and conditions set forth in this Appendix, so long as the CLEC and the wholesale service, or group
of wholesale services, and the Lawful UNEs, or combination of Lawful UNEs, that would result from
the conversion meet the eligibility criteria that may be applicable. (By way of example only, the
statutory conditions would constitute one such eligibility criterion.)
2.16.2 Where processes for the conversion requested pursuant to this Appendix are not already in place,
AT&T-13STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and
conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable Change Management guidelines.
2.16.3 Except as agreed to by the Parties or otherwise provided hereunder, AT&T-13STATE shall not
impose any untariffed termination charges, or any disconnect fees, re-connect fees, or charges
associated with establishing a service for the first time, in connection with any conversion between a
wholesale service or group of wholesale services and a UNE or combination of UNEs. AT&T-
13STATE may charge applicable service order charges and record change charges.
2.16.4 This Section 2.16 only applies to situations where the wholesale service, or group of wholesale
services, is comprised solely of Lawful UNEs offered or otherwise provided for in this Appendix.
2.16.5 If CLEC does not meet the applicable eligibility criteria or, for any reason, stops meeting the eligibility
criteria for a particular conversion of a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the
equivalent Lawful UNE, or combination of Lawful UNEs, CLEC shall not request such conversion or
Page 318 of 551

APPENDIX LAWFUL UNES (Post-TRRO)/AT&T-13STATE
PAGE 15 OF 46

062907
continue using such the Lawful UNE or Lawful UNEs that result from such conversion. To the extent
CLEC fails to meet (including ceases to meet) the eligibility criteria applicable to a Lawful UNE or
combination of Lawful UNEs, or Commingled Arrangement (as defined herein), AT&T-13STATE
may convert the Lawful UNE or Lawful UNE combination, or Commingled Arrangement, to the
equivalent wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, upon written notice to CLEC.
2.16.5.1 This Section 2.16.5 applies to any Lawful UNE or combination of Lawful UNEs, including
whether or not such Lawful UNE or combination of Lawful UNEs had been previously
converted from an AT&T-13STATE service.
2.16.5.2 AT&T-13STATE may exercise its rights provided for hereunder and those allowed by
law in auditing compliance with any applicable eligibility criteria.
2.16.6 In requesting a conversion of an AT&T-13STATE service, CLEC must follow the guidelines and
ordering requirements provided by AT&T-13STATE that are applicable to converting the particular
AT&T-13STATE service sought to be converted.
2.16.7 Nothing contained in this Appendix or Agreement provides CLEC with an opportunity to supersede
or dissolve existing contractual arrangements, or otherwise affects AT&T-13STATE’s ability to
enforce any tariff, contractual, or other provision(s), including those providing for early termination
liability or similar charges.
2.17 Commingling
2.17.1 “Commingling” means the connecting, attaching, or otherwise linking of a Lawful UNE, or a
combination of Lawful UNEs, to one or more facilities or services that CLEC has obtained at
wholesale from AT&T-13STATE, or the combining of a Lawful UNE, or a combination of Lawful
UNEs, with one or more such facilities or services. “Commingle” means the act of commingling.
2.17.1.1 “Commingled Arrangement” means the arrangement created by Commingling.
2.17.1.2 Neither Commingling nor a Commingled Arrangement shall include, involve, or otherwise
encompass an AT&T-12STATE offering pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 271 that is not a Lawful
UNE under 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(3).
2.17.1.3 Commingling is not permitted, nor is AT&T-13STATE required to perform the functions
necessary to Commingle, where the Commingled Arrangement (i) is not technically
feasible, including that network reliability and security would be impaired; or (ii) would
impair AT&T-13STATE’s ability to retain responsibility for the management, control, and
performance of its network; or (iii) would place AT&T-13STATE at a disadvantage in
operating its own network; or (iv) would undermine the ability of other Telecommunications
Carriers to obtain access to Lawful UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-13STATE’s
network.
2.17.1.4 Where processes for any Commingling requested pursuant to this Agreement (including, by
way of example, for existing services sought to be converted to a Commingled
Arrangement) are not already in place, AT&T-13STATE will develop and implement
processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and conditions. The Parties will comply
with any applicable Change Management guidelines.
2.17.1.5 Any commingling obligation is limited solely to commingling of one or more facilities or
services that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-13STATE with Lawful UNEs;
accordingly, no other facilities, services or functionalities are subject to commingling,
including but not limited to facilities, services or functionalities that AT&T-12STATE might
offer pursuant to Section 271 of the Act.
2.17.2 Except as provided in Section 2 and, further, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
AT&T-13STATE shall permit CLEC to Commingle a Lawful UNE or a combination of Lawful UNEs
with facilities or services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-13STATE to the extent required by lawful
and effective FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC and judicial orders.

2.17.3 Upon request, and subject to this Section 2, AT&T-13STATE shall perform the functions necessary
to Commingle a Lawful UNE or a combination of Lawful UNEs with one or more facilities or services
that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-13STATE (as well as requests where CLEC also
wants AT&T-13STATE to complete the actual Commingling), except that AT&T-13STATE shall
have no obligation to perform the functions necessary to Commingle (or to complete the actual
Commingling) if (i) Section 2.17.1.3 applies to the Commingled Arrangement sought by CLEC; or (ii)
the CLEC is able to perform those functions itself. Where CLEC is a new entrant and is unaware
that it needs to Commingle to provide a Telecommunications Service, AT&T-13STATE’s obligation
to commingle ceases if AT&T-13STATE informs CLEC of such need to Commingle.
2.17.3.1 For purposes of Section 2.17.3 and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be
able to Commingle for itself, CLEC is deemed able to Commingle for itself when the Lawful
UNE(s), Lawful UNE combination, and facilities or services obtained at wholesale from
AT&T-13STATE are available to CLEC, including without limitation:
2.17.3.1.1 at an AT&T-13STATE central office where CLEC is physically collocated or has
an on-site adjacent collocation arrangement;
2.17.3.1.2 for AT&T CALIFORNIA only, within an adjacent location arrangement, if and as
permitted by this Agreement.
2.17.3.2 Section 2.17.3(ii) shall only begin to apply thirty (30) days after notice by AT&T-13STATE
to CLEC. Thereafter, AT&T-13STATE may invoke Section 2.17.3(ii) with respect to any
request for Commingling.
2.17.4 In accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Section 2.17, any request by CLEC for
AT&T-13STATE to perform the functions necessary to Commingle (as well as requests where CLEC
also wants AT&T-13STATE to complete the actual Commingling), shall be made by CLEC in
accordance with this Agreement.
2.17.4.1 AT&T-13STATE is developing a list of Commingled Arrangements that will be available for
ordering, which list will be made available in the CLEC Handbook and posted on “CLEC
Online.” Once that list is included in the CLEC Handbook or posted, whichever is earlier,
CLEC will be able to submit orders for any Commingled Arrangement on that list. The list
may be modified, from time to time.
2.17.4.2 Any CLEC request for a Commingled Arrangement not found on the then-existing list of
orderable Commingled Arrangements must be submitted via the bona fide request (BFR)
process. In any such BFR, CLEC must designate among other things the Lawful UNE(s),
combination of Lawful UNEs, and the facilities or services that CLEC has obtained at
wholesale from AT&T-13STATE sought to be Commingled and the needed location(s), the
order in which such Lawful UNEs, such combinations of Lawful UNEs, and such facilities
and services are to be Commingled, and how each connection (e.g., cross-connected) is to
be made between them.
2.17.4.2.1 In addition to any other applicable charges, CLEC shall be charged a
reasonable fee for any Commingling work done by AT&T-13STATE under this
Section 2.17 (including performing the actual Commingling). Such fee shall be
calculated using the Time and Material charges as reflected in the State-
specific Appendix Pricing. AT&T-13STATE’s Preliminary Analysis to the BFR
shall include an estimate of such fee for the specified Commingling. With
respect to a BFR in which CLEC requests AT&T-13STATE to perform work not
required by this Section 2.17.4, CLEC shall be charged a market-based rate for
any such work.
2.17.4.3 AT&T-13STATE shall charge the appropriate non-recurring rates as set forth in the pricing
schedule(s) applicable to the Lawful UNEs (or Lawful UNE combinations) that are
Commingled on a Lawful UNE-by-Lawful UNE basis, and for the facilities and services that
are Commingled (under this Section 2) on a facility-by-facility, service-by-service basis,
Page 320 of 551

APPENDIX LAWFUL UNES (Post-TRRO)/AT&T-13STATE

including without limitation for the type of service and activity being requested to create the
Commingled Arrangement.
2.17.5 AT&T-13STATE shall not be required to, and shall not, provide “ratcheting” as a result of
Commingling or a Commingled Arrangement. As a general matter, “ratcheting” is a pricing
mechanism that involves billing a single circuit at multiple rates to develop a single, blended rate.
AT&T-13STATE shall charge the rates for Lawful UNEs (or Lawful UNE combinations) Commingled
with facilities or services obtained at wholesale (including for example special access services) on
an element-by-element basis, and such facilities and services on a facility-by-facility, service-by-
service basis.
2.17.6 Nothing in this Agreement shall impose any obligation on AT&T-13STATE to allow or otherwise
permit Commingling, a Commingled Arrangement, or to perform the functions necessary to
Commingle, or to allow or otherwise permit CLEC to Commingle or to make a Commingled
Arrangement, beyond those obligations imposed by the Act, as determined by lawful and effective
FCC rules and associated lawful and effective FCC and judicial orders. The preceding includes
without limitation that AT&T-13STATE shall not be obligated to Commingle network elements that
do not constitute Lawful UNEs, or where Lawful UNEs are not requested for permissible purposes.
If CLEC does not meet the applicable eligibility criteria or, for any reason, stops meeting the eligibility
criteria for a particular Lawful UNE involved or to be involved in a Commingled Arrangement, CLEC
shall not request such Commingled Arrangement or continue using such Commingled Arrangement.
2.17.7 In the event that Commingling also involves AT&T-13STATE performing the functions necessary to
combine Lawful UNEs (e.g., make a new combination of Lawful UNEs), including making the actual
Lawful UNE combination, then Section 2.16 shall govern with respect to that Lawful UNE combining
aspect of that particular Commingling and/or Commingled Arrangement.
2.17.8 Subject to this 2.17, AT&T-13STATE shall not deny access to a Lawful UNE or a combination of
Lawful UNEs on the grounds that one or more of the Lawful UNEs is connected to, attached to,
linked to, or combined with, a facility or service obtained at wholesale from AT&T-13STATE.
2.17.9 Commingling in its entirety (including its definition, the ability of CLEC to Commingle, AT&T-
12STATE’s obligation to perform the functions necessary to Commingle, and Commingled
Arrangements) shall not apply to or otherwise include, involve or encompass AT&T-12STATE
offerings pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 271 that are not Lawful UNEs under 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(3).
2.18 Mandatory Eligibility Criteria for Access to Certain Lawful UNEs
2.18.1 Except as provided below in this Section 2.18 or elsewhere in the Agreement and subject to this
Section and Section 2.16, Conversion of Wholesale Services to UNEs, of this Appendix, AT&T-
13STATE shall provide access to UNEs and combinations of UNEs without regard to whether the
CLEC seeks access to the UNEs to establish a new circuit or to convert an existing circuit from a
service to UNEs.
2.18.1.1 “Enhanced Extended Link” or “EEL” means a UNE combination consisting of an unbundled
loop(s) and Unbundled Dedicated Transport, together with any facilities, equipment, or
functions necessary to combine those UNEs (including, for example, multiplexing
capabilities). An DS1 or higher EEL is required to terminate in a collocation arrangement
that meets the requirements of Section 2.18.3 of this Appendix (e.g., the end of the
Unbundled Dedicated Transport that is opposite the end connected to the UNE local loop,
must be accessed by CLEC at such a CLEC collocation arrangement via a cross-connect).
2.18.2 AT&T-13STATE is not obligated, and shall not, provide access to (1) an unbundled DS1 loop in
combination, or Commingled, with a dedicated DS1 transport facility or service or a dedicated DS3
or higher transport facility or service, or an unbundled DS3 loop in combination, or Commingled, with
a dedicated DS3 or higher transport facility or service, or (2) an unbundled dedicated DS1 transport
facility in combination, or Commingled, with an unbundled DS1 loop or a DS1 channel termination
service, or to an unbundled dedicated DS3 transport facility in combination, or Commingled, with an

unbundled DS1 loop or a DS1 channel termination service, or to an unbundled DS3 loop or a DS3 or
higher channel termination service (collectively, the “Included Arrangements”), unless CLEC certifies
that all of the following conditions are met with respect to the arrangement being sought:
2.18.2.1 CLEC (directly and not via an Affiliate) has received state certification to provide local voice
service in the area being served or, in the absence of a state certification requirement, has
complied with registration, tariffing, filing fee, or other regulatory requirements applicable to
the provision of local voice service in that area.
2.18.2.2 The following criteria are satisfied for each Included Arrangement, including without
limitation each DS1 circuit, each DS3 circuit, each DS1 EEL and each DS1 equivalent
circuit on a DS3 EEL:
2.18.2.2.1 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be assigned a local telephone
number (NPA-NXX-XXXX) that is associated with local service provided within
an AT&T-13STATE local service area and within the LATA where the circuit is
located (“Local Telephone Number”), prior to the provision of service over that
circuit (and for each circuit, CLEC will provide the corresponding Local
Telephone Number(s) as part of the required certification); and
2.18.2.2.2 Each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 EEL or on any other Included
Arrangement, must have its own Local Telephone Number assignment, so that
each DS3 must have at least 28 Local voice Telephone Numbers assigned to it;
and
2.18.2.2.3 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will have 911 or E911 capability
prior to the provision of service over that circuit; and
2.18.2.2.4 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will terminate in a collocation
arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 2.18.3 of this Appendix
Lawful UNE; and
2.18.2.2.5 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be served by an
interconnection trunk that meets the requirements of Section 2.18.4 of this
Appendix Lawful UNE; and
2.18.2.2.6 For each 24 DS1 EELs, or other facilities having equivalent capacity, CLEC will
have at least one active DS1 local service interconnection trunk that meets the
requirements of Section 2.18.4 of this Appendix; and
2.18.2.2.7 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be served by a switch capable
of providing local voice traffic.
By way of example only, the application of the foregoing conditions means that a wholesale or retail
DS1 or higher service/circuit (whether intrastate or interstate in nature or jurisdiction) comprised, in
whole or in part, of a UNE local loop-Unbundled Dedicated Transport(s)-UNE local loop (with or
without multiplexing) cannot qualify for at least the reason that the UNE local loop-Unbundled
Dedicated Transport combination included within that service/circuit does not terminate to a
collocation arrangement. Accordingly, AT&T-13STATE shall not be required to provide, and shall
not provide, any UNE combination of a UNE local loop and Unbundled Dedicated Transport at DS1
or higher (whether as a UNE combination by themselves, with a network element possessed by
CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling, or whether as a new arrangement or from a conversion of an
existing service/circuit) that does not terminate to a collocation arrangement that meets the
requirements of Section 2.18.3 of this Appendix Lawful UNE. Section 2.18.2 shall apply in any
arrangement that includes more than one of the UNEs, facilities, or services set forth in that Section,
including, without limitation, to any arrangement where one or more UNEs, facilities, or services not
set forth in Section 2.18.2 is also included or otherwise used in that arrangement (whether as part of
a UNE combination, Commingled Arrangement, or otherwise), and irrespective of the placement or
sequence of them.

2.18.3 A collocation arrangement meets the requirements of Section 2.18 of this Appendix Lawful UNE if it
is:
2.18.3.1 Established pursuant to Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and located at AT&T-13STATE’s
premises within the same LATA as the End User’s premises, when AT&T-13STATE is not
the collocator; or
2.18.3.2 Located at a third party’s premises within the same LATA as the End User’s premises,
when AT&T-13STATE is the collocator.
2.18.4 An interconnection trunk meets the requirements of Sections 2.18.2.2.5 and 2.18.2.2.6 of this
Appendix Lawful UNE if CLEC will transmit the calling party’s Local Telephone Number in
connection with calls exchanged over the trunk, and the trunk is located in the same LATA as the
End User premises served by the Included Arrangement.
2.18.5 For a new circuit to which Section 2.18.2 applies, CLEC may initiate the ordering process if CLEC
certifies that it will not begin to provide any service over that circuit until a Local Telephone Number
is assigned and 911/E911 capability is provided, as required by Section 2.18.2.2.1 and Section
2.18.2.2.3, respectively. In such case, CLEC shall satisfy Section 2.18.2.2.1 and/or Section
2.18.2.2.3 if it assigns the required Local Telephone Number(s), and implements 911/E911
capability, within 30 days after AT&T-13STATE provisions such new circuit. CLEC must provide
AT&T-13STATE with sufficient proof that such assignment and/or implementation has occurred by
the end of such 30th day.
2.18.5.1 Section 2.18.5 does not apply to existing circuits to which Section 2.18.2 applies, including
conversions or migrations (e.g., CLEC shall not be excused from meeting the Section
2.18.2.2.1 and Section 2.18.2.2.3 requirements for existing circuits at the time it initiates the
ordering process).
2.18.6 CLEC hereby agrees that by submitting an order to AT&T-13STATE for an Included Arrangement
(whether new, as a result of a requested conversion, or otherwise), CLEC is certifying that it meets
and will continue to meet the requirements of Section 2.18 as to such Included Arrangement(s) on a
circuit-by-circuit/service-by-service/Included Arrangement-by-Included Arrangement basis. Such
certification-by-order shall have the same weight and effect as a separate certification. and
certification-by-order shall not diminish or otherwise affect CLEC’s obligation to meet and to continue
to comply with the criteria or certification requirements set forth in this Section 2.18.
2.18.6.1 If the information previously provided in a certification is inaccurate (or ceases to be
accurate), CLEC shall update such certification promptly with AT&T-13STATE.
2.18.7 In addition to any other audit rights provided for this Agreement and those allowed by law, AT&T-
13STATE may obtain and pay for an independent auditor to audit CLEC, on an annual basis,
applied on a State-by-State basis, for compliance with this Section 2.18. For purposes of calculating
and applying an “annual basis”, it means for a State a consecutive 12-month period, beginning upon
AT&T-13STATE’s written notice that an audit will be performed for that State, subject to Section
2.18.7.4 of this Section.
2.18.7.1 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties (including at the time of the audit), the independent
auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the standards established by the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which will require the auditor
to perform an “examination engagement” and issue an opinion regarding CLEC’s
compliance with the qualifying service eligibility criteria.
2.18.7.2 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all material
respects with this Section 2.18.
2.18.7.3 Consistent with standard auditing practices, such audits require compliance testing
designed by the independent auditor, which typically include an examination of a sample
selected in accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment.

2.18.7.4 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with
this Section 2.18, CLEC must true-up any difference in payments beginning from the date
that the non-compliant circuit was established as a UNE/UNE combination, in whole or in
part (notwithstanding any other provision hereof), CLEC must convert the UNE or UNE
combination, or Commingled Arrangement, to an equivalent or substantially similar
wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, (and AT&T-13STATE may initiate and
affect such a conversion on its own without any further consent by CLEC), and CLEC shall
timely make the correct payments on a going-forward basis, and all applicable remedies for
failure to make such payments shall be available to AT&T-13STATE. In no event shall
rates set under Section 252(d)(1) of the Act apply for the use of any UNE for any period in
which CLEC does not meet the conditions set forth in this Section 2.18 for that UNE,
arrangement, or circuit, as the case may be. Also, the “annual basis” calculation and
application shall be immediately reset, e.g., AT&T-13STATE shall not have to wait the
remaining part of the consecutive 12-month period before it is permitted to audit again in
that State.
2.18.7.4.1 To the extent that the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed
to comply in all material respects with this Section 2.18, CLEC must reimburse
AT&T-13STATE for the cost of the independent auditor and for AT&T-
13STATE’s costs in the same manner and using the same methodology and
rates that AT&T-13STATE is required to pay CLEC’s costs under Section
2.18.7.4.2.
2.18.7.4.2 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that the CLEC
complied in all material respects with this Section 2.18, AT&T-13STATE must
reimburse CLEC for its reasonable staff time and other reasonable costs
associated in responding to the audit (e.g., collecting data in response to the
auditor’s inquiries, meeting for interviews, etc.).
2.18.7.5 CLEC will maintain the appropriate documentation to support its eligibility certifications,
including without limitation call detail records, Local Telephone Number assignment
documentation, and switch assignment documentation.
2.18.8 Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel,
laches, or similar concepts in other situations, CLEC shall fully comply with this Section 2.18 in all
cases and, further, the failure of AT&T-13STATE to require such compliance, including if AT&T-
13STATE provides a circuit(s), an EEL(s), or a Commingled circuit, that does not meet any eligibility
criteria, including those in this Section 2.18, shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and
estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not act to affect any rights or requirements
hereunder.
2.19 Where processes for any Lawful UNE requested pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or in
conjunction with any other UNE(s) or service(s), are not already in place, AT&T-13STATE will develop and
implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and conditions. The Parties will comply with
any applicable Change Management guidelines.
2.20 AT&T-13STATE will combine Lawful UNEs, combine Lawful UNE(s) with network elements possessed by
CLEC, and/or Commingle only as set forth in this Appendix Lawful UNEs.
2.21 The Parties intend that this Appendix Lawful UNEs contains the sole and exclusive terms and conditions by
which CLEC will obtain Lawful UNEs from AT&T-13STATE. Accordingly, except as may be specifically
permitted by this Appendix Lawful UNEs, and then only to the extent permitted, CLEC and its affiliated
entities hereby fully and irrevocably waive any right or ability any of them might have to purchase any
unbundled network element (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs (Lawful or
otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling or otherwise) directly
from any AT&T-13STATE tariff, to the extent such tariff(s) is/are available, and agree not to so purchase or
attempt to so purchase from any such tariff. Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other

6.3 Item I
AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA Bona Fide Request Process
6.3.1 A Bona Fide Request (“BFR”) is the process by which CLEC may request AT&T-10STATE, AT&T
NEVADA to provide CLEC access to an additional or new, undefined Lawful UNE, Lawful UNE
Combination and/or Lawful Commingling requests that constitute or involve a Lawful UNE required
to be provided by AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA but that is not available under this Agreement at
the time of CLEC’s request.
6.3.2 The BFR process set forth herein does not apply to those services requested pursuant to Report &
Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 91-141 (rel. Oct. 19, 1992) paragraph 259 and n. 603
and subsequent rulings.
6.3.3 All BFRs must be submitted with a BFR Application Form in accordance with the specifications and
processes set forth in the respective sections of the CLEC Handbook. Included with the Application
CLEC shall provide a technical description of each requested Lawful UNE, drawings when
applicable, the location(s) where needed, the date required, and the projected quantity to be ordered
with a 3 year forecast.
6.3.4 CLEC is responsible for all costs incurred by AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA to review, analyze
and process a BFR. When submitting a BFR Application Form, CLEC has two options to
compensate AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA for its costs incurred to complete the Preliminary
Analysis of the BFR:
6.3.4.1 Include with its BFR Application Form a $2,000 deposit to cover AT&T-10STATE, AT&T
NEVADA’s preliminary evaluation costs, in which case AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA
may not charge CLEC in excess of $2,000 to complete the Preliminary Analysis; or
6.3.4.2 Not make the $2,000 deposit, in which case CLEC shall be responsible for all preliminary
evaluation costs incurred by AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA to complete the preliminary
Analysis (regardless of whether such costs are greater or less than $2,000).
6.3.5 If CLEC submits a $2,000 deposit with its BFR, and AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA is not able to
process the Request or determines that the Request does not qualify for BFR treatment, then AT&T-
10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will return the $2,000 deposit to CLEC. Similarly, if the costs incurred to
complete the Preliminary Analysis are less than $2,000, the balance of the deposit will, at the option
of CLEC, either be refunded or credited toward additional developmental costs authorized by CLEC.
6.3.6 Upon written notice, CLEC may cancel a BFR at any time, but will pay AT&T-10STATE, AT&T
NEVADA its reasonable and demonstrable costs of processing and/or implementing the BFR up to
and including the date AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA received notice of cancellation. If
cancellation occurs prior to completion of the preliminary evaluation, and a $2,000 deposit has been
made by CLEC, and the reasonable and demonstrable costs are less than $2,000, the remaining
balance of the deposit will be, at the option of the CLEC, either returned to CLEC or credited toward
additional developmental costs authorized by CLEC.
6.3.7 AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will promptly consider and analyze each BFR it receives. Within
ten (10) Business Days of its receipt AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will acknowledge receipt of
the BFR and in such acknowledgement advice CLEC of the need for any further information needed
to process the Request. CLEC acknowledges that the time intervals set forth in this Appendix
begins once AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA has received a complete and accurate BFR
Application Form and, if applicable, $2,000 deposit.
6.3.8 Except under extraordinary circumstances, within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of a
complete and accurate BFR AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will provide to CLEC a preliminary
analysis of such Request (the “Preliminary Analysis”). The Preliminary Analysis will (i) indicate that
AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will offer the Request to CLEC or (ii) advise CLEC that AT&T-
10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will not offer the Request. If AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA indicates

it will not offer the Request, AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will provide a detailed explanation for
the denial. Possible explanations may be, but are not limited to: (i) access to the Request is not
technically feasible, (ii) that the Request is not for a Lawful UNE, or is otherwise not required to be
provided by AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA under the Act and/or, (iii) that the BFR is not the
correct process for the request.
6.3.9 If the Preliminary Analysis indicates that AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA will offer the Request,
CLEC may, at its discretion, provide written authorization for AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA to
develop the Request and prepare a “BFR Quote”. The BFR Quote shall, as applicable, include (i)
the first date of availability, (ii) installation intervals, (iii) applicable rates (recurring, nonrecurring and
other), (iv) BFR development and processing costs and (v) terms and conditions by which the
Request shall be made available. CLEC’s written authorization to develop the BFR Quote must be
received by AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA within thirty (30) calendar days of CLEC’s receipt of
the Preliminary Analysis. If no authorization to proceed is received within such thirty (30) calendar
day period, the BFR will be deemed canceled and CLEC will pay to AT&T-10STATE, AT&T
NEVADA all demonstrable costs as set forth above. Any request by CLEC for AT&T-10STATE,
AT&T NEVADA to proceed with a Request received after the thirty (30) calendar day window will
require CLEC to submit a new BFR.
6.3.10 As soon as feasible, but not more than ninety (90) calendar days after its receipt of authorization to
develop the BFR Quote, AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA shall provide to CLEC a BFR Quote.
6.3.11 Within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of the BFR Quote, CLEC must either (i) confirm its order
pursuant to the BFR Quote (ii) cancel its BFR and reimburse AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA for
its costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, or (iii) if it believes the BFR Quote is inconsistent
with the requirements of the Act and/or this Appendix, exercise its rights under the Dispute
Resolution Process set forth in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement. If AT&T-
10STATE, AT&T NEVADA does not receive notice of any of the foregoing within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, the BFR shall be deemed canceled. CLEC shall be responsible to reimburse
AT&T-10STATE, AT&T NEVADA for its costs incurred up to the date of cancellation (whether
affirmatively canceled or deemed canceled by CLEC).
6.3.12 Unless CLEC agrees otherwise, all rates and costs quoted or invoiced herein shall be consistent
with the pricing principles of the Act.
6.3.13 If a Party believes that the other Party is not requesting, negotiating or processing a BFR in good
faith and/or as required by the Act, or if a Party disputes a determination, or price or cost quote, such
Party may seek relief pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Process set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions section of this Agreement.

7.2 The Lawful UNE Network Interface Device (NID) is defined as any means of interconnection of End User
premises wiring to AT&T-13STATE’s distribution loop facilities, such as a cross connect device used for
that purpose. Fundamentally, the Lawful UNE NID establishes the final (and official) network demarcation
point between the loop and the End User's inside wire. Maintenance and control of the End User's inside
wiring (on the End User's side of the Lawful UNE NID) is under the control of the End User. Conflicts
between telephone service providers for access to the End User's inside wire must be resolved by the End
User. Pursuant to applicable FCC rules, AT&T-13STATE offers nondiscriminatory access to the Lawful
UNE NID on an unbundled basis to CLEC for the provision of a Telecommunications Service. CLEC
access to the Lawful UNE NID is offered as specified below (AT&T-12STATE) or by tariff (AT&T
CONNECTICUT).
7.3 AT&T-12STATE will permit CLEC to connect its local loop facilities to End Users’ premises wiring through
AT&T-12STATE's Lawful UNE NID, or at any other technically feasible point.
7.4 CLEC may connect to the End User’s premises wiring through the AT&T-12STATE Lawful UNE NID, as is,
or at any other technically feasible point. Any repairs, upgrade and rearrangements to the Lawful UNE NID
required by CLEC will be performed by AT&T-12STATE based on Time and Material charges. AT&T-
12STATE, at the request of CLEC, will disconnect the AT&T-12STATE local loop from the Lawful UNE
NID, at charges reflected in the state specific Appendix Pricing.
7.5 With respect to multiple dwelling units or multiple-unit business premises, CLEC will connect directly with
the End User’s premises wire, or may connect with the End User’s premises wire via AT&T-12STATE's
Lawful UNE NID where necessary.
7.6 The AT&T-12STATE Lawful UNE NIDs that CLEC uses under this Appendix will be existing Lawful UNE
NIDs installed by AT&T-12STATE to serve its End Users.
7.7 CLEC shall not attach to or disconnect AT&T-12STATE’s ground. CLEC shall not cut or disconnect AT&T-
12STATE’s loop from the Lawful UNE NID and/or its protector. CLEC shall not cut any other leads in the
Lawful UNE NID.

7.8 CLEC, who has constructed its own NID at a premises and needs only to make contact with AT&T-
12STATE’s Lawful UNE NID, can disconnect the End User’s wiring from AT&T-12STATE’s Lawful UNE
NID and reconnect it to the CLEC’s NID.
7.9 If CLEC requests a different type of Lawful UNE NID not included with the loop, AT&T-12STATE will
consider the requested type of Lawful UNE NID to be facilitated via the Bona Fide Request (BFR) Process.
8. LAWFUL UNE LOCAL LOOP
8.1 Subject to Section 2 of this Appendix Lawful UNEs, AT&T-13STATE shall provide Lawful UNE Local Loop
under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
8.2 Pursuant to applicable FCC rules, a local loop network element is a transmission facility between a
distribution frame (or its equivalent) in an AT&T-13STATE Central Office and the loop demarcation point at
an End User premises. Therefore, consistent with the applicable FCC rules, AT&T-13STATE will make
available the Lawful UNE Local Loops set forth herein below between a distribution frame (or its equivalent)
in an AT&T-13STATE Central Office and the loop demarcation point at an End User premises. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that AT&T-13STATE shall not be obligated to provision any of the Lawful UNE
Local Loops provided for herein to cellular sites or to any other location that does not constitute an End
User premises. Where applicable, the Lawful UNE Local Loop includes all wire within multiple dwelling and
tenant buildings and campuses that provides access to End User premises wiring, provided such wire is
owned and controlled by AT&T-13STATE. The Lawful UNE Local Loop includes all features, functions and
capabilities of the transmission facility, including attached electronics (except those electronics used for the
provision of advanced services, such as Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers), and CLEC requested
line conditioning (subject to applicable charges in Appendix Pricing). The Lawful UNE Local Loop includes,
but is not limited to copper loops (two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade copper loops, digital copper
loops [e.g., DS0s and integrated services digital network lines]), as well as two-wire and four-wire copper
loops conditioned, at CLEC request and subject to charges, to transmit the digital signals needed to provide
digital subscriber line services), Lawful UNE DS1 Digital Loops (where they have not been Declassified and
subject to caps set forth in Section 8.3.4.4.1) and Lawful UNE DS3 Digital Loops (where they have not
been Declassified and subject to caps set forth in Section 8.3.5.4.1), where such loops are deployed and
available in AT&T-13STATE wire centers. CLEC agrees to operate each loop type within applicable
technical standards and parameters.
8.2.1 When a Lawful UNE Local Loop is ordered to a high voltage area, the Parties understand and agree
that such loop will require a High Voltage Protective Equipment (HVPE) (e.g., a positron), to ensure
the safety and integrity of the network, the Parties’ employees and/or representatives, and the
CLEC’s End User. Therefore, any request by CLEC for a Lawful UNE Local Loop to a high voltage
area will be submitted by CLEC to AT&T-13STATE via the BFR process set forth in Section 6
hereinabove and CLEC shall be required to pay AT&T-13STATE for any HVPE that is provisioned
by AT&T-13STATE to CLEC in connection with the CLEC’s Lawful UNE Local Loop order to the
high voltage area.
8.3 The following types of Lawful UNE Local Loops will be provided at the rates, terms, and conditions set forth

8.4 Declassification Procedure
8.4.1 DS1. Subject to the cap described in Section 8.3.4.4.1, AT&T-13STATE shall provide CLEC with
access to a DS1 Lawful UNE Digital Loop, where available, to any building not served by a wire
center with 60,000 or more business lines and four or more (4) fiber-based collocators. Once a wire
center exceeds these thresholds, no future DS1Digital Loop unbundling will be required in that wire
center, or any buildings served by that wire center, and DS1 Digital Loops in that wire center, or any
buildings served by that wire center, shall be Declassified and no longer available as Lawful UNEs
under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease
ordering DS1 Lawful UNE Digital Loops in such wire center(s), or any buildings served by such wire
center(s).
8.4.2 DS3. Subject to the cap described in Section 8.3.5.4.1, AT&T-13STATE shall provide CLEC with
access to a DS3 Lawful UNE Digital Loop, where available, to any building not served by a wire
center with at least 38,000 business lines and at least four (4) fiber-based collocators. Once a wire
center exceeds these thresholds, no future DS3 Digital Loop unbundling will be required in that wire
center, or any buildings served by that wire center, and DS3 Digital Loops in that wire center, or any
buildings served by that wire center, shall be Declassified, and no longer available as Lawful UNEs
under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease
ordering DS3 Lawful UNE Digital Loops in such wire center(s), or any buildings served by such wire
center(s).
8.4.3 Effect on Embedded Base. Upon Declassification of DS1 Digital Loops or DS3 Digital Loops
already purchased by CLEC as Lawful UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE will provide
written notice to CLEC of such Declassification, and proceed in accordance with Section 2.5.
8.4.3.1 Products provided by AT&T-13STATE in conjunction with such Loops (e.g. Cross-
Connects) shall also be subject to re-pricing under this Section and Section 2.5 where such
Loops are Declassified.
8.4.4 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-13STATE under this Section 8.4 shall not be subject to the
Network Disclosure Rules.
8.5 Routine Network Modifications – Lawful UNE Local Loops
8.5.1 AT&T-13STATE shall make routine network modifications to Lawful UNE Local Loop facilities used
by requesting telecommunications carriers where the requested Lawful UNE Local Loop facility has
already been constructed. AT&T-13STATE shall perform routine network modifications to Lawful
UNE Local Loop facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the Lawful UNE
Local Loop facility being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the
specifications, of any carrier.
8.5.2 A routine network modification is an activity that AT&T-13STATE regularly undertakes for its own
customers. Routine network modifications include rearranging or splicing of existing cable; adding
an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater; adding a smart jack; installing a repeater shelf;
adding a line card; deploying a new multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and
attaching electronic and other equipment that the incumbent LEC ordinarily attaches to activate such
loops for its own retail customers, under the same conditions and in the same manner that AT&T-
13STATE does for its own customers. Routine network modifications may entail activities such as
accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable and installing equipment casings.
AT&T-13STATE will place drops in the same manner as it does for its own customers.
8.5.3 Routine network modifications do not include constructing new Lawful UNE Loops; installing new
cable; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new manholes or conduits;
installing new terminals; removing or reconfiguring packetized transmission facility. AT&T-13STATE
is not obligated to perform those activities for a requesting telecommunications carrier.

8.5.4 AT&T-13STATE shall determine whether and how to perform routine network modifications using
the same network or outside plant engineering principles that would be applied in providing service
to AT&T-13STATE’s retail customers.
8.5.5 AT&T-13STATE has no obligation to build TDM capability into new packet-based networks or into
existing packet-based networks that never had TDM capability.
8.5.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-13STATE’s obligations with respect to
routine network modifications apply only where the loop transmission facilities are subject to
unbundling and do not apply to FTTH loops or FTTC loops.
8.5.7 AT&T-12STATE shall provide routine network modifications at the rates, terms and conditions set
out in this Appendix (AT&T-12STATE), and in the state specific Appendix Pricing (AT&T-12STATE)
or by tariff, as such tariff may be modified from time to time (AT&T CONNECTICUT). AT&T-
12STATE will impose charges for Routine Network Modifications in instances where such charges
are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and non-
recurring charges. The Parties agree that the routine network modifications for which AT&T-
12STATE is not recovering costs in existing recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which
costs will be imposed on CLEC on an ICB basis for all AT&T-12STATE include, but are not limited
to,: (i) adding an equipment case, (ii) adding a doubler or repeater including associated line card(s),
(iii) installing a repeater shelf, and any other necessary work and parts associated with a repeater
shelf, and (iv) in AT&T-California only, deploying of multiplexing equipment, to the extent such
equipment is not present on the loop or transport facility when ordered. The resulting ICB rates
shall continue to apply to such routine network modifications unless and until the Parties negotiate
specific rates based upon actual time and materials costs for such routine network modifications or
specific rates are otherwise established for such routine network modifications through applicable
state commission proceedings.
8.6 Lawful UNE DS1 and DS3 Loops may not be employed in combination with transport facilities to replace
Special Access services or facilities, except consistently with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including but not limited to, Section 2.16 of this Appendix.
8.7 xDSL Subloop is as defined in the xDSL and Line Splitting Appendix, if any, and will be available to CLEC
in the AT&T-12STATE states in those instances where CLEC has an approved and effective xDSL and
Line Splitting Appendix as a part of this Agreement. In addition to the provisions set forth in the xDSL and
Line Splitting Appendix, the xDSL Subloop is subject to the subloop terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 9, the collocation provisions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and the rates set forth in the
Appendix Pricing. If there is any conflict between the provisions set forth in the xDSL and Line Splitting
Appendix as to the xDSL Subloop and the subloop provisions set forth in this Section 9, the subloop
provisions set forth in Section 9 shall control.
9. LAWFUL UNE SUBLOOPS
9.1 Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Appendix, AT&T-12STATE shall provide Lawful UNE
Subloops under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
9.2 AT&T-12STATE will provide copper Lawful UNE Subloops as set forth in this Appendix. Other than as
specifically set out elsewhere in this Agreement, AT&T CONNECTICUT does not offer Lawful UNE
Subloops under this Agreement. Rather, Lawful UNE Subloops are available as described in Section 18 of
the Connecticut Service Tariff.
9.2.1 A Lawful UNE Subloop is a smaller included segment of AT&T-12STATE’s Lawful UNE local loop
plant, i.e., a portion of the Lawful UNE Loop from some technically accessible terminal beyond
AT&T-12STATE’s central office and the network demarcation point, including that portion of the
Lawful UNE Loop, if any, which AT&T-12STATE’s owns and controls inside the End User premises.

9.3 Definitions Pertaining to the Lawful UNE Subloop
9 3.1 Accessible terminals contain cables and their respective wire pairs that terminate on screw posts.
This allows technicians to affix cross connects between binding posts of terminals collocated at the
same point. Terminals differ from splice cases, which are inaccessible because the case must be
breached to reach the wires within.
9.3.2 “Dead Count” refers to those binding posts which have cable spliced to them but which cable is not
currently terminated to any terminal to provide service.
9.3.3 “Demarcation Point” is defined as the point on the loop where the ILEC’s control of the wire ceases
and the subscriber’s control (or on the case of some multiunit premises, the landlord's control) of the
wire begins.
9.3.4 “Digital Lawful UNE Subloop” may be deployed on non-loaded copper cable pairs of either 2 Wire or
4 Wire facilities. Where AT&T uses channels of a digital loop carrier system, channels of a fiber
optic transport system or other technologies suitable for the purpose of providing 160 Kbps Lawful
UNE Subloop transport in a Multi Tenant Environment (MTE), such facilities will be unbundled as
part of AT&T's MTE Sub Loop offering. AT&T-13STATE is not required to provide Subloop Dark
Fiber on an unbundled basis.
9 3.5 “Distribution Cable” is defined as the cable from the SAI/FDI to the terminals from which an end user
can be connected to the ILEC’s network.
9.3.6 “MTE” for the purpose of Term To NID Lawful UNE Subloop. “MTE” is a Multi Tenant Environment
for buildings with exterior or interior mounted terminals.
9.3.7 “Network Terminating Wire (NTW)” is the service wire that connects the ILEC’s distribution cable to
the NID at the demarcation point.
9.3.8 “SAI/FDI-to-Term Lawful UNE Subloop” is that portion of the Lawful UNE Loop from the SAI/FDI to
an accessible terminal.
9 3.9 “SAI/FDI-to-NID Lawful UNE Subloop” is that portion of the Lawful UNE Loop from the SAI/FDI to the
Network Interface Device (NID), which is located on an end user’s premise.
9.3.10 “SPOI” is defined as a Single Point of Interconnection. At the request of CLEC, and subject to
charges, AT&T-12STATE will construct a SPOI only to those multiunit premises where AT&T-
12STATE has distribution facilities to the premises and AT&T-12STATE either owns, controls, or
leases the inside wire, if any, at such premises. If AT&T-12STATE has no facilities which it owns,
controls or leases at a multiunit premises through which it serves, or can serve, End Users at such
premises, it is not obligated to construct a SPOI. AT&T-12STATE’s obligation to build a SPOI for
multiunit premises only arises when CLEC indicates that it will place an order for a Lawful UNE
Subloop via a SPOI.
9.3.11 “SAI/FDI” is defined as the point in the ILEC’s network where feeder cable is cross connected to the
distribution cable. “SAI” is Serving Area Interface. “FDI” is Feeder Distribution Interface. The terms
are interchangeable.
9.3.12 “Term-to-NID Lawful UNE Subloop” is that portion of the Lawful UNE Loop from an accessible
terminal to the NID, which is located at an end user’s premise. Term-to-NID Lawful UNE Subloop
includes use of the Network Terminating Wire (NTW).
9.4 AT&T-12STATE will offer the following Lawful UNE Subloop types:
9.4.1 2-Wire Analog Lawful UNE Subloop provides a 2-wire (one twisted pair cable or equivalent) capable
of transporting analog signals in the frequency range of approximately 300 to 3000 hertz
(voiceband).
9.4.2 4-Wire Analog Lawful UNE Subloop provides a 4-wire (two twisted pair cables or equivalent, with
separate transmit and receive paths) capable of transporting analog signals in the frequency range
of approximately 300 to 3000 hertz (voiceband).

062907
9.4.3 Lawful UNE xDSL Subloop is as defined in the xDSL and Line Splitting Appendix and will be
available to CLEC in the AT&T-12STATE states in those instances where CLEC has an approved
and effective xDSL and Line Splitting Appendix as a part of this Agreement. In addition to the
provisions set forth in the xDSL and Line Splitting Appendix, the Lawful UNE xDSL Subloop is
subject to the Lawful UNE subloop terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix, the collocation
provisions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and the rates set forth in the Appendix Pricing. If
there is any conflict between the provisions set forth in the xDSL and Line Splitting Appendix as to
the Lawful UNE xDSL Subloop and the Lawful UNE subloop provisions set forth in this Appendix, the
Lawful UNE subloop provisions set forth in this Appendix shall control.
9.4.4 As no other type of Subloop constitutes a Lawful UNE subloop, AT&T-13STATE is not obligated
under this Section 251/252 Agreement to provide any other type of subloop. CLEC shall not request
such subloops under this Agreement, whether alone, in combination or Commingled. Accordingly, if
CLEC requests and AT&T-13STATE provides a subloop(s) that is not described or provided for in
this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE may, at any time, even after the subloop(s) has been provided to
CLEC, discontinue providing such subloop(s) (including any combination(s) including that subloop)
upon 30 days’ advance written notice to CLEC. Without affecting the application or interpretation of
any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel, laches, or similar concepts in other situations, the
failure of AT&T-13STATE to refuse to provide, including if AT&T-13STATE provides or continues to
provide, access to such subloop(s) (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with UNEs
(Lawful or otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or otherwise), shall not act as a
waiver of any part of this Agreement, and estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not act to
affect any rights or requirements hereunder.
9.5 Intentionally Left Blank.
9.6 Lawful UNE Subloops are provided “as is” unless CLEC requests loop conditioning on Lawful UNE xDSL
Subloops for the purpose of offering advanced services. Lawful UNE xDSL Subloop conditioning will be
provided at the rates, terms, and conditions set out in the state specific Appendix Pricing.
9.7 If a Term to NID Lawful UNE Subloop has been disconnected and thus an end-user is no longer receiving
service via that Lawful UNE Subloop, and such Lawful UNE Subloop has been determined to be a non-
defective pair, then that Lawful UNE Subloop would be considered an existing spare portion of the loop,
based on a first come first served basis.
9.8 Copper Lawful UNE Subloops
9.8.1 Access to terminals for copper Lawful UNE Subloops is defined to include:
• any technically feasible point near the End User premises accessible by a cross-connect (such as
the pole or pedestal, the NID, or the minimum point of entry (MPOE) to the End User premises),
• the Feeder Distribution Interface (FDI) or Serving Area Interface (SAI), where the “feeder” leading
back to the central office and the “distribution” plant branching out to the subscribers meet,
• the Terminal (underground or aerial).
9.9 CLEC may request access to the following copper Lawful UNE Subloop segments:
FROM: TO:
1. Serving Area Interface or
Feeder Distribution Interface Terminal
2. Serving Area Interface or
Feeder Distribution Interface Network Interface Device
3. Terminal Network Interface Device
4. NID Stand Alone
5. SPOI (Single Point of Interface) Terminal
6. SPOI (Single Point of Interface) Terminal

9.10 Provisioning
9.10.1 Connecting Facility Arrangement (CFA) assignments must be in-place prior to ordering and
assigning specific Lawful UNE Subloop circuit(s).
9.10.2 Spare Lawful UNE Subloop(s) will be assigned to CLEC only when an LSR/ASR is processed.
LSR/ASRs will be processed on a “first come first serve” basis.
9.11 Maintenance
9.11.1 The Parties acknowledge that by separating switching, and distribution plant, the ability to perform
mechanized testing and monitoring of the Lawful UNE Subloop from the AT&T-12STATE
switch/testing equipment will be lost.
9 11.2 CLEC shall isolate trouble to the AT&T-12STATE Lawful UNE Subloop portion of the CLEC’s
service before reporting trouble to AT&T-12STATE.
9.11.3 AT&T-12STATE shall charge the CLEC a Maintenance of Service Charge (MSC) when CLEC
dispatches AT&T-12STATE on a trouble report and the fault is determined to be in the CLEC’s
portion of the loop. Such charges may be found in the individual state pricing appendices or tariffs.
9.11.4 Once all Lawful UNE Subloop access arrangements have been completed and balance of payment
due AT&T-12STATE is received, the CLEC may place a LSR for Subloops at this location. Prices
at which AT&T-12STATE agrees to provide CLEC with Lawful UNE Subloops are contained in the
state specific Appendix Pricing.
9.11.5 In the event of Catastrophic Damage to the RT, SAI/FDI, Terminal, SPOI, or NID where CLEC has
a SAA, AT&T-12STATE repair forces will restore service in a non-discriminatory manner which will
allow the greatest number of all End Users to be restored in the least amount of time. Should the
CLEC cabling require replacement, AT&T-12STATE will provide prompt notification to CLEC for
CLEC to provide the replacement cable to be terminated as necessary.
9.12 Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangements
9.12.1 Prior to ordering Lawful UNE Subloop facilities, CLEC will establish Collocation using the
Collocation process as set forth in the Collocation Appendix, or will establish a Lawful UNE Subloop
Access Arrangement utilizing the Special Construction Arrangement (SCA), either of which are
necessary to interconnect to the AT&T-12STATE Lawful UNE Subloop network.
9.12.2 The space available for collocating or obtaining various Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangements
will vary depending on the existing plant at a particular location. The CLEC will initiate an SCA by
submitting a Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement Application.
9 12.3 Upon receipt of a complete and correct application, AT&T-12STATE will provide to CLEC within 30
days a written estimate for the actual construction, labor, materials, and related provisioning costs
incurred to fulfill the SCA on a Time and Materials basis. When CLEC submits a request to provide
a written estimate for Lawful UNE Subloop access, appropriate rates for the engineering and other
associated costs performed will be charged.
9.12.4 The assignment of Lawful UNE Subloop facilities will incorporate reasonable practices used to
administer outside plant loop facilities. For example, where SAI/FDI interfaces are currently
administered in 25 pair cable complements, this will continue to be the practice in assigning and
administering Lawful UNE Subloop facilities.
9.12.5 Subloop inquiries do not serve to reserve Lawful UNE Subloops.
9.12.6 Several options exist for Collocation or Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangements at technically
feasible points. Sound engineering judgment will be utilized to ensure network security and
integrity. Each situation will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.
9.12.7 CLEC will be responsible for obtaining rights of way from owners of property where AT&T-
12STATE has placed the equipment necessary for the SAA prior to submitting the request for SCA.

062907
9.12.8 Prior to submitting the Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement Application for SCA, the CLEC
should have the “Collocation” and “Poles, Conduit, and Row” appendices in the Agreement to
provide the guidelines for both CLEC and ILEC to successfully implement Lawful UNE Subloops,
should collocation, access to poles/conduits or rights of way be required.
9.12.9 Except as set forth below in this 9.12.9, construction of the Lawful UNE Subloop Access
Arrangement shall be completed within 90 days of CLEC submitting to AT&T-12STATE written
approval and payment of not less than 50% of the total estimated construction costs and related
provisioning costs after an estimate has been accepted by the carrier and before construction
begins, with the balance payable upon completion. AT&T-12STATE will not begin any construction
under the SCA until the CLEC has provided proof that it has obtained necessary rights of way as
defined in Section 9.12.7. In the event CLEC disputes the estimate for an SAA in accordance with
the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Agreement, AT&T-12STATE will proceed with
construction of the SAA upon receipt from CLEC of notice of the dispute and not less than fifty
percent (50%) of the total estimated costs, with the balance payable by CLEC upon completion of
the SAA. Such payments may be subject to any “true-up”, if applicable, upon resolution of the
dispute in accordance with the Dispute Resolution procedures.
9.12.10 Upon completion of the construction activity, the CLEC will be allowed to test the installation with a
AT&T-12STATE technician. If the CLEC desires test access to the SAA, the CLEC should place
its own test point in its cable prior to cable entry into AT&T-12STATE’s interconnection point.
9.12.11 A non-binding CLEC forecast shall be required as a part of the request for SAA. This will allow
AT&T-12STATE to properly engineer access to each SAI and to ensure AT&T-12STATE does not
provide more available terminations than the CLEC expects to use.
9.12.12 In order to maximize the availability of terminations for all CLECs, the CLEC shall provide CFA for
their Lawful UNE Subloop pairs utilizing the same 25-pair binder group. The CLEC would begin
utilizing the second 25-pair binder group once the first 25-pair binder group reached its capacity.
9.12.13 Unused CLEC terminations (in normal splicing increments such as 25-pair at a SAI/FDI) which
remain unused for a period of one year after the completion of construction shall be subject to
removal at CLEC expense.
9.12.14 In the event a CLEC elects to discontinue use of an existing SAA, or abandons such arrangement,
CLEC shall pay AT&T-12STATE for removal of their facilities from the SAA.
9.13 Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement (SAA) Access Points
9.13.1 SAI/FDI, ECS, SPOI, or Terminal
9.13.1.1 CLEC cable to be terminated in a AT&T-12STATE SAI/FDI, or Terminal, shall consist of
22 or 24-guage copper twisted pair cable bonded and grounded to the power company
Multi Grounded Neutral (MGN). Cable may be filled if buried or buried to aerial riser
cable. CLEC’s Aerial cables should be aircore.
9.13.1.2 The CLEC may elect to place their cable to within 3 feet of the SAA site and coil up an
amount of cable, defined by the engineer in the design phase, that AT&T-12STATE will
terminate on available binding posts in the SAI/FDI or Terminal.
9.13.1.3 The CLEC may “stub” up a cable at a prearranged meet point, defined during the
engineering site visit, and AT&T-12STATE will stub out a cable from the SAI/FDI or
Terminal, which AT&T-12STATE will splice to the CLEC cable at the meet point.
9.13.1.4 Dead counts will be offered as long as they have not been placed for expansion purposes
planned within the 12-month period beginning on the date of the inquiry LSR.

9.14 Relocation of Existing ILEC/CLEC Facilities Involved in a SAA at a RT/ECS, SAI/FDI, SPOI, Terminal or
NID
9 14.1 AT&T-12STATE shall notify CLEC of pending relocation as soon as AT&T-12STATE receives such
notice.
9 14.2 CLEC shall notify AT&T-12STATE of its intentions to remain, or not, in the SAA by way of a new
Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement Application for a new SCA.
9 14.3 AT&T-12STATE shall then provide the CLEC an estimate to terminate their facilities as part of the
relocation of the site including the applicable SAA. This process may require a site visit with the
CLEC and AT&T-12STATE engineer.
9.14.4 CLEC shall notify AT&T-12STATE of acceptance or rejection of the new SCA within 10 business
days of its receipt of AT&T-12STATE’s estimate.
9.14.5 Upon acceptance of the AT&T-12STATE estimate, CLEC shall pay at least 50% of the relocation
costs at the same time as they notify AT&T-12STATE of their acceptance of estimate costs.
9.14.6 Should CLEC decide not to continue the SAA, CLEC will notify AT&T-12STATE as to the date that
AT&T-12STATE may remove CLEC’s facilities from that SAA. CLEC will pay AT&T-12STATE for
all costs associated with the removal of the CLEC’s SAA.
9.14.7 In the event that CLEC does not respond to AT&T-12STATE in time to have their facilities relocated,
AT&T-12STATE shall move CLEC facilities and submit a bill for payment to the CLEC for the costs
associated with the relocation. Should CLEC elect not pay this bill, then CLEC facilities will be
removed from the site upon 30 days notice to the CLEC.
9.15 Establishment of Intermediary Box for CLEC Access to Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment
9.15.1 As an alternative to the establishment of a Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement in those
instances where CLEC wishes to access/lease AT&T-12STATE Term to NID Lawful UNE Subloop
segments in order to serve its End Users at MTEs in AT&T-12STATE (“Term to NID MTE Lawful
UNE Subloop Segments”), CLEC may place, own and manage, for its own use, an intermediary box,
which would provide CLEC with access to a Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment cross-
connect leased from AT&T-12STATE within the intermediary box (in order to obtain access to
AT&T-12STATE Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments). In the event CLEC wishes to
access AT&T-12STATE Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments via the establishment of
an intermediary box, the following rates, terms and conditions shall apply:
9.15.1.1 CLEC would manage the process for placing its own intermediary box, including, without
limitation, coordination with the property owner and/or management. CLEC may, at its
discretion, choose to retain ownership in whole or to share ownership of the intermediary
box with other CLECs. Intermediary box shall be placed no more than two feet from the
AT&T terminal.
9.15.1.2 The intermediary box shall contain blocks that meet AT&T-12STATE’s published industry
standards for the placement of services and facilities and should be labeled with CLEC’s
ACNA to enable the AT&T-12STATE technician the ability to run jumper/cross connect
from AT&T-12STATE terminal to the intermediary box.
9.15.1.3 LEC agrees that the AT&T-12STATE technician shall run the jumper/cross-connect from
AT&T-12STATE’s serving terminal to CLEC’s intermediary box, in order for CLEC to
access AT&T-12STATE Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments in AT&T-
12STATE. For security and safety, AT&T will incase the cross connect in conduit, a
protective covered common path, between the AT&T terminal and the CLEC’s intermediary
box.
9.15.1.4 CLEC must have in place Connecting Facility Arrangement (CFA) assignments prior to
ordering and assigning specific Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments from
AT&T-12STATE.

9.15.1.5 Following CLEC’s provisioning, placement, and completion of Connecting Facility
Arrangement Assignments (“CFA“) data submission to AT&T-12STATE associated with
the intermediary box, CLEC would place orders and schedule activities related to access to
the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment including, without limitation:
transferring the End User’s service from AT&T-12STATE to CLEC, providing AT&T-
12STATE with CFA prior to ordering and the assigning of a specific Term to NID MTE
Lawful UNE Subloop Segment(s).
9.15.1.6 The ordering procedures for the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment will be
the same as those that apply to Lawful UNE Subloop today and shall be submitted to
AT&T-12STATE by CLEC via a Local Service Request (“LSR”).
9.15.1.7 AT&T-12STATE will upon receipt of the LSR from CLEC for a Term to NID MTE Lawful
UNE Subloop Segment, process the order and place the jumper/cross connect to the CFA
provided by the CLEC on the LSR, from the AT&T-12STATE terminal to the CLEC
intermediary box. AT&T-12STATE must have access to the intermediary box for
completion of the order.
9.15.2 In connection with the MTE intermediary box for CLEC access to Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE
Subloop Segments in AT&T-12STATE only, CLEC may elect to lease from AT&T-12STATE Term to
NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments which do not include traditional testing and the associated
labor, at the recurring and non-recurring rates set forth in Appendix Pricing for the “Term to NID MTE
Lawful UNE Subloop Segment.” In the event CLEC wishes to lease the Term to NID MTE Lawful
UNE Subloop Segment from AT&T-12STATE in lieu of AT&T-12STATE’s standard Term to NID
Lawful UNE Subloop segment addressed in this 9.15.2, CLEC understands and agrees no
performance measures and/or remedies shall apply to the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop
Segment as a result of the elimination of associated testing and reduction in functionality associated
with the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment.
9.16 Establishment of Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment When No Intermediary Box is Installed
9.16.1 In those instances where CLEC elects not to install an intermediary box or to have AT&T-12STATE
install an intermediary box pursuant to the SAA process outlined herein above, the CLEC may still
lease from AT&T-12STATE Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segments which do not include
traditional testing and the associated labor, at the recurring and non-recurring rates set forth in
Appendix Pricing for the “Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment”. In the event CLEC
wishes to lease the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment from AT&T-12STATE in lieu of
AT&T-12STATE’s standard Term to NID Lawful UNE Subloop segment addressed in Section 9.15.2
above, CLEC understands and agrees no performance measures and/or remedies shall apply to the
Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment as a result of the elimination of associated testing
and reduction in functionality associated with the Term to NID MTE Lawful UNE Subloop Segment.
In such cases, AT&T-12STATE will provide CLEC with access to the Term To NID MTE Lawful UNE
Subloop via a cross connect. The AT&T technician will tag appropriately and will leave up to two
feet of exposed wire at AT&T-12STATE’s terminal. The cross connect would then be terminated by
the CLEC technician in the CLEC terminal, at a time of CLEC’s own choosing. For security and
safety, AT&T will incase the cross connect in conduit, a protective covered common path, between
the AT&T terminal and the CLEC’s terminal.
9.16.2 If CLEC elects this option to obtain access to the Term To NID Lawful UNE Subloop in an MTE
Environment, neither the AT&T-12STATE SAA process nor the intermediary box option would be
required. Because the CLEC would have full responsibility for terminating the AT&T-12STATE
cross- connect, AT&T-12STATE could not require any CFA information from CLEC.
10. ENGINEERING CONTROLLED SPLICE (ECS)
10.1 Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Appendix, AT&T-12STATE shall provide to Engineering
controlled Splice under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
Page 339 of 551

APPENDIX LAWFUL UNES (Post-TRRO)/AT&T-13STATE

062907
10.2 AT&T-12STATE will also make available an Engineering Controlled Splice (ECS), which will be owned by
AT&T-12STATE, for CLECs to gain access to Lawful UNE Subloops at or near remote terminals.
10.3 The ECS shall be made available for Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangements (SAA) utilizing the Special
Construction Arrangement (SCA).
10.3.1 CLEC requesting such a SCA shall pay all of the actual construction, labor, materials and related
provisioning costs incurred to fulfill its SCA on a Time and Materials basis, provided that AT&T-
12STATE will construct any Lawful UNE Subloop Access Arrangement requested by a
Telecommunications Carrier in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If AT&T-12STATE elects to
incur additional costs for its own operating efficiencies and that are not necessary to satisfy an SCA
in a cost-effective and efficient manner, CLEC will not be liable for such extra costs.
10.3.2 CLEC shall be liable only for costs associated with cable pairs that it orders to be presented at an
engineering controlled splice (regardless of whether the requesting carrier actually utilizes all such
pairs), even if AT&T-12STATE places more pairs at the splice.
10.3.3 Although AT&T-12STATE will construct the engineering controlled splice, the ECS maybe owned by
AT&T-12STATE or the CLEC (depending on the specific arrangement) at the option of AT&T-
12STATE.
10.3.4 If more than one requesting Telecommunications Carrier obtains space in expanded remote
terminals or adjacent structures and obtains an SAA with the new copper interface point at the ECS,
the initial Telecommunications Carrier which incurred the costs of construction of the engineering
controlled splice and/or additional copper/fiber shall be reimbursed those costs in equal proportion to
the space or lines used by the requesting carriers.
10.3.5 AT&T-12STATE may require a separate SCA for each remote terminal site.
10.3.6 Except as set forth below in this Section 10.3.6, written acceptance and at least 50% of payment for
the SCA must be submitted at least 90 days before access to the copper Lawful UNE Subloop is to
be provisioned by AT&T-12STATE. If an augment of cabling is required between the ECS and the
SAI, the interval for completion of the SCA will be determined on an individual case basis. AT&T-
12STATE will not begin any construction of the ECS until the CLEC has provided proof that it has
obtained the necessary rights of way as defined in Section 9.12.7. In the event CLEC disputes the
estimate for the ECS in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this
Agreement, AT&T-12STATE will proceed with construction of the ECS upon receipt from CLEC of
notice of the dispute and not less than fifty percent (50%) of the total estimated costs, with the
balance payable by CLEC upon completion of the ECS. Such payments may be subject to any
“true-up”, if applicable, upon resolution of the dispute in accordance with the Dispute Resolution
procedures.
10.4 CLECs will have two (2) options for implementing the ECS: a “Dedicated Facility Option” (DFO) and a
“Cross-connected Facility Option” (CFO).
10.4.1 Dedicated Facility Option (DFO)
10.4.1.1 CLEC may request AT&T-12STATE splice the existing cabling between the ECS and the
SAI to the CLEC’s SAA facility. This facility will be “dedicated” to the CLEC for subsequent
Lawful UNE Subloop orders.
10.4.1.2 CLEC must designate the quantity of Lawful UNE Subloops they desire to access via this
spliced, dedicated facility, specified by subtending SAI.
10.4.1.3 CLECs will compensate AT&T-12STATE for each of the dedicated Lawful UNE Subloop
facilities, based on recurring Lawful UNE Subloop charges, for the quantity of Lawful UNE
Subloops dedicated to the CLEC between the ECS and the SAI.

10.4.2 Cross-connected Facility Option (CFO)
10.4.2.1 CLEC may request AT&T-12STATE build an ECS cross-connect junction on which to
terminate CLEC’s SAA facility.
10.4.2.2 The SCA associated with this option will include the charges associated with constructing
the cross-connect device, including the termination of AT&T-12STATE cabling between the
ECS and the RT and/or SAI, and the inventorying of that AT&T-12STATE cabling.
10.4.2.3 CLEC must designate the quantity of Lawful UNE Subloops they desire to access via this
cross-connectable, dedicated facility, specified by subtending SAI.
10.4.2.4 CLECs will compensate AT&T-12STATE for the charges incurred by AT&T-12STATE
derived from the CLEC’s request for the SCA.
10.5 The introduction of an ECS creates the following additional copper Lawful UNE Subloop segments:

12. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE
13. DS1 AND DS3 DEDICATED TRANSPORT
13.1 Subject to Section 2 of this Appendix Lawful UNEs, AT&T-13STATE shall provide Lawful UNE DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
13.2 For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:
13.2.1 “Dedicated Transport” is defined as AT&T-13STATE interoffice transmission facilities between wire
centers or switches owned by AT&T-13STATE, or between wire centers or switches owned by
AT&T-13STATE and switches owned by requesting telecommunications carriers, dedicated to a
particular customer or carrier.
13.2.1.1 AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access to Dedicated
Transport that does not connect a pair of AT&T-13STATE wire centers.
13.2.2 A “route” is defined as a transmission path between one of AT&T-13STATE’s wire centers or
switches and another of AT&T-13STATE’s wire centers or switches. A route between two points
(e.g., wire center of switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) may pass through one or more
intermediate wire centers or switches (e.g. wire center or switch “X”). Transmission paths between
identical end points (e.g., wire center or switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) are the same
“route,” irrespective of whether they pass through the same intermediate wire centers or switches, if
any.
13.3 AT&T-13STATE will be responsible for the engineering, provisioning, maintenance of the underlying
equipment and facilities that are used to provide Lawful UNE DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport.
13.3.1 Subject to the caps set forth in Sections 13.3.5 and 13.3.6, Lawful UNE DS1/DS3 Dedicated
Transport will be provided only where such facilities exist at the time of CLEC request, and only
over routes that are not or have not been Declassified.
13.3.2 Other than as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, AT&T CONNECTICUT does not
offer Lawful UNE DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport under this Agreement. Rather, it is available as
described in Section 18 of the Connecticut Access Service Tariff.
13.3.3 AT&T-13STATE will provide Lawful UNE DS1 and DS3 Transport to a requesting CLEC only at the
following speeds: DS1 (1.544 Mbps) and DS3 (44.736 Mbps).

062907
13.3.4 Lawful UNE DS1 and DS3 Transport includes, as follows:
13.3.4.1 Multiplexing – an option ordered in conjunction with Lawful UNE DS1 or DS3 Dedicated
Transport which converts a circuit from higher to lower bandwidth, or from digital to voice
grade. Multiplexing is only available when ordered at the same time as Lawful UNE DS1
or DS3 Dedicated Transport.
13.3.4.2 Other Optional features are outlined in Appendix Pricing.
13.3.5 DS3 Transport “Caps”
13.3.5.1 AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to provide to CLEC more than twelve(12) DS3 Lawful
UNE Dedicated Transport circuits on each route on which DS3 Dedicated Transport has
not been otherwise Declassified; accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain,
and CLEC will cease ordering unbundled DS3 Dedicated Transport once CLEC has
already obtained twelve DS3 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport circuits on the same route.
If, notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such an order, at AT&T-13STATE’s option
it may accept the order, but convert any requested DS3 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
in excess of the cap to Special Access, and applicable Special Access charges will apply
to CLEC for such DS3 Dedicated Transport circuits as of the date of provisioning.
13.3.6 DS1 Transport “Caps”
13.3.6.1 AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to provide to CLEC more than ten (10) DS1 Lawful UNE
Dedicated Transport circuits on each route on which DS1 Dedicated Transport has not
been otherwise Declassified; accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and
CLEC will cease ordering unbundled DS1 Dedicated Transport once CLEC has already
obtained ten DS1 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport circuits on the same route. If,
notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such an order, at AT&T-13STATE’s option it
may accept the order, but convert any requested DS1 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport in
excess of the cap to Special Access, and applicable Special Access charges will apply to
CLEC for such DS1 Dedicated Transport circuits as of the date of provisioning
13.4 Diversity
13.4.1 When requested by CLEC, and subject to all applicable terms, conditions, and applicable charges,
and only where such interoffice facilities exist at the time of CLEC request, Physical diversity shall
be provided for Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport. Physical diversity means that two circuits are
provisioned in such a way that no single failure of facilities or equipment will cause a failure on both
circuits.
13.4.2 AT&T-12STATE shall provide the Physical separation between intra-office and inter-office
transmission paths when technically and economically feasible. Physical diversity requested by the
CLEC shall be subject to additional charges. When additional costs are incurred by AT&T-
12STATE for CLEC specific diversity, AT&T-12STATE will advise CLEC of the applicable
additional charges. AT&T-12STATE will not process the request for diversity until CLEC accepts
such charges. Any applicable performance measures will be abated from the time diversity is
requested until CLEC accepts the additional charges.
13.5 Declassification Procedure
13.5.1 Wire Center “Tiers” -- For purposes of this Section 13.5 (and Section 14 related to Dark Fiber), wire
centers are classified into three “tiers,” as follows:
(i) Tier 1 Wire Centers are those ILEC wire centers that contain at least four fiber-based
collocators, at least 38,000 business lines, or both. Tier 1 Wire Centers also are those ILEC
tandem switching locations that have no line-side switching facilities, but nevertheless serve as
a point of traffic aggregation accessible by CLECs. Once a wire center is determined to be a
Tier 1 Wire Center, that wire center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 2 or Tier 3
Wire Center.

AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
(ii) Tier 2 Wire Centers are those ILEC wire centers that are not Tier 1 Wire Centers, but contain at
least 3 fiber-based collocators, at least 24,000 business lines, or both. Once a wire center is
determined to be a Tier 2 Wire Center, that Wire Center is not subject to later reclassification as
a Tier 3 Wire Center.
(iii) Tier 3 Wire Centers are those ILEC wire centers that do not meet the criteria for Tier 1 or Tier 2
Wire Centers.
13.5.2 DS1 Transport Declassification
13.5.2.1 Subject to the cap described in Section 13.3.6, AT&T-13STATE shall provide CLEC with
access to Lawful UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport on routes, except routes where both wire
centers defining the route are Tier 1 Wire Centers. As such AT&T-13STATE must
provide Lawful UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport under this Agreement only if a wire center
at either end of a requested route is not a Tier 1 Wire Center, or if neither is a Tier 1 Wire
Center. DS1 Dedicated Transport circuits on routes between Tier 1 Wire Centers are
Declassified and no longer available as Lawful UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly,
CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering DS1 Lawful UNE
Dedicated Transport on such route(s).
13.5.3 DS3 Transport Declassification
13.5.3.1 Subject to the cap described in Section 13.3.5, AT&T-13STATE shall provide CLEC with
access to Lawful UNE DS3 Dedicated Transport, except on routes where both wire
centers defining the route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers. As such AT&T-
13STATE must provide Lawful UNE DS3 Dedicated Transport under this Agreement only
if a wire center on either end of the requested route is a Tier 3 Wire Center. If both wire
centers defining a requested route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, then DS3
Dedicated Transport circuits on such routes are Declassified and no longer available as
Lawful UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise
obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering DS3 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport on such
route(s).
13.5.4 Effect on Embedded Base. Upon Declassification of DS1 Dedicated Transport or DS3 Dedicated
Transport already purchased by CLEC as Lawful UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE will
provide written notice to CLEC of such Declassification, and proceed in accordance with Section
2.5.
13.5.5 Products provided by AT&T-13STATE in conjunction with Lawful UNE DS1 or DS3 Dedicated
Transport (e.g. Cross-Connects) shall also be subject to re-pricing under this Section and Section
2.5 where such Transport is Declassified.
13.6 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-13STATE under this Section 13.5 shall not be subject to the
Network Disclosure Rules.
13.7 Routine Network Modifications – Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
13.7.1 AT&T-13STATE shall make routine network modifications to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
facilities used by requesting telecommunications carriers where the requested Lawful UNE
Dedicated Transport facilities have already been constructed. AT&T-13STATE shall perform
routine network modifications to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport facilities in a nondiscriminatory
fashion, without regard to whether the Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport facility being accessed was
constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
13.7.2 A routine network modification is an activity that AT&T-13STATE regularly undertakes for its own
customers. Routine network modifications include rearranging or splicing of cable and deploying a
multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer. Routine network modifications may entail
activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable. Routine
network modifications do not include the installation of new aerial or buried cable for a requesting

telecommunications carrier, and AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to perform those activities for a
requesting telecommunications carrier.
13.7.3 Routine network modifications do not include constructing new Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport;
installing new cable; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new manholes
or conduits; or installing new terminals. AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to perform those activities
for a requesting telecommunications carrier.
13.7.4 AT&T-13STATE shall determine whether and how to perform routine network modifications using
the same network or outside plant engineering principles that would be applied in providing service
to AT&T-13STATE’s retail customers.
13.7.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-13STATE’s obligations with respect to
routine network modifications apply only where the dedicated transport transmission facilities are
subject to unbundling.
13.7.6 AT&T-12STATE shall provide routine network modifications at the rates, terms and conditions set
out in this Appendix (AT&T-12STATE), and in the state specific Appendix Pricing (AT&T-
12STATE) or by tariff, as such tariff may be modified from time to time (AT&T CONNECTICUT).
AT&T-13STATE will impose charges for Routine Network Modifications in instances where such
charges are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and
non-recurring charges. The Parties agree that the routine network modifications for which AT&T-
12STATE is not recovering costs in existing recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which
costs will be imposed on CLEC on an ICB basis for all AT&T-12STATE include, but are not limited
to,: (i) splicing and (ii) in AT&T CALIFORNIA only, deploying of multiplexing equipment, to the
extent such equipment is not present on the loop or transport facility when ordered. The resulting
ICB rates shall continue to apply to such routine network modifications unless and until the Parties
negotiate specific rates based upon actual time and materials costs for such routine network
modifications through applicable state commission proceedings.
14. DARK FIBER DEDICATED TRANSPORT
14.1 Subject to Section 2 of this Appendix Lawful UNEs, AT&T-12STATE shall provide Lawful UNE Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber under the following terms and conditions in this subsection. AT&T-13STATE is not
required to provide Loop and/or Subloop Dark Fiber on an unbundled basis.
14.2 In AT&T-12STATE, Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is deployed, unlit optical fiber within AT&T-12STATE’s
network. Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber consists of unactivated optical interoffice transmission facilities.
Other than as specifically set out elsewhere in this Agreement, AT&T CONNECTICUT does not offer
dedicated transport dark fiber under this Agreement; rather, unbundled dedicated transport dark fiber is
available to CLECs as described in Section 18.2.1N of the Connecticut Service Tariff.
14.3 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
14.3.1 At dedicated transport dark fiber segments in routes that have not been Declassified, AT&T-
12STATE will provide a Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber segment that is considered
“spare” as defined in Sections 14.6 and 14.7 below. Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is
defined as AT&T-12STATE dark fiber interoffice transmission facilities dedicated to a particular
CLEC that are within AT&T-12STATE’s network, connecting AT&T-12STATE switches or wire
centers within a LATA. AT&T-12STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access
to Dedicated Transport that does not connect a pair of AT&T-12STATE wire centers. AT&T-
12STATE will offer Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber to CLEC when CLEC has
collocation space in each AT&T-12STATE CO where the requested Lawful UNE Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber(s) terminate.
14.4 A “route” is defined as a transmission path between one of AT&T-12STATE’s wire centers or switches and
another of AT&T-12STATE’s wire centers or switches. A route between two points (e.g., wire center of
switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) may pass through one or more intermediate wire centers or

switches (e.g. wire center or switch “X”). Transmission paths between identical end points (e.g., wire center
or switch “A” and wire center or switch “Z”) are the same “route,” irrespective of whether they pass through
the same intermediate wire centers or switches, if any.
14.5 Spare Fiber Inventory Availability and Condition
14.5.1 All available spare Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber will be provided as is. No
conditioning will be offered. Spare dedicated transport dark fiber is fiber that can be spliced in all
segments, point to point but not assigned, and spare dedicated transport dark fiber does not
include maintenance spares, fibers set aside and documented for AT&T-12STATE’s forecasted
growth, defective fibers, or fibers subscribed to by other Telecommunications Carriers. CLEC will
not obtain any more than 25% of the spare Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber contained
in the requested segment during any two-year period.
14.6 Determining Spare Fibers
14.6.1 AT&T-12STATE will inventory dedicated transport dark fiber. Spare dedicated transport dark fiber
does not include the following:
14.6.1.1 Maintenance spares. Maintenance spares shall be kept in inventory like a working fiber.
Spare maintenance fibers are assigned as follows:
14.6.1.1.1 Cables with 24 fibers and less: two maintenance spare fibers
14.6.1.1.2 Cables with 36 and 48 fibers: four maintenance spare fibers
14.6.1.1.3 Cables with 72 and 96 fibers: eight maintenance spare fibers
14.6.1.1.4 Cables with 144 fibers: twelve maintenance spare fibers
14.6.1.1.5 Cables with 216 fibers: 18 maintenance spares
14.6.1.1.6 Cables with 288 fibers: 24 maintenance spares
14.6.1.1.7 Cables with 432 fibers: 36 maintenance spares
14.6.1.1.8 Cables with 864 fibers: 72 maintenance spares
14.6.1.2 Defective fibers. Defective fibers, if any, will be deducted from the total number of spare
dedicated transport dark fiber that would otherwise be available.
14.6.1.3 AT&T-12STATE growth fibers. Fibers documented as reserved by AT&T-12STATE for
utilization for growth within the 12 month–period following the carrier’s request.
14.6.2 The appropriate AT&T-12STATE engineering organization will maintain records on each fiber optic
cable for which CLECs request Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber.
14.7 Quantities and Time Frames for Ordering Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
14.7.1 The minimum number of Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber strands that CLEC can order
is one, and such strands must be ordered on a strand-by-strand basis. The maximum number of
such strands that CLEC can order is no greater than 25% of the spare dedicated transport dark
fiber in the segment requested. Should spare dedicated transport dark fiber fall below 8 strands in
a given location, AT&T-12STATE will provide no more than a quantity of 2 strands. (See definition
of spare set forth in Section 14.6 above.)
14.7.2 If CLEC wishes to request Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, it must submit a dark fiber
facility inquiry, providing CLEC’s specific point to point (A to Z) dark fiber requirements. When
CLEC submits a dark fiber facility inquiry appropriate rates for the inquiry will be charged as
outlined in state specific Appendix Pricing.
14.7.2.1 If spare Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is available, as determined under
this Agreement, AT&T-12STATE will notify CLEC and CLEC may place an Access
Service Request (ASR) for such fiber.
14.7.3 Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber will be assigned to CLEC only when an ASR is
processed. ASRs will be processed on a first-come-first-served basis. Inquiry facility checks do

not serve to reserve Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber. When CLEC submits the ASR,
the ASR will be processed and the Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber facilities will be
assigned. The charges which will be established as set forth in Appendix Pricing will be applied.
14.8 Right of Revocation of Access to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
14.8.1 Right of revocation of access to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is distinguishable from
Declassification as defined in Section 5 of this Appendix. For clarification purposes, AT&T-
12STATE’s right of revocation of access under this Section 14.9 applies even when the affected
dedicated transport dark fiber remains a Lawful UNE, subject to unbundling obligations under
Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, in which case CLEC's rights to the affected network element may be
revoked as provided in this Section 14.8.
14.8.2 Should CLEC not utilize the fiber strand(s) subscribed to within the 12-month period following the
date AT&T-12STATE provided the fiber(s), AT&T-12STATE may revoke CLEC’s access to the
Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber and recover those fiber facilities and return them to
AT&T-12STATE inventory.
14.8.3 AT&T-12STATE may reclaim from the CLEC the right to use Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
Dark Fiber, whether or not such fiber is being utilized by CLEC, upon twelve (12) months written
notice to the CLEC. If the reclaimed Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is not otherwise
Declassified during the notice period, AT&T-12STATE will provide an alternative facility for the
CLEC with the same bandwidth the CLEC was using prior to reclaiming the facility. AT&T-
12STATE must also demonstrate to the CLEC that the reclaimed dedicated transport dark fiber will
be needed to meet AT&T-12STATE’s bandwidth requirements within the 12 months following the
revocation.
14.9 Access Methods Specific to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
14.9.1 The termination point for Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber at Central Offices will be in
an AT&T-12STATE approved splitter shelf. This arrangement allows for non-intrusive testing.
14.9.2 At CO’s, Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber terminates on a fiber distribution frame, or
equivalent in the CO. CLEC access is provided via collocation.
14.10 Installation and Maintenance for Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
14.10.1 AT&T-12STATE will install termination points and place the fiber jumpers from the fiber optic
terminals to the termination point. CLEC will run its fiber jumpers from the termination point (1x2,
90-10 optical splitter) to the CLEC.
14.11 Dark Fiber Transport Declassification
14.11.1 AT&T-13STATE shall provide CLEC with access to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber,
except on routes where both wire centers defining the route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers.
As such AT&T-13STATE must provide Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber under this
Agreement only if a wire center on either end of the requested route is a Tier 3 Wire Center. If both
wire centers defining a requested route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, then Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber circuits on such routes are Declassified and no longer available as Lawful
UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will
cease ordering Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber on such route(s).
14.11.2 Effect on Embedded Base. Upon Declassification of Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber already
purchased by CLEC as Lawful UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-13STATE will provide written
notice to CLEC of such Declassification, and proceed in accordance with Section 2.5 and at the
end of the notice period under that Section, provision of the affected dedicated transport dark fiber
to CLEC will be terminated without further obligation of AT&T-12STATE.
14.11.3 Products provided by AT&T-12STATE in conjunction with Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark
Fiber, if any, shall also be subject to termination under this Section 14.11 where such fiber is
Declassified.

14.11.4 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-12STATE under this Section 14.11 shall not be subject to
the Network Disclosure Rules.
14.12 Routine Network Modifications
14.12.1 AT&T-12STATE shall make routine network modifications to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
Dark Fiber used by requesting Telecommunications Carriers for the provision of
Telecommunication Services where the requested Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
facilities have already been constructed. AT&T-12STATE shall perform routine network
modifications to Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without
regard to whether such fiber being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the
specifications, of any Telecommunications Carrier.
14.12.2 A routine network modification is an activity that AT&T-12STATE regularly undertakes for its own
customers. Routine network modifications do not include the installation of fiber for a requesting
Telecommunications Carrier, nor do routine network modifications include the provision of
electronics for the purpose of lighting dark fiber (i.e., optronics), and AT&T-12STATE is not
obligated to perform those activities for a requesting Telecommunications Carrier.
14.12.3 Routine network modifications do not include constructing new Lawful UNE Dedicated Transport
Dark Fiber; installing new cable; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new
manholes or conduits; or installing new terminals. AT&T-13STATE is not obligated to perform
those activities for a requesting telecommunications carrier.
14.12.4 AT&T-13STATE shall determine whether and how to perform routine network modifications using
the same network or outside plant engineering principles that would be applied in providing service
to AT&T-13STATE’s retail customers.
14.12.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-13STATE’s obligations with respect to
routine network modifications apply only where the dark fiber transport transmission facilities are
subject to unbundling.
14.12.6 AT&T-12STATE shall provide routine network modifications at the rates, terms and conditions set
out in this Appendix (AT&T-12STATE), and in the state specific Appendix Pricing (AT&T-
12STATE) or by tariff, as such tariff may be modified from time to time (AT&T CONNECTICUT).
AT&T-12STATE will impose charges for Routine Network Modifications in instances where such
charges are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and
non-recurring charges. The Parties agree that the routine network modifications for which AT&T-
12STATE is not recovering costs in existing recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which
costs will be imposed on CLEC on an ICB basis for all AT&T-12STATE’s include: dark fiber
transport splicing. The resulting ICB rates shall continue to apply to such routine network
modifications unless and until the Parties negotiate specific rates based upon actual time and
materials costs for such routine network modifications or specific rates are otherwise established
for such routine network modifications through applicable state commission proceedings.
15. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE

18. CROSS CONNECTS
18.1 AT&T-13STATE shall provide Cross Connects under this Appendix only for purposes of permitting CLEC to
access AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE(s), to connect a Lawful UNE to another Lawful UNE, to Commingle
(as provided for in this Agreement), or as may otherwise be used with respect to Lawful UNEs in
accordance with this Agreement. AT&T-13STATE shall provide Cross Connects under the following terms
and conditions in this subsection. AT&T-13STATE shall only be obligated to provide Cross Connects
under this Appendix for purposes of permitting CLEC to connect AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE(s) to other
Lawful UNE(s) or to CLEC’s own facilities.
18.2 A “Cross Connect” is the media used as described in Section 18.1. This includes, for example, the media
between a AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE and the point of access associated with an Interconnection Cable
Arrangement to CLEC’s Collocation arrangement, and the media between one AT&T-13STATE Lawful
UNE and another AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE where AT&T-13STATE has connected or left connected
those Lawful UNEs. Nothing in this Section 18 is a commitment to connect or leave connected any two or
more Lawful UNEs.
18.3 AT&T-12STATE will provide the Cross Connects at the rates, terms, and conditions set forth in applicable
pricing appendix and/or pricing schedule. For all cross-connect pricing for AT&T CONNECTICUT, refer to
the applicable state tariff.
19. PROVISIONING/MAINTENANCE OF LAWFUL UNES
19.1 Access to Lawful UNEs is provided under this Agreement over such routes, technologies, and facilities as
AT&T-13STATE may elect at its own discretion. AT&T-13STATE will provide access to Lawful UNEs
where technically feasible. Where facilities and equipment are not available, AT&T-13STATE shall not be
required to provide Lawful UNEs. Collocation is available from AT&T-13STATE for obtaining access to
Lawful UNEs. See collocation appendices. CLEC may request, through the Bona Fide Request (BFR)
process, and, to the extent required by law, AT&T-13STATE may agree to provide an alternative,
technically feasible method(s) of accessing Lawful UNEs.
19.2 Subject to the terms herein, AT&T-13STATE is responsible only for the installation, operation and
maintenance of the Lawful UNEs it provides. AT&T-13STATE is not otherwise responsible for the
Telecommunications Services provided by CLEC through the use of those Lawful UNEs.
19.3 Where Lawful UNEs provided to CLEC are dedicated to a single End User, if such Lawful UNEs are for any
reason disconnected they shall be made available to AT&T-13STATE for future provisioning needs, unless
such Lawful UNE is disconnected in error. The CLEC agrees to relinquish control of any such Lawful UNE
concurrent with the disconnection of a CLEC’s End User’s service.
19.4 CLEC shall make available at mutually agreeable times the Lawful UNEs provided pursuant to this
Appendix in order to permit AT&T-13STATE to test and make adjustments appropriate for maintaining the
Lawful UNEs in satisfactory operating condition. No credit will be allowed for any interruptions involved
during such testing and adjustments.
19.5 CLEC’s use of any AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE, or of its own equipment or facilities in conjunction with
any AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNE, will not materially interfere with or impair service over any facilities of
AT&T-13STATE, its affiliated companies or its connecting and concurring carriers involved in its services,
cause damage to their plant, impair the privacy of any communications carried over their facilities or create
hazards to the employees of any of them or the public. Upon reasonable written notice and opportunity to
cure, AT&T-13STATE may discontinue or refuse service if CLEC violates this provision, provided that such
termination of service will be limited to CLEC’s use of the Lawful UNE(s) causing the violation.
19.6 When a AT&T-13STATE provided tariffed or resold service is replaced by CLEC’s facility-based service
using any AT&T-13STATE provided Lawful UNE(s), CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests, to both
disconnect the existing service and order Lawful UNEs. These requests will be processed by AT&T-
13STATE, and CLEC will be charged the applicable Lawful UNE service order charge(s), in addition to the
recurring and nonrecurring charges for each individual Lawful UNE and cross connect ordered. Similarly,

PAGE 45 OF 46
AT&T-13STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
when an End User is served by one CLEC using AT&T-13STATE provided Lawful UNEs is converted to a
different CLEC’s service which also uses any AT&T-13STATE provided Lawful UNE, the requesting CLEC
shall issue appropriate service requests to both disconnect the existing service and connect new service to
the requesting CLEC’s End User. These requests will be processed by AT&T-13STATE and the CLEC will
be charged the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for
each individual Lawful UNE and cross connect ordered.
19.7 CLEC shall connect equipment and facilities that are compatible with the AT&T-13STATE Lawful UNEs,
and shall use Lawful UNEs in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and requirements
referenced in this Agreement.
19.8 CLEC shall not combine or use Lawful UNEs in a manner that will undermine the ability of other
Telecommunications Carriers to obtain access to lawful unbundled network elements or to Interconnect with
AT&T-13STATE’s network.
19.8.1 AT&T-13STATE shall charge the CLEC a Maintenance of Service Charge (MSC) when CLEC
reports a suspected failure of a Lawful UNE and AT&T-13STATE dispatches personnel to the End
User's premises or an AT&T-13STATE Central Office and trouble was not caused by AT&T-
13STATE's facilities or equipment. Time and materials will include all technicians dispatched,
including technicians dispatched to other locations for purposes of testing.
19.9 CLEC shall pay Time and Material charges when AT&T-13STATE dispatches personnel and the trouble is
in equipment or communications systems provided an entity by other than AT&T-13STATE or in detariffed
CPE provided by AT&T-13STATE, unless covered under a separate maintenance agreement.
19.10 CLEC shall pay Maintenance of Service charges when the trouble clearance did not otherwise require
dispatch, but dispatch was requested for repair verification or cooperative testing, and the circuit did not
exceed maintenance limits.
19.11 If CLEC issues a trouble report allowing AT&T-13STATE access to End User's premises and AT&T-
13STATE personnel are dispatched but denied access to the premises, then Time and Material charges will
apply for the period of time that AT&T-13STATE personnel are dispatched. Subsequently, if AT&T-
13STATE personnel are allowed access to the premises, these charges will still apply.
19.12 Time and Material charges apply on a first and additional basis for each half-hour or fraction thereof. If
more than one technician is dispatched in conjunction with the same trouble report, the total time for all
technicians dispatched will be aggregated prior to the distribution of time between the "First Half Hour or
Fraction Thereof" and "Each Additional Half Hour or Fraction Thereof" rate categories. Basic Time is work-
related efforts of AT&T-13STATE performed during normally scheduled working hours on a normally
scheduled workday. Overtime is work-related efforts of AT&T-13STATE performed on a normally
scheduled workday, but outside of normally scheduled working hours. Premium Time is work related efforts
of AT&T-13STATE performed other than on a normally scheduled workday.
19.12.1 If CLEC requests or approves an AT&T-13STATE technician to perform services in excess of or
not otherwise contemplated by the nonrecurring charges herein, CLEC will pay Time and Material
charges for any additional work to perform such services, including requests for installation or other
work outside of normally scheduled working hours.
19.13 Maintenance of Elements
19.13.1 If trouble occurs with Lawful UNEs provided by AT&T-13STATE, CLEC will first determine whether
the trouble is in CLEC’s own equipment and/or facilities or those of the End User. If CLEC
determines the trouble is in AT&T-13STATE’s equipment and/or facilities, CLEC will issue a trouble
report to AT&T-13STATE.
19.13.2 CLEC shall pay Time and Material charges (maintenance of service charges/additional labor
charges) when CLEC reports a suspected failure of a Lawful UNE and AT&T-13STATE dispatches
personnel to the End User’s premises or an AT&T-13STATE Central Office and trouble was not

2.4 Subject to AT&T-13STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
White Pages directories, AT&T-13STATE will include in appropriate White Pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of all CLEC End Users located within the local directory scope. The rules, regulations
and AT&T-13STATE practices are subject to change from time to time. When CLEC provides its
subscriber listing information to AT&T-13STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End User, one
primary listing in AT&T-13STATE White Pages directory and a listing in AT&T-13STATE’s directory
assistance database.
2.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires foreign, enhanced or other listings in addition to the primary listing
to appear in the White Pages directory, AT&T-13STATE will assess CLEC a monthly charge for
such listings at AT&T-13STATE tariff rates. An additional monthly charge at AT&T-13STATE’s tariff

XDSL AND LINE SPLITTING APPENDIX
TO INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT
xDSL Loops and xDSL Subloops and Line Splitting: AT&T-12STATE will make available xDSL loops and xDSL
subloops for the provision of xDSL-based services, and xDSL loops for purposes of line splitting, in accordance with the
FCC’s Triennial Review Order and associated lawful and effective implementing rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(i)-(iv) and
(b)(1), as such rules may be modified from time to time.
1. General
1.1 Deployment of xDSL Technologies: AT&T-12STATE will provide xDSL loops and xDSL subloops for CLEC
to deploy xDSL technologies presumed acceptable for deployment or non-standard xDSL technologies as
defined in this Agreement and as provided for under the applicable lawful and effective FCC rules, 47 C.F.R.
§51.230, as such rule may be modified from time to time.
1.2 AT&T-12STATE will not guarantee that an xDSL loop or xDSL subloop ordered by CLEC will perform as desired
by CLEC for xDSL-based services, but will guarantee that loops will be provisioned to meet basic metallic loop
parameters, including continuity and pair balance. CLEC shall designate on its LSR, at CLEC’s sole option, what
loop conditioning AT&T-12STATE is to perform in provisioning the order.
2. Loop Makeup Information and Ordering: AT&T-12STATE will provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to its
loop makeup information set forth originally in AT&T-12STATE’s Advanced Service OSS Plan of Record via: (i) a
mechanized loop qualification for real-time access to data available electronically in AT&T-12STATE’s databases; or
(ii) manual loop qualification for information not available electronically (which will carry an interval of 3-5 business
days or the interval provided to AT&T-12STATE’s advanced services affiliate). CLEC will be given nondiscriminatory
access to the same loop makeup information that AT&T-12STATE is providing to any other CLEC, AT&T-
12STATE’s retail operations and/or its advanced services affiliate. AT&T-12STATE’s uniform GUI and application to
application OSS interfaces allow CLEC, AT&T-12STATE’s retail operations and/or its advanced services affiliate, to
have real time electronic access as a preordering function to the loop makeup information.
3. Provisioning Intervals: AT&T-12STATE’s provisioning intervals per order per end-user location shall be the
intervals set forth below or the associated interval applicable to AT&T-12STATE’s advanced services affiliate,
whichever is less.
3.1 Where no conditioning or outside plant rearrangements necessary:
3.1.1 xDSL Loops (i.e., 2-wire xDSL Loop, 4-wire xDSL Loop and IDSL Loop – collectively xDSL Loops): three
(3) business days. xDSL Subloops shall have the same provisioning interval as the xDSL Loops
following completion of the Subloop Access Arrangement (SAA).
3.1.2 With conditioning or outside plant rearrangements - xDSL Loops: ten (10) business days. xDSL Subloops
shall have the same provisioning interval following completion of the SAA.
4. Loop Conditioning
4.1 AT&T-12STATE will condition xDSL loops and xDSL subloops in accordance with the lawful and effective
requirements of 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(iii); provided, however: (i) If load coils, repeaters or Excessive Bridged
Tap are present on a loop less than 12,000 feet in actual loop length, conditioning to remove these elements will
be performed without request and at no charge to CLEC; (ii) if the loop qualification indicates conditioning is
available on a loop that is 12,000 feet in actual loop length or greater, CLEC may request that no conditioning be
performed or that AT&T-12STATE perform some or all of the available loop conditioning to remove Excessive
Bridged Tap, load coils and/or repeaters at the rates set forth in Appendix Pricing.
4.2 Removal of All or Non-Excessive Bridged Tap (“RABT”):
4.2.1 CLEC may request RABT conditioning via a trouble ticket after its service order for the xDSL Loop or
xDSL Subloop has been completed; provided, however, CLEC shall assist in trouble isolation for RABT-
related initial trouble tickets by obtaining and providing to AT&T-12STATE interferer information on the
Page 360 of 551

XDSL/LINE SPLITTING/AT&T-12STATE
PAGE 4 OF 6
AT&T-12STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
020106
loop at the time of opening the trouble ticket. CLEC should utilize its testing equipment to determine the
following: the number and location of load coil(s), repeater(s) and bridged tap(s), including the length of
individual sections. If an RABT trouble ticket is opened, and it is later determined by AT&T-12STATE
that the requested conditioning is not available because no such bridged tap was on the loop, the trouble
ticket will be closed as a ‘No Trouble Found’ (NTF) and CLEC shall pay the Maintenance of Service
charges referenced in Section 7.2 below.
4.2.2 CLEC may open an RABT trouble ticket via one of the following two methods: (i) by calling the LOC and
opening a manual ticket with its specific RABT conditioning request; or (ii) by opening an electronic
bonding ticket and in such case, shall identify its specific RABT conditioning request in the remarks field.
If the specific RABT conditioning request is not documented on the CLEC trouble ticket, the trouble ticket
will be returned to CLEC for specific information. Upon CLEC’s request, the LOC will also investigate
and address any AT&T-12STATE non-conditioning related reasons for any No Sync situation, or ensure
CLEC’s RABT request is appropriate by verifying the subject bridged tap is located on the loop, but
AT&T-12STATE does not guarantee the synchronization of any loop. AT&T-12STATE In either case,
when Excessive Bridged Tap is present on the loop, CLEC may request the removal of All Bridged Tap;
and when Excessive Bridged Tap is not present on the loop, the removal of Non-Excessive Bridged Tap.
If and when All Bridged Tap has been removed, any future trouble tickets concerning bridged tap will
require a vendor meet with the AT&T-12STATE LOC. AT&T-12STATE LOC will notify CLEC as soon as
the trouble is closed, whether conditioning has been performed or not. In those instances where AT&T-
12STATE removes All or Non-Excessive Bridged Tap upon receipt of an RABT trouble ticket from CLEC
under the provisions set forth herein, CLEC shall pay the applicable RABT conditioning charges set forth
in Appendix Pricing for such conditioning work.
4.2.3 A trouble ticket opened by CLEC for RABT conditioning will be assigned a zero plus five (0+ 5) business
day interval or in parity with the repair intervals AT&T-12STATE provides to its advanced services
affiliate. When AT&T-12STATE determines it is not possible to perform RABT e.g., in those situations in
which (i) municipalities will not grant rights of way to certain areas; or (ii) there are other issues
associated with access to the subject facilities; or (iii) events, actions or circumstances exist or arise that
are outside the sole control of AT&T-12STATE, AT&T-12STATE has no obligation to perform such
conditioning.
4.2.4 To the extent that CLEC would like the option to request that a loop be conditioned by AT&T-12STATE to
remove any device other than Excessive Bridged Taps, load coils and/or repeaters, or Non-excessive or
All Bridged Tap, to make a loop xDSL capable, the Parties shall first meet to negotiate rates, terms and
conditions for any such conditioning. In the event the loop over which the end-user is being provided
xDSL-based service should require conditioning during non-working hours, the due date may be adjusted
consistent with the end-user’s release of the voice grade circuit and the Maintenance of Service charges
referenced in Section 7.2 below shall apply for the time devoted by AT&T-12STATE to perform the
requested conditioning during non-working hours, in addition to the loop conditioning rates set forth in
Appendix Pricing for the actual loop conditioning work performed.
4.3 Maintenance, Repair and Testing: AT&T-12STATE shall provide Maintenance Repair and Testing in
accordance with the lawful and effective requirements of 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(iv).
4.3.1 Maintenance Scope: AT&T-12STATE’s maintenance shall be as follows: (i) for loops 12,000 feet or
less: AT&T-12STATE maintenance shall be limited to assuring loop continuity and balance and
verification that the loop was (or is) conditioned as described in Section 4.1 above; (ii) for loops greater
than 12,000 feet for which CLEC elected that AT&T-12STATE not perform any conditioning, AT&T-
12STATE maintenance shall be limited to assuring loop continuity and balance. For loops greater than
12,000 for which CLEC requested that AT&T-12STATE perform some or all of the available conditioning,
AT&T-12STATE will verify continuity, the completion of all requested conditioning and will repair at no
charge to CLEC any gross defects which would be unacceptable for POTS and which do not result from
the loop’s modified design. AT&T-12STATE will resolve CLEC-referred trouble tickets in parity with the
repair intervals AT&T-12STATE provides its advanced services affiliate.

AT&T-12STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC, NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
020106
4.3.2 CLEC Submitted Trouble Ticket: If CLEC submits a trouble ticket to AT&T-12STATE and the problem
is determined by AT&T-12STATE to be in CLEC’s network, data equipment or splitter, CLEC shall pay
AT&T-12STATE, following AT&T-12STATE closing the trouble ticket, the Maintenance of Service
charges referenced in Section 7.2 below. In any such case, when CLEC resolves the trouble condition in
its network, data equipment or splitter, CLEC will contact AT&T-12STATE to advise that the trouble has
been resolved.
4.3.3 Line and Station Transfer (“LST”): For a loop currently in service where trouble ticket resolution has
identified that Excessive Bridged Tap(s), load coil(s) and/or repeater(s) are on the loop and transferring to
a new loop is a solution identified by AT&T-12STATE to resolve a trouble, AT&T-12STATE, at its sole
option, may perform an LST to resolve the identified trouble. In the event that a request for conditioning
is received from the CLEC on a loop currently in service and AT&T-12STATE determines that an LST
can be performed, the AT&T-12STATE LOC will contact CLEC to inform it of the decision to perform an
LST in lieu of CLEC’s requested conditioning. In such case, the charge for the LST set forth in Appendix
Pricing shall apply in lieu of any loop conditioning charges which would have applied had the requested
conditioning been performed. If, however, the LST does not resolve the reported trouble and the trouble
is determined to be an AT&T-12STATE network-related problem, then CLEC will not be charged the LST
rate or for AT&T-12STATE’s resolution of the trouble. If, however, the trouble is found not to be an
AT&T-12STATE network-related problem, then CLEC shall pay the Maintenance of Service charges
referenced in Section 7.2 below, in addition to the applicable LST charge.
5. Spectrum Management: The Parties shall comply with the FCC’s lawful and effective spectrum management rules,
47 C.F.R. §51.231-233, as such rules may be modified from time to time. CLEC will advise AT&T-12STATE on the
ordering form of the Power Spectral Density (“PSD”) mask approved or proposed by T1.E1 that reflects the service
performance parameters of the technology that CLEC intends to provision, and CLEC will notify AT&T-12STATE if
and when a change in PSD mask is made. AT&T-12STATE shall use such PSD information solely for inventory and
spectrum management purposes and in all cases, will manage the spectrum and differing xDSL services in a
competitively neutral manner consistent with all relevant industry standards. AT&T-12STATE shall not deny CLEC a
loop based upon spectrum management issues in the absence of FCC or Commission approval. In the event that
the FCC or the industry establishes long-term standards, practices and policies relating to spectrum compatibility and
management that differ from those referenced in this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with such standards,
practices and policies and will establish a mutually agreeable transition plan and timeframe for implementation;
provided, however, if AT&T-12STATE and/or CLEC is providing xDSL technologies for which there was previously
no standard, then that Party must begin the process of bringing its deployed xDSL technology(ies) and equipment
into compliance with such standards at its own expense within thirty (30) days after general availability.
6. Splitters: CLEC shall own and have sole responsibility to forecast, purchase, install, inventory, provision and
maintain splitters for purposes of line splitting hereunder and shall collocate such splitters in accordance with the
collocation provisions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or as set forth in the applicable Commission-ordered
tariff, as applicable, and consistent with AT&T-12STATE’s standard collocation practices and procedures. With
respect to any CLEC physical collocation arrangement in which a CLEC splitter is located, CLEC will have test
access to the line side of its splitter (assuming CLEC has provisioned splitter cards that provide test port capabilities).
CLEC-owned splitters shall be provisioned using standard AT&T-12STATE configuration cabling and wiring in
AT&T-12STATE locations and shall adhere to established industry and national standards. CLEC’s Connecting
Block layouts will reflect standard recognizable arrangements that work in conjunction with AT&T-12STATE’s OSS.
7. Pricing/Rates
7.1 The rates applicable to xDSL Loops and xDSL Subloops and the associated charges including without limitation,
the applicable service order charges and charges for mechanized and manual loop qualification, loop
conditioning, cross-connects and LSTs are set forth in Appendix Pricing.
7.2 In those instances specified herein, or in the event that AT&T-12STATE agrees to perform any additional work
on CLEC’s behalf that is not explicitly addressed in this Appendix, CLEC shall pay Maintenance of Service
charges on a time and material basis, in 30-minute increments, for the AT&T-12STATE technician time involved

8.1 The Parties agree that processing of retroactive messages through the CH is acceptable, if such messages
utilize the industry standard format for call records, pursuant to Section III of this Attachment. The Parties
agree that lost messages are the complete responsibility of the originating LEC or CLEC. If messages are
lost by any Party, and cannot be recreated or retransmitted, the originating LEC or CLEC will estimate
messages, minutes, and associated revenues based on the best available data. No estimate will be made
for messages, which are more than two years old at the time the estimate is made. The estimates will be
off-line calculations (i.e., not part of the routine CH processing) and will be included as a supplement to the
monthly settlement report.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
9.1 By agreeing to operate the CH, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE assumes no liability for any LEC’s
or CLEC's receipt of appropriate revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that AT&T

damages caused by the sole negligence of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. Any losses or
damage for which AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE is held liable under this Attachment will in no
event exceed the amount of processing charges incurred by CLEC for the CH services provided hereunder
during the period beginning at the time AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE receives notice of the
error, interruption, defect, failure or malfunction, to the time service is restored.
10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

that CLEC is entitled to any particular manner of access, nor is it evidence that AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION
5-STATE is limited to providing any particular manner of access. The Parties’ rights and obligations to such
access are defined elsewhere, including the relevant laws, FCC and PUC decisions/regulations, tariffs, and
within this interconnection agreement.
1.5 Except as otherwise provided herein, the service performance measures most recently ordered by the State
Commission that approved this Agreement under Section 252(e) of the Act (The Performance Measurements
Plan) are incorporated herein. Any subsequently Commission-ordered additions, modifications and/or
deletions to such plan and its supporting documents, shall be incorporated into this Agreement by reference
and shall supersede and supplant all performance measurements previously agreed to by the Parties.
1.6 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE’s agreement to implement this Performance Measures Plan will not
be considered as an admission against interest or an admission of liability in any legal, regulatory, or other
proceeding relating to the same performance. AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE and CLEC agree that
CLEC may not use the existence of this Plan as evidence that AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has
discriminated in the provision of any facilities or services under Sections 251 or 252, or has violated any state
or federal law or regulation. AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE’s conduct underlying its performance
measures, and the performance data provided under the performance measures, however, are not made
inadmissible by these terms. Any CLEC accepting this performance plan agrees that AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE’s performance with respect to this plan may not be used as an admission of liability or
culpability for a violation of any state or federal law or regulation.
1.7 Enforcement measures through liquidated damages for failure to meet certain performance measures, set
referenced in this Attachment, are available via a stand alone Performance Remedy Plan.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Appendix sets forth the pricing terms and conditions only for the applicable AT&T Inc. (AT&T) owned
Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) identified in 1.3 below. The rate table included in this Appendix
is divided into the following five categories: Unbundled Network Elements (UNEs), Resale, Other (Resale),
Other and Reciprocal Compensation. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be
construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement,
including but not limited to the term “Lawful UNE,” as that term is defined and used in this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T Inc. (AT&T) means the holding company which directly or indirectly owns the following ILECs: Illinois
Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Illinois, Indiana Bell Telephone Company Incorporated d/b/a AT&T
Indiana, Michigan Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan, Nevada Bell Telephone Company d/b/a
AT&T Nevada, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Ohio, Pacific Bell Telephone Company
d/b/a AT&T California, The Southern New England Telephone Company, Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company d/b/a AT&T Arkansas, AT&T Kansas, AT&T Missouri, AT&T Oklahoma and/or AT&T Texas
and/or Wisconsin Bell, Inc. d/b/a AT&T Wisconsin.
1.3 AT&T ARKANSAS - As used herein, AT&T ARKANSAS means Southwestern Bell Telephone Company
d/b/a AT&T Arkansas, the applicable AT&T-owned ILEC doing business in Arkansas.
1.4 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
Certain of the non-interim rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established
by the Commission (“Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement
that are not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.4, or that are not marked as interim or
as “TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Non-Interim Rates. If, during
the Term of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable to the
Interconnection, Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, functions, facilities, Resale discounts, or
products or services (“Products or Services”) available under this Agreement (i.e. not an order or docket
relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration), either Party may provide
written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party, after the effective date of such order, that it
wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and
supersede the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) already set forth in this Agreement. Following
such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for any formal amendment or further
Commission action, the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the
Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3, below, and the
Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as provided in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3,
below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment which shall reflect that the
Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) were replaced by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such
Amendment to the state commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after
such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party any adjustments that are necessary to
reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the Parties as provided below:
1.4.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any
such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the effective
date of the order, and AT&T ARKANSAS will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g.,
billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified Rate(s)
with the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of the
order, in accordance herewith.

AT&T ARKANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC

1.4.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.4.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.4, but not within ninety
(90) days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment
effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or
otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s)
for any period prior to the effective date of such amendment.
1.4.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.4 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.4) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)
with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.4.
1.5 The Parties understand and agree that on May 9, 2003, the Public Utilities Act of Illinois was amended to
add Sections 13-408 and 13-409, 220 ILCS 5/13-408 and 13-409, and enacted into law ("Illinois Law"). The
Illinois Law establishes a specific method for setting certain UNE rates in Illinois, mandates that the Illinois
Commerce Commission (“ICC”) apply the method and determine the rates (“ICC Rates”), and expressly
deems all interconnection agreements to be amended to contain the ICC Rates immediately upon the ICC's
announcement of such adjusted rates, without further action. The Parties understand and agree that the
rates in the attached Pricing Schedule are based upon AT&T Illinois’ obligations under FCC rules and
regulations, and applicable ICC orders as they existed prior to the ICC’s promulgation of rates, terms and
conditions pursuant to the Illinois Law. The Parties understand and agree that the ICC Rates shall
automatically apply to this Agreement, and shall replace and supersede any corresponding rates currently
contained in this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) as of the effective date of any such ICC order(s)
upon the written request of either Party (“Written Notice”). As soon as practical following the Written Notice,
AT&T Illinois shall begin billing CLEC the ICC Rates; provided, however, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that no later than sixty (60) days from the Written Notice, the Parties will execute a conforming
Amendment to this Agreement so that the Agreement accurately reflects the ICC Rates, and AT&T Illinois
will issue any adjustments, as needed (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments), to
reflect that the ICC Rates became effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the applicable
ICC order(s) and to retroactively true-up the ICC Rates with the corresponding rates currently contained in
this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) for the period after the effective date of the applicable ICC
order(s), in accordance herewith.
1.6 Replacement of Interim Rates
Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Products or Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party may,
within ninety (90) days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written notice
(“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the non-interim Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Current Interim Rate
counterpart(s) in this Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any
formal amendment or further Commission action, AT&T ARKANSAS will update CLEC's billing tables to
replace the Current Interim Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the
Page 382 of 551

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 5 OF 7
AT&T ARKANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC
062907
Replacement Rate Notice. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect
such Replacement Rates and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.6.1 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within 90 days after the effective date of such order, then
the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T ARKANSAS will
issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit
adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Current Interim Rates for the
period after the effective date of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.6.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the
Current Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the
issuance of that order.
1.6.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.6, but not within ninety (90) days
after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective between
the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective
date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise
superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of such amendment.
1.6.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.6 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.6) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the
Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.6.
1.7 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.7.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Appendix and Agreement, in the event that any other
telecommunications carrier should adopt provisions in the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of
the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the non-interim and/or
interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become
effective between AT&T ARKANSAS and the Adopting CLEC (i.e., following the date the
Commission approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting CLEC's Section 252(i) adoption
(“MFN Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle an
Adopting CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement to any date prior to
the MFN Effective Date and any Adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such claim
hereunder.
1.8 The following defines the zones found in this Appendix Pricing:
Rate Zone: Total Access Lines:
Zone 1 (Rural) 3,000 or fewer
Zone 2 (Suburban) 3,001 – 18,000
Zone 3 (Urban) 18,001 or Greater
1.9 AT&T ARKANSAS’ obligation to provide Interconnection, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements,
Collocation, Resale discounts, functions, facilities, products or services (“Products or Services”) under this
Agreement does not extend to Products or Services for which rates, terms and conditions are not contained
in this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent a CLEC orders a Product or Service for which there are not
rates, terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, AT&T ARKANSAS may reject the order. In the
event such an order is rejected, and the Product or Service is appropriate for BFR treatment under the BFR
Page 383 of 551

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 6 OF 7
AT&T ARKANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC
062907
provisions set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement, the CLEC may submit a BFR, which will
be evaluated pursuant to such BFR provisions. Alternatively, if the Product or Service is available in a state
commission approved Agreement in the state in which the CLEC is seeking to order the Product or Service,
the CLEC may seek to amend this Agreement to incorporate rates, terms and conditions for the Product or
Service into this Agreement, to the extent such Product or Service is still available at the time of the
request. In the event that CLEC orders, and AT&T ARKANSAS provisions, a Product or Service to CLEC
for which there are not rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees
that one of the following will occur:
1.9.1 CLEC shall pay for the Product or Service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T
ARKANSAS’ applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the Product or Service or, to the extent there are no
tariff rates, terms or conditions available for the Product or Service in the applicable state, then
CLEC shall pay for the Product or Service at AT&T ARKANSAS’ current generic contract rate for
the Product or Service set forth in AT&T ARKANSAS' applicable state-specific generic pricing
schedule as published on AT&T ARKANSAS’ CLEC website; or
1.9.2 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.9.1, above, and
AT&T ARKANSAS may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of
the product or service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into
this Agreement as set forth in this Section 1.9.
1.9.3 AT&T ARKANSAS’ provisioning of orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.9 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T ARKANSAS’ right to charge and collect
payment for such Products and/or Services.
1.10 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.10.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or "TBD" or is blank,
the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T
ARKANSAS for that Product or Service and incorporated into AT&T ARKANSAS' current state-
specific generic pricing schedule as published on AT&T ARKANSAS’ CLEC website, that rate(s)
(“Established Rate”) shall automatically apply to the Product or Service provided under this
Agreement back to the effective date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T
ARKANSAS provisioned for that Product or Service without the need for any additional
modification(s) to this Agreement or further Commission action. AT&T ARKANSAS shall provide
written notice to CLEC of the application of the rate, price or charge that has been established, and
the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate,
and the Established Rate will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the
Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment which shall reflect the Established
Rate to ensure that the Agreement accurately reflects the specific Established Rate(s) that apply to
such Product or Service pursuant to this Section 1.10, and shall submit such Amendment to the
state commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after such
Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T ARKANSAS shall bill CLEC to reflect the application of the
Established Rate retroactively to the effective date of the Agreement between the Parties.
1.10.2 AT&T ARKANSAS’ provisioning of such orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject to
this Section 1.10 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T ARKANSAS’ right to charge and
collect payment for such Products and/or Services.
2. RECURRING CHARGES
2.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Tables, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be
defined as a calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Unbundled Network Element
(UNE), Resale, Other (Resale), Other and Reciprocal Compensation elements will be one (1) month. After
the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The minimum service
period for UNEs provided under the BFR process set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement may
be longer.

AT&T ARKANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-ARKANSAS, LLC
062907
2.2 Where rates (excluding Resale) are based on minutes of use, usage will be accumulated at the End Office
Switch or other measurement point without any per call rounding and total minutes by End Office Switch or
other measurement point will then be rounded to the next higher minute.
2.3 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T ARKANSAS will first compute the mileage using the
V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No 4.
When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T ARKANSAS will round up to the next whole mile
before determining the mileage and applying rates.
2.4 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“recurring charges”.
3. NON-RECURRING CHARGES
3.1 Nonrecurring Charges are applicable for all five (5) categories of rates.
3.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there are non-recurring charges for each UNE on the first connection
on an CLEC order as well as separate non-recurring charges for each additional connection associated with
the same CLEC order at the same CLEC specified premises.
3.3 For Resale, when a CLEC converts an End User currently receiving non-complex service from the AT&T
ARKANSAS network, without any changes to AT&T ARKANSAS’ network, the normal service order
charges and/or nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
3.4 CLEC shall pay a non-recurring charge when a CLEC adds or removes a signaling point code. The
rates and charges for signaling point code(s) are identified in the applicable access tariffs. This charge
also applies to point code information provided by CLEC allowing others to use CLEC’s SS7 signaling
network.
3.5 CLEC shall pay a service order processing charge (Service Order Charge) for each service order issued by
AT&T ARKANSAS to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement, changes to or
record orders for Lawful UNEs.
3.6 Some items, which must be individually charged, are billed as nonrecurring charges.
3.7 Time and Material charges (a.k.a. additional labor charges) are defined in FCC Tariff 73.
4. BILLING
4.1 For information regarding billing, non-payment, disconnects and dispute resolution, see the General Terms
and Conditions of this Agreement.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Appendix sets forth the pricing terms and conditions only for the applicable AT&T Inc. (AT&T) owned
Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) identified in 1.3 below. The rate table included in this Appendix
is divided into the following five categories: Unbundled Network Elements (UNEs), Resale, Other (Resale),
Other and Reciprocal Compensation. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be
construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement,
including but not limited to the term “Lawful UNE,” as that term is defined and used in this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T Inc. (AT&T) means the holding company which directly or indirectly owns the following ILECs: Illinois
Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Illinois, Indiana Bell Telephone Company Incorporated d/b/a AT&T
Indiana, Michigan Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan, Nevada Bell Telephone Company d/b/a
AT&T Nevada, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Ohio, Pacific Bell Telephone Company
d/b/a AT&T California, The Southern New England Telephone Company, Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company d/b/a AT&T Arkansas, AT&T Kansas, AT&T Missouri, AT&T Oklahoma and/or AT&T Texas
and/or Wisconsin Bell, Inc. d/b/a AT&T Wisconsin.
1.3 AT&T KANSAS - As used herein, AT&T KANSAS means Southwestern Bell Telephone Company d/b/a
AT&T Kansas, the applicable AT&T-owned ILEC doing business in Kansas.
1.4 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
Certain of the non-interim rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established
by the Commission (“Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement
that are not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.4, or that are not marked as interim or
as “TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Non-Interim Rates. If, during
the Term of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable to the
Interconnection, Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, functions, facilities, Resale discounts, or
products or services (“Products or Services”) available under this Agreement (i.e. not an order or docket
relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration), either Party may provide
written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party, after the effective date of such order, that it
wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and
supersede the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) already set forth in this Agreement. Following
such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for any formal amendment or further
Commission action, the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the
Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3, below, and the
Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as provided in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3,
below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment which shall reflect that the
Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) were replaced by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such
Amendment to the state commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after
such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party any adjustments that are necessary to
reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the Parties as provided below:
1.4.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any
such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the effective
date of the order, and AT&T KANSAS will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of
additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified Rate(s) with the
Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of the order, in
accordance herewith.

AT&T KANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
1.4.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.4.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.4, but not within ninety
(90) days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment
effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or
otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s)
for any period prior to the effective date of such amendment.
1.4.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.4 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.4) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)
with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.4.
1.5 The Parties understand and agree that on May 9, 2003, the Public Utilities Act of Illinois was amended to
add Sections 13-408 and 13-409, 220 ILCS 5/13-408 and 13-409, and enacted into law ("Illinois Law"). The
Illinois Law establishes a specific method for setting certain UNE rates in Illinois, mandates that the Illinois
Commerce Commission (“ICC”) apply the method and determine the rates (“ICC Rates”), and expressly
deems all interconnection agreements to be amended to contain the ICC Rates immediately upon the ICC's
announcement of such adjusted rates, without further action. The Parties understand and agree that the
rates in the attached Pricing Schedule are based upon AT&T Illinois’ obligations under FCC rules and
regulations, and applicable ICC orders as they existed prior to the ICC’s promulgation of rates, terms and
conditions pursuant to the Illinois Law. The Parties understand and agree that the ICC Rates shall
automatically apply to this Agreement, and shall replace and supersede any corresponding rates currently
contained in this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) as of the effective date of any such ICC order(s)
upon the written request of either Party (“Written Notice”). As soon as practical following the Written Notice,
AT&T Illinois shall begin billing CLEC the ICC Rates; provided, however, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that no later than sixty (60) days from the Written Notice, the Parties will execute a conforming
Amendment to this Agreement so that the Agreement accurately reflects the ICC Rates, and AT&T Illinois
will issue any adjustments, as needed (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments), to
reflect that the ICC Rates became effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the applicable
ICC order(s) and to retroactively true-up the ICC Rates with the corresponding rates currently contained in
this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) for the period after the effective date of the applicable ICC
order(s), in accordance herewith.
1.6 Replacement of Interim Rates
Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Products or Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party may,
within ninety (90) days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written notice
(“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the non-interim Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Current Interim Rate
counterpart(s) in this Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any
formal amendment or further Commission action, AT&T KANSAS will update CLEC's billing tables to
replace the Current Interim Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the
Page 411 of 551

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 5 OF 7
AT&T KANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
Replacement Rate Notice. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect
such Replacement Rates and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.6.1 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within 90 days after the effective date of such order, then
the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T KANSAS will
issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit
adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Current Interim Rates for the
period after the effective date of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.6.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the
Current Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the
issuance of that order.
1.6.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.6, but not within ninety (90) days
after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective between
the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective
date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise
superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of such amendment.
1.6.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.6 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.6) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the
Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.6.
1.7 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.7.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Appendix and Agreement, in the event that any other
telecommunications carrier should adopt provisions in the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of
the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the non-interim and/or
interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become
effective between AT&T KANSAS and the Adopting CLEC (i.e., following the date the Commission
approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting CLEC's Section 252(i) adoption (“MFN
Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle an Adopting
CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement to any date prior to the MFN
Effective Date and any Adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such claim hereunder.
1.8 The following defines the zones found in this Appendix Pricing:
Zone: Rate Group Description:
Zone 1 1, 2, and 3 0-5,999
Zone 2 4 and 5 6,000-99,999
Zone 3 6, 7, and 8 Greater than 100,000
1.9 AT&T KANSAS’ obligation to provide Interconnection, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation,
Resale discounts, functions, facilities, products or services (“Products or Services”) under this Agreement
does not extend to Products or Services for which rates, terms and conditions are not contained in this
Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent a CLEC orders a Product or Service for which there are not rates,
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, AT&T KANSAS may reject the order. In the event such
an order is rejected, and the Product or Service is appropriate for BFR treatment under the BFR provisions
set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement, the CLEC may submit a BFR, which will be evaluated
Page 412 of 551

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 6 OF 7
AT&T KANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
pursuant to such BFR provisions. Alternatively, if the Product or Service is available in a state commission
approved Agreement in the state in which the CLEC is seeking to order the Product or Service, the CLEC
may seek to amend this Agreement to incorporate rates, terms and conditions for the Product or Service
into this Agreement, to the extent such Product or Service is still available at the time of the request. In the
event that CLEC orders, and AT&T KANSAS provisions, a Product or Service to CLEC for which there are
not rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees that one of the
following will occur:
1.9.1 CLEC shall pay for the Product or Service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T
KANSAS’ applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the Product or Service or, to the extent there are no tariff
rates, terms or conditions available for the Product or Service in the applicable state, then CLEC
shall pay for the Product or Service at AT&T KANSAS’ current generic contract rate for the Product
or Service set forth in AT&T KANSAS’ applicable state-specific generic pricing schedule as
published on AT&T KANSAS’ CLEC website; or
1.9.2 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.9.1, above, and
AT&T KANSAS may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of the
product or service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into this
Agreement as set forth in this Section 1.9.
1.9.3 AT&T KANSAS’ provisioning of orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.9 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T KANSAS’ right to charge and collect
payment for such Products and/or Services.
1.10 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.10.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or "TBD" or is blank,
the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T
KANSAS for that Product or Service and incorporated into AT&T KANSAS' current state-specific
generic pricing schedule as published on AT&T KANSAS’ CLEC website, that rate(s) (“Established
Rate”) shall automatically apply to the Product or Service provided under this Agreement back to the
effective date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T KANSAS provisioned
for that Product or Service without the need for any additional modification(s) to this Agreement or
further Commission action. AT&T KANSAS shall provide written notice to CLEC of the application
of the rate, price or charge that has been established, and the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated
to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate, and the Established Rate will be deemed
effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate
a conforming amendment which shall reflect the Established Rate to ensure that the Agreement
accurately reflects the specific Established Rate(s) that apply to such Product or Service pursuant to
this Section 1.10, and shall submit such Amendment to the state commission for approval. In
addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after such Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T
KANSAS shall bill CLEC to reflect the application of the Established Rate retroactively to the
effective date of the Agreement between the Parties.
1.10.2 AT&T KANSAS’ provisioning of such orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject to
this Section 1.10 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T KANSAS’ right to charge and collect
payment for such Products and/or Services.
2. RECURRING CHARGES
2.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Tables, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be
defined as a calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Unbundled Network Element
(UNE), Resale, Other (Resale), Other and Reciprocal Compensation elements will be one (1) month. After
the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The minimum service
period for UNEs provided under the BFR process set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement may
be longer.

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 7 OF 7
AT&T KANSAS/NEUTRAL TANDEM-KANSAS, LLC
062907
2.2 Where rates (excluding Resale) are based on minutes of use, usage will be accumulated at the End Office
Switch or other measurement point without any per call rounding and total minutes by End Office Switch or
other measurement point will then be rounded to the next higher minute.
2.3 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T KANSAS will first compute the mileage using the
V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No 4.
When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T KANSAS will round up to the next whole mile
before determining the mileage and applying rates.
2.4 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“recurring charges”.
3. NON-RECURRING CHARGES
3.1 Nonrecurring Charges are applicable for all five (5) categories of rates.
3.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there are non-recurring charges for each UNE on the first connection
on an CLEC order as well as separate non-recurring charges for each additional connection associated with
the same CLEC order at the same CLEC specified premises.
3.3 For Resale, when a CLEC converts an End User currently receiving non-complex service from the AT&T
KANSAS network, without any changes to AT&T KANSAS’ network, the normal service order charges
and/or nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
3.4 CLEC shall pay a non-recurring charge when a CLEC adds or removes a signaling point code. The rates
and charges for signaling point code(s) are identified in the applicable access tariffs. This charge also
applies to point code information provided by CLEC allowing others to use CLEC’s SS7 signaling network.
3.5 CLEC shall pay a service order processing charge (Service Order Charge) for each service order issued by
AT&T KANSAS to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement, changes to or record
orders for Lawful UNEs.
3.6 Some items, which must be individually charged, are billed as nonrecurring charges.
3.7 Time and Material charges (a.k.a. additional labor charges) are defined in FCC Tariff 73.
4. BILLING
4.1 For information regarding billing, non-payment, disconnects and dispute resolution, see the General Terms
and Conditions of this Agreement.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Appendix sets forth the pricing terms and conditions only for the applicable AT&T Inc. (AT&T) owned
Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) identified in 1.3 below. The rate table included in this Appendix
is divided into the following five categories: Unbundled Network Elements (UNEs), Resale, Other (Resale),
Other and Reciprocal Compensation. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be
construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement,
including but not limited to the term “Lawful UNE,” as that term is defined and used in this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T Inc. (AT&T) means the holding company which directly or indirectly owns the following ILECs: Illinois
Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Illinois, Indiana Bell Telephone Company Incorporated d/b/a AT&T
Indiana, Michigan Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan, Nevada Bell Telephone Company d/b/a
AT&T Nevada, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Ohio, Pacific Bell Telephone Company
d/b/a AT&T California, The Southern New England Telephone Company, Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company d/b/a AT&T Arkansas, AT&T Kansas, AT&T Missouri, AT&T Oklahoma and/or AT&T Texas
and/or Wisconsin Bell, Inc. d/b/a AT&T Wisconsin.
1.3 AT&T OKLAHOMA - As used herein, AT&T OKLAHOMA means Southwestern Bell Telephone Company
d/b/a AT&T Oklahoma, the applicable AT&T-owned ILEC doing business in Oklahoma.
1.4 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
Certain of the non-interim rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established
by the Commission (“Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement
that are not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.4, or that are not marked as interim or
as “TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Non-Interim Rates. If, during
the Term of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable to the
Interconnection, Unbundled Network Elements, Collocation, functions, facilities, Resale discounts, or
products or services (“Products or Services”) available under this Agreement (i.e. not an order or docket
relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration), either Party may provide
written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party, after the effective date of such order, that it
wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and
supersede the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) already set forth in this Agreement. Following
such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for any formal amendment or further
Commission action, the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the
Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3, below, and the
Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as provided in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3,
below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment which shall reflect that the
Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) were replaced by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such
Amendment to the state commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after
such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party any adjustments that are necessary to
reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the Parties as provided below:
1.4.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any
such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the effective
date of the order, and AT&T OKLAHOMA will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g.,
billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified Rate(s)
with the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of the
order, in accordance herewith.

AT&T OKLAHOMA/NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC

1.4.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.4.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.4, but not within ninety
(90) days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment
effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or
otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s)
for any period prior to the effective date of such amendment.
1.4.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.4 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.4) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s)
with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.4.
1.5 The Parties understand and agree that on May 9, 2003, the Public Utilities Act of Illinois was amended to
add Sections 13-408 and 13-409, 220 ILCS 5/13-408 and 13-409, and enacted into law ("Illinois Law"). The
Illinois Law establishes a specific method for setting certain UNE rates in Illinois, mandates that the Illinois
Commerce Commission (“ICC”) apply the method and determine the rates (“ICC Rates”), and expressly
deems all interconnection agreements to be amended to contain the ICC Rates immediately upon the ICC's
announcement of such adjusted rates, without further action. The Parties understand and agree that the
rates in the attached Pricing Schedule are based upon AT&T Illinois’ obligations under FCC rules and
regulations, and applicable ICC orders as they existed prior to the ICC’s promulgation of rates, terms and
conditions pursuant to the Illinois Law. The Parties understand and agree that the ICC Rates shall
automatically apply to this Agreement, and shall replace and supersede any corresponding rates currently
contained in this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) as of the effective date of any such ICC order(s)
upon the written request of either Party (“Written Notice”). As soon as practical following the Written Notice,
AT&T Illinois shall begin billing CLEC the ICC Rates; provided, however, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that no later than sixty (60) days from the Written Notice, the Parties will execute a conforming
Amendment to this Agreement so that the Agreement accurately reflects the ICC Rates, and AT&T Illinois
will issue any adjustments, as needed (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments), to
reflect that the ICC Rates became effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the applicable
ICC order(s) and to retroactively true-up the ICC Rates with the corresponding rates currently contained in
this Agreement (for the state of Illinois only) for the period after the effective date of the applicable ICC
order(s), in accordance herewith.
1.6 Replacement of Interim Rates
Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Products or Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party may,
within ninety (90) days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written notice
(“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the non-interim Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Current Interim Rate
counterpart(s) in this Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any
formal amendment or further Commission action, AT&T OKLAHOMA will update CLEC's billing tables to
replace the Current Interim Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the
Page 440 of 551

APPENDIX PRICING/SOUTHWESTERN BELL TLEEPHONE COMPANY.
PAGE 5 OF 7
AT&T OKLAHOMA/NEUTRAL TANDEM-OKLAHOMA, LLC
062907
Replacement Rate Notice. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect
such Replacement Rates and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.6.1 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within 90 days after the effective date of such order, then
the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T OKLAHOMA will
issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit
adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Current Interim Rates for the
period after the effective date of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.6.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the
Current Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the
issuance of that order.
1.6.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.6, but not within ninety (90) days
after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective between
the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is
deemed to have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective
date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise
superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of such amendment.
1.6.4 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.6 was not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.6) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply,
beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be
foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the
Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this
Section 1.6.
1.7 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.7.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Appendix and Agreement, in the event that any other
telecommunications carrier should adopt provisions in the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of
the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the non-interim and/or
interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become
effective between AT&T OKLAHOMA and the Adopting CLEC (i.e., following the date the
Commission approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting CLEC's Section 252(i) adoption
(“MFN Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle an
Adopting CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement to any date prior to
the MFN Effective Date and any Adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such claim
hereunder.
1.8 The following defines the zones found in this Appendix Pricing:
Rate Zone: Description:
Zone A The geographic area within each of the AT&T OKLAHOMA exchanges which are
classified as Rate Group 1, 2, or 3 exchanges in AT&T OKLAHOMA’s Local Exchange

1.9 AT&T OKLAHOMA’s obligation to provide Interconnection, Lawful Unbundled Network Elements,
Collocation, Resale discounts, functions, facilities, products or services (“Products or Services”) under this
Agreement does not extend to Products or Services for which rates, terms and conditions are not contained
in this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent a CLEC orders a Product or Service for which there are not
rates, terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, AT&T OKLAHOMA may reject the order. In the
event such an order is rejected, and the Product or Service is appropriate for BFR treatment under the BFR
provisions set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement, the CLEC may submit a BFR, which will
be evaluated pursuant to such BFR provisions. Alternatively, if the Product or Service is available in a state
commission approved Agreement in the state in which the CLEC is seeking to order the Product or Service,
the CLEC may seek to amend this Agreement to incorporate rates, terms and conditions for the Product or
Service into this Agreement, to the extent such Product or Service is still available at the time of the
request. In the event that CLEC orders, and AT&T OKLAHOMA provisions, a Product or Service to CLEC
for which there are not rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees
that one of the following will occur:
1.9.1 CLEC shall pay for the Product or Service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T
OKLAHOMA’s applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the Product or Service or, to the extent there are no
tariff rates, terms or conditions available for the Product or Service in the applicable state, then
CLEC shall pay for the Product or Service at AT&T OKLAHOMA’s current generic contract rate for
the Product or Service set forth in AT&T OKLAHOMA's applicable state-specific generic pricing
schedule as published on AT&T OKLAHOMA’s CLEC website; or
1.9.2 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.9.1, above, and
AT&T OKLAHOMA may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of
the product or service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into
this Agreement as set forth in this Section 1.9.
1.9.3 AT&T OKLAHOMA’s provisioning of orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject to
this Section 1.9 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T OKLAHOMA’s right to charge and
collect payment for such Products and/or Services.
1.10 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.10.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or “TBD” or is blank,
the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T
OKLAHOMA for that Product or Service and incorporated into AT&T OKLAHOMA's current state-
specific generic pricing schedule as published on AT&T OKLAHOMA’s CLEC website, that rate(s)
(“Established Rate”) shall automatically apply to the Product or Service provided under this
Agreement back to the effective date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T
OKLAHOMA provisioned for that Product or Service without the need for any additional
modification(s) to this Agreement or further Commission action. AT&T OKLAHOMA shall provide
written notice to CLEC of the application of the rate, price or charge that has been established, and
the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate,
and the Established Rate will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the effective date of the
Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment which shall reflect the Established
Rate to ensure that the Agreement accurately reflects the specific Established Rate(s) that apply to
such Product or Service pursuant to this Section 1.10, and shall submit such Amendment to the
state commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is reasonably practicable after such
Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T OKLAHOMA shall bill CLEC to reflect the application of the
Established Rate retroactively to the effective date of the Agreement between the Parties.
1.10.2 AT&T OKLAHOMA’s provisioning of such orders for such Products or Services is expressly subject
to this Section 1.10 and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T OKLAHOMA’s right to charge and
collect payment for such Products and/or Services.

2. RECURRING CHARGES
2.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Tables, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be
defined as a calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Unbundled Network Element
(UNE), Resale, Other (Resale), Other and Reciprocal Compensation elements will be one (1) month. After
the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The minimum service
period for UNEs provided under the BFR process set forth in Appendix Lawful UNEs of this Agreement may
be longer.
2.2 Where rates (excluding Resale) are based on minutes of use, usage will be accumulated at the End Office
Switch or other measurement point without any per call rounding and total minutes by End Office Switch or
other measurement point will then be rounded to the next higher minute.
2.3 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T OKLAHOMA will first compute the mileage using
the V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No
4. When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T OKLAHOMA will round up to the next whole
mile before determining the mileage and applying rates.
2.4 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“recurring charges”.
3. NON-RECURRING CHARGES
3.1 Nonrecurring Charges are applicable for all five (5) categories of rates.
3.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there are non-recurring charges for each UNE on the first connection
on an CLEC order as well as separate non-recurring charges for each additional connection associated with
the same CLEC order at the same CLEC specified premises.
3.3 For Resale, when a CLEC converts an End User currently receiving non-complex service from the AT&T
OKLAHOMA network, without any changes to AT&T OKLAHOMA’s network, the normal service order
charges and/or nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
3.4 CLEC shall pay a non-recurring charge when a CLEC adds or removes a signaling point code. The rates
and charges for signaling point code(s) are identified in the applicable access tariffs. This charge also
applies to point code information provided by CLEC allowing others to use CLEC’s SS7 signaling network.
3.5 CLEC shall pay a service order processing charge (Service Order Charge) for each service order issued by
AT&T OKLAHOMA to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement, changes to or
record orders for Lawful UNEs.
3.6 Some items, which must be individually charged, are billed as nonrecurring charges.
3.7 Time and Material charges (a.k.a. additional labor charges) are defined in FCC Tariff 73.
4. BILLING
4.1 For information regarding billing, non-payment, disconnects and dispute resolution, see the General Terms
and Conditions of this Agreement.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit A sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
KANSAS and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA act as a Transit Service Provider (“AT&T-TSP”) for CLEC. Transit Traffic
Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic that does not originate with, or
terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to exchange CLEC originated traffic with a
Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly interconnected, and it allows CLEC to receive traffic
originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier. AT&T-TSP offers Transit Traffic Services to interconnected CLECs or
to interconnected Out of Exchange Local Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit A. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit A. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit A, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and/or
AT&T OKLAHOMA as those entities provide Transit Traffic Services to CLEC and Third Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,

nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch
subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.

6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA the same facilities and trunking (ordering,
provisioning, servicing, etc.) used to route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements.
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T ARKANSAS,
AT&T KANSAS and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA Transit Traffic MOUs include Local minutes of use only. CLEC
agrees to compensate AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA as a Transit
Service Provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule,

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.

Page 4 of 9
Page 22 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
Page 500 of 551

Contract Id: 4924919
Attachment – OS/DA – Exhibit B/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 9
Page 23 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect

Attachment – OS/DA – Exhibit B/AT&T-21STATE
Page 6 of 9
Page 24 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.

Page 7 of 9
Page 25 of 57 NEUTRAL TANDEM
Version: 1Q16 - CLEC ICA – 05/05/16
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users, non-discriminatory access to
listings, as described herein.
4.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will meet state requirements to make available listings through itself or a contracted vendor
to provide listings for its ILEC Territory, as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.2.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-
Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs
and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not provide a resale discount for
any listings.

4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 Distribution of Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy per primary End
User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages directory in the
same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-21STATE’s
subscribers.
4.2.4 AT&T-21STATE shall direct its publishing vendor to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the “Information
Pages”, or comparable section of its white pages directories (covering the territory where CLEC is certified
to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair, customer service and
billing information.
4.2.5 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.5.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
4.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber

WHEREAS, Onvoy represents that it has authority to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements;
WHEREAS, Onvoy desires to continue to purchase services from AT&T under the Neutral Tandem Agreements;
WHEREAS, AT&T and Onvoy agree to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements to reflect the name change to Onvoy,

will subsequently be provided by AT&T to Onvoy under the Neutral Tandem Agreements, as amended, including by way of
name change from Neutral Tandem to Onvoy.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, AT&T and Onvoy agree
to amend the Neutral Tandem Agreements as follows:
1. This Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals, the terms and conditions, contained within, Exhibit A – Listing of

3.1 AT&T shall reflect the assignment from “Neutral Tandem” to “Onvoy, LLC” only for the main billing account (header

previously billed to Neutral Tandem, including to the services and items provided and/or billed thereunder or under
the Neutral Tandem Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, Onvoy affirms, represents, and warrants that the
ACNA and OCN for those accounts shall not change from that previously used by Neutral Tandem with AT&T for

Agreements.

N.6 In addition, CLEC agrees that it is responsible for providing AT&T-21STATE with CLEC’s OCN and ACNA
numbers for the states in which CLEC is authorized to do business and in which CLEC is requesting that this
Agreement apply. In the event that CLEC wants to change and/or add to the OCN and/or ACNA information
in the CLEC Profile, CLEC shall send written notice to AT&T-21STATE to be received at least thirty (30) days
prior to the change and/or addition in accordance with this Section N notice provision; CLEC shall also update
its CLEC Profile through the applicable form and/or web-based interface.
N.6.1 CLEC may not order services under a new account and/or subsequent state certification, established
in accordance with this Section until thirty (30) days after all information specified in this Section is
received from CLEC.
N.6.2 CLEC may be able to place orders for certain services in AT&T-21STATE without having properly
updated the CLEC Profile; however, at any time during the term of this Agreement without additional
notice AT&T may at its discretion eliminate such functionality. At such time, if CLEC has not properly
updated its CLEC Profile, ordering capabilities will cease, and CLEC will not be able to place orders
until thirty (30) days after CLEC has properly updated its CLEC Profile.
N.7 AT&T communicates official information to CLECs via its Accessible Letter, or other applicable, notification
processes. These processes involve electronic transmission and/or posting to the AT&T CLEC Online
website, inclusive of a variety of subjects including declaration of a force majeure, changes on business
processes and policies, and other product/service related notices not requiring an amendment to this
Agreement.
7. This Amendment shall be deemed to revise the terms and provisions of the Neutral Tandem Agreements only to the extent
necessary to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Amendment. In the event of a conflict between the terms and
provisions of this Amendment and the terms and provisions of the Neutral Tandem Agreements (including all incorporated
or accompanying Appendices, Addenda, and Exhibits to the Neutral Tandem Agreements), this Amendment shall govern,
provided, however, that the fact that a term or provision appears in this Amendment but not in the Neutral Tandem
Agreements, or in the Neutral Tandem Agreements but not in this Amendment, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed
grounds for finding, a conflict for purposes of this Amendment.
8. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying Neutral Tandem
Agreements (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with
respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully
incorporated into this Neutral Tandem Agreements or which may be the subject of further review.
9. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING NEUTRAL TANDEM
AGREEMENTS SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
10. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Neutral Tandem Agreements, but
rather, shall be coterminous with such Neutral Tandem Agreements.
11. Signatures by all Parties to this Amendment are required to effectuate this Amendment. This Amendment may be executed
in counterparts. Each counterpart shall be considered an original and such counterparts shall together constitute one and
the same instrument.
12. For all States except Arkansas, California, and Wisconsin: This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval
by the State Commission and shall become effective ten (10) days following approval by such Commission. For Arkansas:
This Amendment shall be filed with the Arkansas Public Service Commission and shall become effective upon filing. For

This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Agreement(s) by and between AT&T and CLEC as shown in the
attached Exhibit B.
WHEREAS, AT&T and CLEC are parties to the Interconnection Agreements as shown in the attached Exhibit B, under
Sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the “Act”) and as subsequently amended (the
“Agreement”); and
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Agreement to implement the FCC Orders FCC-19-66 and FCC-19-72 in WC
Dkt. No. 18-141; Petition of USTelecom for Forbearance Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 160(c) to Accelerate Investment in
Broadband and Next-Generation Networks which was filed with the FCC on May 4, 2018 (“FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance
Order”); and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to
amend the Agreement as follows:
1. The Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals and the terms and conditions contained herein, all of which
are hereby incorporated by this reference and constitute a part of this Amendment.
2. As of February 2, 2020, except for resale services that are grandfathered pursuant to subsection a, CLEC may no
longer purchase any resale services pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any
resale Tariff referred to in this Agreement, other than the rates, terms and conditions provided for in Attachment
251(b)(1) Resale.
a. Resale services ordered on or before February 1, 2020 (“Resale Embedded Base”), are grandfathered until
August 2, 2022, and available only:
i. to the same End User; and
ii. at that same End User’s existing location;
iii. both as of February 2, 2020.
3. Add Attachment - 251(b)(1) Resale to the Agreement.
4. As of February 2, 2020, CLEC may no longer order 2-Wire Analog UNE Loops or 4-Wire Analog UNE Loops (“Analog
Loops”) pursuant to this Agreement. Any existing Analog Loops ordered on or before February 1, 2020 (“Analog
Loop Embedded Base”) are grandfathered until August 2, 2022. CLEC shall convert the Analog Loop Embedded
Base to a commercial offering, or other comparable service, or disconnect such Analog Loop on, or before, August 1,
2022. Exhibit A to this Amendment contains Analog Loop element descriptions and USOCs that are subject to the
FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance Order, however this Agreement may also contain additional and/or older element
descriptions and USOCs that are also Analog Loops subject to the FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance Order.

Amendment - FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance/AT&T-21STATE
Page 2 of 3
Onvoy, LLC
Version 09/27/19
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining Analog Loops and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and non-
recurring charges:
i. convert to an analogous arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement executed by
the Parties, or
ii. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions
shall apply), or
iii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iv. disconnect.
b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between an Analog Loop rate and the non-UNE rate
that applies under this Section 4 for any new Analog Loops inadvertently ordered on or after February 2, 2020,
and any Analog Loop Embedded Base remaining as of August 1, 2022.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the Analog Loop shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the Analog Loop to an
analogous arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement or an AT&T tariff or guidebook
service.
5. As of January 12, 2020, CLEC may no longer order DS1/DS3 Unbundled Dedicated Transport (“DS1/DS3 UDT”),
whether stand-alone or part of a combination (e.g., Enhanced Extended Link), pursuant to this Agreement between
Tier 1 wire centers and/or wire centers subject to UDT forbearance under Public Notice DA 19-733, dated August 1,
2019. Any such existing DS1/DS3 UDT ordered on or before January 11, 2020, is grandfathered until July 12, 2022
(“UDT Embedded Base”).
i. CLEC must convert any grandfathered DS1/DS3 UDT to another product/service offering on or
before July 12, 2022, pursuant to the Conversion of 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combinations to
Wholesale Services provisions of this Agreement or other similar provision.
ii. If CLEC fails to convert grandfathered DS1/DS3 UDT before July 12, 2022, at AT&T’s sole
discretion, AT&T may convert any, or all, of the remaining DS1/DS3 UDT to the equivalent Special
Access service at month-to-month rates, terms and conditions. CLEC shall be responsible for all
associated recurring and non-recurring charges.
iii. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between a DS1/DS3 UDT rate and the
non-UNE rate that applies under this Section 5 for any new circuits inadvertently ordered on or
after January 12, 2020 and any UDT Embedded Base remaining as of July 12, 2022.
iv. If the FCC determines that additional wire centers are subject to forbearance, CLEC shall cease
ordering DS1/DS3 UDT as of the date specified by the FCC and adhere to any FCC-specified
transition timelines.
6. Any future forbearance from or rule changes for Section 251(c)(3) UNEs offered pursuant to this Agreement shall be
incorporated by reference as of the effective date of the FCC order and shall not require a written amendment. AT&T
shall provide Notice to CLEC of how the Parties will implement the subsequent UNE forbearance or rule change.
Notice will include applicable transition periods and any changes to rate(s), term(s) and/or condition(s) to the
underlying Agreement.
7. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying
Agreement (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment)
with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not
yet fully incorporated into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
8. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall
be coterminous with such Agreement.

Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Section 251(b)(1) resale services (“Resale Services”) provided by
AT&T-21STATE to CLEC.
1.2 Pursuant to Section 251(b)(1), beginning February 2, 2020, CLEC may order and AT&T-21STATE shall make
available to CLEC for resale, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of this Attachment, Telecommunications
Services that AT&T-21STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not Telecommunications Carriers. Beginning
August 2, 2022, this Attachment shall govern all Resale Services CLEC purchases from AT&T-21STATE, including
Resale Services that were purchased prior to August 2, 2022 pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and/or
resale tariff and that remain in service as of that date (“Resale Embedded Base”).
2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are currently offered to AT&T-21STATE’s End Users at
retail.
2.2 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a retail service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of the state-specific retail
Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that same End User’s existing location;
(iii) both as of the time of that service’s grandfathering.
2.3 AT&T-21STATE may withdraw the availability of certain Telecommunication Services that AT&T-21STATE previously
provisioned to CLEC or retail End Users pursuant to C.F.R 51.325 through 51.335 as such rules may be amended
from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
2.4 CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-21STATE’s corresponding
retail Tariff(s). Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to provide access or interconnection services to
itself, interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), interconnected VoIP
providers (IVPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), or other Telecommunications providers; provided,
however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local exchange telephone service to access IXCs,
wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers. CLEC may not resell any Resale Services to
another CLEC, including its own Affiliate(s).
2.5 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific retail Tariff(s) shall govern the rates, terms and
conditions associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, except for any resale
restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply. CLEC
and its End Users may not use Resale Services in any manner not permitted for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users. Any
change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective
hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.6 CLEC shall only sell Plexar, Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the retail Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is
being offered.
2.7 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-21STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of
Resale Services by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
2.8 CLEC shall only provide Resale Services under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to which AT&T-
21STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).
2.9 Special Needs Services are services for the physically disabled as defined in state-specific Tariffs. Where available
for resale in accordance with state-specific Tariffs, CLEC may resell Special Needs Services to End Users who are

Attachment 16b – Resale 251(b)(1)/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 6
Onvoy, LLC
Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
eligible for each such service. To the extent CLEC provides Resale Services that require certification on the part of
the End User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as established by
the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
2.10 When ordering Resale Services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-21STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original End User service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End User(s) for such offering or promotion. AT&T-21STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each
promotion per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
2.11 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for resale.
Promotions lasting longer than ninety (90) calendar (“Long-Term Promotions”) may be made available for resale.
AT&T 21-STATE may eliminate any Resale Discount on all or certain Long-Term Promotions by providing a 45-day
notice of such elimination.
2.12 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have the breach
cure period as specified in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement to correct the violation and notify
AT&T-21STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected. AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC the greater of:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for the
stated violation; or
(ii) the actual amounts CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation.
2.13 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption or
resale to similarly-situated End Users of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof. Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by
both Parties and approval by the Commission(s).
2.14 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-21STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-21STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-21STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
3.0 PRICING AND DISCOUNTS
3.1 “Resale Discount” means the applicable discount off retail rates applied to AT&T-21STATE Telecommunications
Services resold by CLEC to its End Users. Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable retail
Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
3.2 The Resale Discounts in the underlying Interconnection Agreement will apply until AT&T-21STATE provides
notification of change to the Resale Discounts. AT&T-21STATE will provide such notification at least three (3) months
in advance of any change to current Resale Discounts. Changes to the Resale Discounts will be posted to AT&T
CLEC Online and will be incorporated by reference upon the effective date stated therein. For avoidance of doubt,
changes to Resale Discounts do not apply to Embedded Base Resale until August 2, 2022.
4.0 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-21STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-21STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.

4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-21STATE may reclaim the End User or
process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-21STATE maintenance
center(s) as provided in the CLEC Online Handbook(s). CLEC End Users calling AT&T-21STATE will be referred to
CLEC at the telephone number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to
authorize CLEC to repair, maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-21STATE’s network facilities, including without
limitation those facilities on End User premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ that activate Call Trace, or who are experiencing annoying calls, should contact law enforcement.
Law Enforcement works with the appropriate AT&T-21STATE operations centers responsible for handling such
requests. AT&T-21STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End Users to provide call records to the proper
authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether
that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against any claim, loss or damage arising from providing
this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the corrective action necessary with its End User
who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-21STATE taking corrective action, up to and including
disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-21STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-21STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
5.0 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF RATES AND CHARGES
5.1 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Attachment, including
but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.
5.1.1 Interexchange carrier traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services messages)
received by AT&T-21STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as unbillable and will
not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those messages to the carrier
indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be billed by AT&T-21STATE.
5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall not be responsible for how the associated charges for Resale Services may be allocated to
End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC under this Attachment
will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for toll and information services (for
example, 900 calls), CLEC must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this
Attachment and pay any applicable charges. It is CLEC’s responsibility to order the appropriate toll
restriction or blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for
certain types of calls, including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Call Completion.
Depending on the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may
bypass blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any
charges associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that
bypass blocking systems.
5.3 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate FCC or Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this

Attachment.
5.4 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
6.0 ANCILLARY SERVICES
6.1 E911 Emergency Service: The terms and conditions for the provision of AT&T-21STATE 911 services are contained
in Attachment 911/E911.
6.2 Payphone Services: CLEC may provide certain local Telecommunications Services to Payphone Service Providers
(PSPs) for PSPs’ use in providing payphone service. Rates for Payphone Services are established under the
provisions of Section 276 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and are not eligible for the Resale Discount
unless required by State Commission order(s). However, given certain billing system limitations, the Resale Discount
may be applied to Payphone Services, unless and until AT&T-21STATE is able to modify its billing system, AT&T-
21STATE may issue true-up bills in accordance with the provisions set forth in the General Terms and Conditions.
7.0 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE
7.1 See applicable Tariff(s) for rates, terms and conditions regarding Suspension of Service.
7.2 AT&T-21STATE will offer Suspension of Service to CLEC for CLEC initiated suspension of service of the CLEC’s
End Users. This service is not considered a Telecommunications Service and will receive no Resale Discount.
