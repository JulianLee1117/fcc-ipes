Re: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of BIuIP Inc.;
Application of B/u/P Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to
Section 52.15(8) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 97-
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, BIuIP Inc. ("BIuIP") hereby submits its
application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
BIuIP respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission's rules, 47
C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to certain information within the application, including Exhibits B and C, because those
documents contain sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the
Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").' BIuIP is voluntarily providing this information, which is "of a kind
that would not customarily be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under
FOIA.2 Moreover, BIuIP would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibit[ ] is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT —NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's Rules,4 BIuIP hereby
states as follows:
IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.S
BIuIP seeks confidential treatment of certain text and Exhibits B and C to the enclosed
application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
BIuIP is submitting as Exhibits B and C the agreements between it and its carrier partners, as
proof of BIuIP's facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's
rules.

3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.'
The information for which BIuIP seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors."8 Exhibits B and C contain
confidential agreements between BIuIP and its carrier partners and contains proprietary
commercial information concerning BIuIP's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibits B and C and certain text in the application contain information relating to commercial
matters that could be used by competitors to BIuIP's disadvantage. BIuIP has numerous
competitors in the Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") and managed services sector in which it
operates. Detailed operations and commercial information of the type provided by BIuIP could
compromise BIuIP's position in this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in
substantial competitive harm to BIuIP.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.~o
Competitors could use BIuiP's proprietary commercial and operational information to BIuIP's
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how BIuIP provides services
as well as about BIuIP's commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.'
BIuIP has not distributed the redacted information in the text of the application and Exhibits B and
C to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES.12
BIuIP has not previously disclosed the information in the text of the application and in Exhibits B
and C.
JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
BIuIP requests that the redacted information in the text of the application and Exhibit B and C be
treated as confidential for a period often years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary
nature of the information in Exhibits B and C.

9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT BIu1P BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER
ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.~a
The information concerns BIuIP's proprietary network information, related to current and planned
commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
