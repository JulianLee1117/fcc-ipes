Re: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of EdgeTel, LLC; Application
of EdgeTel, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources, WC
Docket No. 18-__
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, EdgeTel, LLC (“EdgeTel”),
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via first-class mail.
EdgeTel respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant
confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a document that contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”).1 EdgeTel is voluntarily providing this information, “of a kind that would customarily
not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under FOIA.2
Moreover, EdgeTel would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 EdgeTel
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
EdgeTel seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of EdgeTel’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules, EdgeTel is submitting the agreement between it and its carrier partner as
Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which EdgeTel seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8 Exhibit A describes the
agreement between EdgeTel and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning the operations and pricing of EdgeTel’s carrier partner and EdgeTel’s
network, services, and operating costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS
A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to EdgeTel’s disadvantage. EdgeTel has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by EdgeTel could compromise EdgeTel’s position in this highly
competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to EdgeTel.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use EdgeTel’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
EdgeTel’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how EdgeTel
provides services as well as about EdgeTel’s commercial agreements with others in the market
that are not normally disclosed to the public.
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).

7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).

6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY
TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
EdgeTel has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
EdgeTel has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A to the public or to third
parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY
ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE.13
EdgeTel requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period
is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT EDGETEL BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED.14
The information concerns EdgeTel’s proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is commercially sensitive.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at

PREFACE
This Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective as of May 27, 2014 (the “Effective
Date”), between Wide Voice, LLC (“Wide Voice”), a limited liability company organized under the
laws of the State of Nevada, with offices at 410 South Rampart, Suite 390, Las Vegas, NV 89145
and Verizon New Jersey Inc. (“Verizon”), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
New Jersey with offices at 540 Broad Street, Newark, NJ 07102 (Verizon and Wide Voice may
be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a “Party”, and, collectively, as the “Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and Wide Voice hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and Wide Voice.

and on or before the proposed date of termination either Wide Voice or Verizon
has requested negotiation of a new interconnection agreement, unless this

(including, but not limited to, pursuant to Section 12), this Agreement shall
remain in effect until the earlier of: (a) the effective date of a new interconnection
agreement between Wide Voice and Verizon; or, (b) the date one (1) year after
the proposed date of termination.

Patrick J. Chicas
President
Wide Voice, LLC
410 South Rampart
Suite 390
Las Vegas, NV 89145
Re: Requested Adoption Under Section 252(i) of the Communications Act
Dear Mr. Chicas:
Verizon New York Inc. (“Verizon”), a New York corporation, with principal place of business at
140 West Street, New York, NY 10007, has received correspondence stating that Wide Voice,
LLC (“WID”), a Nevada limited liability company, with principal place of business at 410 South
Rampart, Suite 390, Las Vegas, Nevada 89145 wishes, pursuant to Section 252(i) of the
Communications Act, to adopt the terms of the Interconnection Agreement between Cincinnati
Bell Any Distance Inc. (“CBAD”) and Verizon that was approved by the New York State Public
Service Commission (the “Commission”) as an effective agreement in the State of New York, as
such agreement exists on the date hereof (including, without limitation, Amendment 1 thereto)
after giving effect to operation of law (the “Terms”). I understand WID has a copy of the Terms.
Please note the following with respect to WID’s adoption of the Terms.
1. By WID’s countersignature on this letter, WID hereby represents and agrees to the
following seven points:
A. WID adopts (and agrees to be bound by) the Terms and, in applying the Terms,
agrees that WID shall be substituted in place of Cincinnati Bell Any Distance Inc.
and CBAD in the Terms wherever appropriate.
B. For the avoidance of any doubt, adoption of the Terms does not include adoption
of any provision imposing an unbundling obligation on Verizon (i) that no longer
WID NY Comp v113010 1

PUBLIC VERSION
Appendix A hereto) shall apply to WID’s adoption of the Terms; provided,
however, that if the Terms memorialize acceptance of Verizon’s offer of an
optional reciprocal compensation rate plan for non-Internet traffic subject to
Section 251(b)(5) pursuant to the industry letter described in footnote 2 of this
Letter, then the optional reciprocal compensation rate plan in the Terms shall
apply to this adoption instead of the reciprocal compensation rates set forth in
Appendix A. WID should note that the aforementioned pricing schedule may
contain rates for certain services the terms for which are not included in the
Terms or that are otherwise not part of this adoption, and may include phrases or
wording not identical to those utilized in the Terms. In an effort to expedite the
adoption process, Verizon has not deleted such rates from the pricing schedule
or attempted to customize the wording in the pricing schedule to match the
Terms. However, the inclusion of such rates in no way obligates Verizon to
provide the subject services and in no way waives Verizon’s rights, and the use
of different wording or phrasing in the pricing schedule does not alter the
obligations and rights set forth in the Terms.
G. WID's adoption of the Terms shall become effective on February 6, 2012.
Verizon shall file this adoption letter with the Commission promptly upon receipt
of an original of this letter countersigned by WID as to the points set out in
Paragraph One hereof. The term and termination provisions of the Terms shall
govern WID’s adoption of the Terms. The adoption of the Terms is currently
scheduled to expire on November 28, 2012.
2. As the Terms are being adopted by WID pursuant to Section 252(i) of the Act, Verizon
does not provide the Terms to you as either a voluntary or negotiated agreement. The
filing and performance by Verizon of the Terms does not in any way constitute a waiver
by Verizon of any position as to the Terms or a portion thereof, nor does it constitute a
waiver by Verizon of all rights and remedies it may have to seek review of the Terms, or
to seek review in any way of any provisions included in the Terms as a result of WID’s
adoption of the Terms.
3. Nothing herein shall be construed as or is intended to be a concession or admission by
Verizon that any provision in the Terms complies with the rights and duties imposed by
the Act, the decisions of the FCC and the Commission, the decisions of the courts, or
other law, and Verizon expressly reserves its full right to assert and pursue claims arising
from or related to the Terms.
4. Verizon reserves the right to deny WID’s application of the Terms, in whole or in part, at
any time:
A. when the costs of providing the Terms to WID are greater than the costs of
providing them to CBAD;
B. if the provision of the Terms to WID is not technically feasible; and/or
C. to the extent that Verizon otherwise is not required to make the Terms available
to WID under applicable law.
5. For the avoidance of any doubt, please note that adoption of the Terms will not result in
reciprocal compensation payments for Internet traffic. Verizon has always taken the
position that reciprocal compensation was not due to be paid for Internet traffic under
section 251(b)(5) of the Act. Verizon’s position that reciprocal compensation is not to be
