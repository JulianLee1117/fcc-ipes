RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Skye Telecom, LLC; Application
of Skye Telecom, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources,
WC Docket No. 20-__
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Skye Telecom, LLC (“Skyetel”),
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via FedEx. Skyetel respectfully
requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and
0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a
document that contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4
of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 Skyetel is voluntarily providing this information, “of a
kind that would customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential”
under FOIA.2 Moreover, Skyetel would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 Skyetel
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
Skyetel seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of Skyetel’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules, Skyetel is submitting the agreement between it and its carrier partner as
Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which Skyetel seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8 Exhibit A describes the
agreement between Skyetel and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning the operations and pricing of Skyetel’s carrier partner and Skyetel’s
network, services, and operating costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS
A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Skyetel’s disadvantage. Skyetel has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by Skyetel could compromise Skyetel’s position in this highly
competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Skyetel.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use Skyetel’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
Skyetel’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how Skyetel

provides services as well as about Skyetel’s commercial agreements with others in the market
that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY
TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Skyetel has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
Skyetel has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A to the public or to third
parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY
ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE.13
Skyetel requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period
is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT SKYETEL BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED.14
The information concerns Skyetel’s proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is commercially sensitive.

AMENDED, EXTENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT
PREFACE
This Amended, Extended and Restated Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective
upon Commission approval pursuant to Section 252 of the Act (the “Effective Date”), between
Onvoy, LLC (“Onvoy”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of
Minnesota, with offices at 10300 6th Avenue North, Plymouth, MN 55441 and Frontier

Delaware (“Frontier”) with offices at 401 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT 06851, (Frontier and Onvoy may
be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a “Party”, and, collectively, as the “Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Frontier and Onvoy hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Frontier expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Frontier and Onvoy.

Ronald Gavillet
EVP & General Counsel
Neutral Tandem-New York, LLC
2 North LaSalle Street
Chicago, YL 60602
Re: Requested Adoption Under Section 252(i) of the TA96
Dear Mr. Gavillet:
Verizon New York Inc. ("Verizon"), a New York corporation, with principal place of
business at 1095 Avenue of The Americas, New York, New York 10036, has received
your letter stating that, under Section 252(i) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the
"Act"), Neutral Tandem-New York, LLC ("NTI"), a Delaware limited liability
corporation, with principal place of business at 2 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1615,
Chicago, Illinois 60602, wishes to adopt the terms of the arbitrated Interconnection
Agreement between AT&T Communications of New York Inc. ("AT&T") and Verizon
that was approved by the New York Public Service Commission (the "Commission") as
an effective agreement in the State of New York in Docket No. Ol-C-0095, as such
agreement exists on the date hereof after giving effect to operation of law (the "Terms").
I understand NTI has a copy of the Terms. Please note the following with respect to
NTI's adoption of the Terms.
1. By NTI's countersignature on this letter, NTI hereby represents and agrees to the
following five points:
(A) NTI adopts (and agrees to be bound by) the Terms of the AT&T/Verizon
arbitrated agreement for interconnection as it is in effect on the date hereof
after giving effect to operation of law, and in applying the Terms, agrees that
NTI NY 252S1A 031904.DOC

PUBLIC VERSION
NTI shall be substituted in place of AT&T Communications of New York Inc.
and AT&T in the Terms wherever appropriate.
(B) For avoidance of doubt, adoption of the Terms does not include adoption of
any provision imposing an unbundling obligation on Verizon that no longer
applies under the Report and Order and Order on Remand (FCC 03-36)
released by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") on August 21,
2003 in CC Docket Nos. 01-338, 96-98, 98-147 ("Triennial Review Order"),
or that is otherwise not required by both 47 U.S.C. Section 251(c)(3) and 47
C.F.R. Part 51. Moreover, Verizon, on March 10, 2004, filed a petition at the
New York Public Service Commission to arbitrate amendments to
interconnection agreements (including the Terms) with respect to the
Triennial Review Order ("TRO Arbitration"). Once the Commission issues an
effective order approving an amendment with respect to the Triennial Review
Order in the TRO Arbitration (an "Approved Amendment"): 1) the terms of
such Approved Amendment shall be deemed to amend this adoption effective
on the effective date of such Commission order, 2) NTI agrees to be bound by
the terms of such Approved Amendment effective on the effective date of
such Commission order, and 3) Verizon and NTI shall execute an amendment
to this adoption to memorialize that this adoption is amended by the terms of
such Approved Amendment effective on the effective date of such
Commission order; provided, however, failure by either party to do so shall
not be cited as a basis for contesting the effectiveness of the provisions in 1)
and 2) above.
(C) Notice to NTI and Verizon as may be required under the Terms shall be
provided as follows:

Suite 500
Arlington, VA 22201
Facsimile: 703-351-3664
(D) NTI represents and warrants that it is a certified provider of local
telecommunications service in the State of New York, and that its
adoption of the Terms will cover services in the State of New York only.
(E) In the event an interconnection agreement between Verizon and NTI is
currently in effect in the State of New York (the "Original ICA"), this
adoption shall be an amendment and restatement of the operating terms
and conditions of the Original ICA, and shall replace in their entirety the
terms of the Original ICA. This adoption is not intended to be, nor shall it
be construed to create, a novation or accord and satisfaction with respect
to the Original ICA. Any outstanding payment obligations of the parties
that were incurred but not fully performed under the Original ICA shall
constitute payment obligations of the parties under this adoption.
(F) Verizon's standard pricing schedule for interconnection agreements in the
State of New York (as such schedule may be amended from time to time)
(attached as Appendix 1 hereto) shall apply to NTI's adoption of the
Terms. NTI should note that the aforementioned pricing schedule may
contain rates for certain services the terms for which are not included in
the Terms or that are otherwise not part of this adoption, and may include
phrases or wording not identical to those utilized in the Terms. In an
effort to expedite the adoption process, Verizon has not deleted such rates
from the pricing schedule or attempted to customize the wording in the
pricing schedule to match the Terms. However, the inclusion of such rates
in no way obligates Verizon to provide the subject services and in no way
waives Verizon's rights, and the use of slightly different wording or
phrasing in the pricing schedule does not alter the obligations and rights
set forth in the Terms.
2. NTI's adoption of the AT&T arbitrated Terms shall become effective as of
May 3, 2004. The Parties understand and agree that Verizon will file this
adoption letter with the Commission promptly upon my receipt of a copy of this
letter, countersigned by NTI as to points (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F) of
paragraph 1 above. The term and termination provisions of the AT&T/Verizon
agreement shall govern NTI's adoption of the Terms. The adoption of the Terms
is currently scheduled to expire on June 23, 2005.
NTI NY 252S1A 031904.DOC

PUBLIC VERSION
3. As the Terms are being adopted by you pursuant to your statutory rights under
section 252(i), Verizon does not provide the Terms to you as either a voluntary or
negotiated agreement. The filing and performance by Verizon of the Terms does
not in any way constitute a waiver by Verizon of any position as to the Terms or a
portion thereof, nor does it constitute a waiver by Verizon of all rights and
remedies it may have to seek review of the Terms, or to petition the Commission,
other administrative body, or court for reconsideration or reversal of any
determination made by the Commission pursuant to arbitration in Docket No. 01-
C-0095, or to seek review in any way of any provisions included in these Terms
as a result of NTT s 252(i) election.
4. Nothing herein shall be construed as or is intended to be a concession or admission
by Verizon that any contractual provision required by the Commission in Docket
No. 01-C-0095 (the AT&T arbitration) or any provision in the Terms complies with
the rights and duties imposed by the Act, the decisions of the FCC and the
Commissions, the decisions of the courts, or other law, and Verizon expressly
reserves its full right to assert and pursue claims arising from or related to the
Terms.
5. Verizon reserves the right to deny NTI's adoption and/or application of the
Terms, in whole or in part, at any time:
(a) when the costs of providing the Terms to NTI are greater than the costs of
providing them to AT&T;
(b) if the provision of the Terms to NTI is not technically feasible; and/or
(c) to the extent that Verizon otherwise is not required to make the Terms
available to NTI under applicable law.
6. For avoidance of doubt, please note that adoption of the Terms will not result in
reciprocal compensation payments for Internet traffic. Verizon has always taken
the position that reciprocal compensation was not due to be paid for Internet
traffic under section 251(b)(5) of the Act. Verizon's position that reciprocal
compensation is not to be paid for Internet traffic was confirmed by the FCC in
the Order on Remand and Report and Order adopted on April 18, 2001 ("FCC
Internet Order"), which held that Internet traffic constitutes "information access"
outside the scope of the reciprocal compensation obligations set forth in section
251(b)(5) of the Act.' Accordingly, any compensation to be paid for Internet
traffic will be handled pursuant to the terms of the FCC Internet Order, not
pursuant to adoption of the Terms.2 Moreover, in light of the FCC Internet
Order on Remand and Report and Order, In the Matters of: Implementation of the Local Competition
Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic,
CC Docket No. 99-68 (rel. April 27, 2001) ("FCC Remand Order") f44, remanded, WorldCom, Inc. v.
FCC, No. 01-1218 (DC Cir. May 3, 2002). Although the D.C. Circuit remanded the FCC Remand Order
to permit the FCC to clarify its reasoning, it left the order in place as governing federal law. See
WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 01-1218, slip op. at 5 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2002).

Internet Order can be viewed at Verizon's Customer Support Website at URL www.verizon.com/wise

PUBLIC VERSION
Order, even if the Terms include provisions invoking an intercarrier
compensation mechanism for Internet traffic, any reasonable amount of time
permitted for adopting such provisions has expired under the FCC's rules
implementing section 252(i) of the Act.3 In fact, the FCC Internet Order made
clear that carriers may not adopt provisions of an existing interconnection
agreement to the extent that such provisions provide compensation for Internet
traffic.4
7. Should NTI attempt to apply the Terms in a manner that conflicts with paragraphs
3-6 above, Verizon reserves its rights to seek appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief.
8. In the event that a voluntary or involuntary petition has been or is in the future
filed against NTI under bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or any law relating to the
relief of debtors, readjustment of indebtedness, debtor reorganization or
composition or extension of debt (any such proceeding, an "Insolvency
Proceeding"), then: (i) all rights of Verizon under such laws, including, without
limitation, all rights of Verizon under 11 U.S.C. § 366, shall be preserved, and
NTI's adoption of the Verizon Terms shall in no way impair such rights of
Verizon; and (ii) all rights of NTI resulting from NTI's adoption of the Verizon
terms shall be subject to and modified by any Stipulations and Orders entered in
the Insolvency Proceeding, including, without limitation, any Stipulation or Order
providing adequate assurance of payment to Verizon pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 366.

22.1 This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first above written and,
unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, shall continue in effect
until June 23, 2005 (the "Initial Term"), and thereafter the Agreement shall continue in
force and effect on a month-to-month basis unless and until terminated as provided
herein.

22.3 Either AT&T or Verizon may terminate this Agreement, effective upon
the expiration of the Initial Term or effective upon any date after expiration of the Initial
Term, by providing written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days, but not greater
than nine (9) months, in advance of the date of termination. In the event of such
termination, if neither Party has requested renegotiation of a successor interconnection
agreement pursuant to Section 22.4, the service arrangements made available under this
Agreement and existing at the time of termination shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, continue without interruption under (a) standard Interconnection terms and
conditions approved and made generally effective by the Commission, (b) Tariff terms
and conditions generally available to CLECs or (c) if none of the above is available,

terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 251(c)(1) of the Act ("Request for
Renegotiation"). The date of receipt of such Request for Renegotiation shall be the
"Renegotiation Request Date". Any such Request for Renegotiation shall be deemed by
both Parties to be notice of termination of this Agreement and a good faith request for
Interconnection pursuant to Section 252 of the Act (or any successor provision). The
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in effect during the period of
renegotiations; provided, however, if the Parties do not execute a new interconnection
agreement within one hundred and sixty (160) days after the Renegotiation Request Date,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect only if

Re; Requested Adoption of Interconnection Agreement under Section 252(i^ of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996
Dear Mr. Bullock,
Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. ("HT"). has received a letter from Scott Kellogg, Counsel to Neutral Tandem-
Hawaii, LLC, stating that, under Section 252(1) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "Act"), Neutral
Tandem-Hawaii, LLC ("Neutral") wishes to adopt the terms of the Amended, Extended and Restated
Agreement between Wavecom Solutions Corporation ("Wavecom"), f/Wa Pacific Lightnet, Inc. ("PLNI")
and Hawaiian Telcom Inc., with an effective date of June 20, 2007, that was approved by the Hawaii
Public Utilities Commission (the "Commission") as an effective agreement in the State of Hawaii, as such
agreement exists on the date hereof after giving effect to operation of law (the "Terms"). I understand
Neutral has a copy of the Terms. Please note the following with respect to Neutrat's adoption of the
Terms.
1. By Neutrat's countersignature on this letter. Neutral hereby represents and agrees to the following
three points:
(A) Neutral adopts (and agrees to be bound by) the Temis of the Wavecom/HT agreement for
interconnection as it is in effect on the date hereof after giving effect to operation of law, and in applying
the Terms, agrees that Neutral shall be substituted in place of Wavecom in the Temns wherever
appropriate.

(C) Neutral represents and warrants that it is a certified provider of local telecommunications service
in the State of Hawaii, and that its adoption ofthe Terms will cover services in the State of Hawaii only.
2. Neutral's adoption of the Wavecom Terms shall become effective on November 1, 2013 and is
subject to regulatory approval. HT shall file this adoption letter with the Commission promptly upon receipt
of an original of this letter countersigned by an authorized officer of Neutral. The term and termination
provisions of the Wavecom/HT agreement shall govern Neutral's adoption of the Terms. The adoption of
(and agreement to be bound by) the Terms is currently scheduled to expire on October 31, 2014.
3. As the Terms are being adopted by you pursuant to your statutory rights under section 252(i), HT
does not provide the Terms to you as either a voluntary or negotiated agreement. The filing and
performance by HT of the Terms does not in any way constitute a waiver by HT of any position as to the
Terms or a portion thereof, nor does it constitute a waiver by HT of atl rights and remedies it may have to
seek review of the Terms, or to seek review in any way of any provisions included in these Terms as a
result of Neutral's 252(1) election.
4. On January 25.1999, the Supreme Court of the United States ("Court") issued its decision on the
appeals of the Eighth Circuit's decision in Iowa Utilities Board. Specifically, the Supreme Court modified
several of the FCC's and the Eighth Circuit's rulings regarding unbundled network elements and pricing
requirements under the Act AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Board, 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999). Certain
provisions of the Terms may be void or unenforceable as a result of the Court's decision of January 25,
1999, theUnitedStatesEighthCircuitCourtof Appeals'decision in Docket No. 96-3321 regarding the
FCC's pricing rules, and the cun'ent appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the FCC's new UNE
rules. Moreover, nothing herein shall be construed as or Is intended to be a concession or admission by

HT that any provision in the Terms complies with the rights and duties Imposed by the Act, the decisions
of the FCC and the Commissions, the decisions of the courts, or other law, and HT expressly reserves its
full right to assert and pursue claims arising from or related to the Terms.
5. HT reserves the right to deny Neutral's adoption and/or application of the Terms, in whole or in
part, at any time:
(a) when the costs of providing the Temis to Neutral are greater than the costs of providing them to
Wavecom;
(b) If the provision of the Terms to Neutral is not technically feasible; and/or
(c) to the extent that HT otherwise is not required to make the Temns available to Neutral under
applicable law.
6. For avoidance of doubt, please note that adoption of the Terms will not result in reciprocal
compensation payments for Internet traffic. HT has always taken the position that reciprocal
compensation was not due to be paid for Internet traffic under section 251 (b) (5) of the Act HT's position
that reciprocal compensation is not to be paid for Internet traffic was confirmed by the FCC in the Order
on Remand and Report and Order adopted on April 18, 2001 ("FCC Internet Order"), which held that
Intemet traffic constitutes "information access' outside the scope of the reciprocal compensation
obligations set forth in section 251(b) (5) of the Act. Accordingly, any compensation to be paid for
Intemet traffic will be handled pursuant to the terms of the FCC Internet Order, not pursuant to adoption
of the Terms. Moreover, in light of the FCC Intemet Order, even if the Terms include provisions invoking
an intercamer compensation mechanism for Intemet traffic, any reasonable amount of time permitted for
adopting such provisions has expired under the FCC's rules implementing section 252(1) of the Act. In
fact, the FCC Internet Order made clear that carriers may not adopt provisions of an existing
interconnection agreement to the extent that such provisions provide compensation for Intemet traffic.
7. WHEREAS, the Federal Communications Commission released its USF/ICC Transformation Order,
FCC 11-161 (Nov. 18, 2011), which among other things substantially changes the rules governing the
exchange of telecommunications traffic between CLECs and local exchange carriers, including Neutral
and HT, and the Parties desire to confonm their interconnection and traffic exchange arrangements to the
new rules therein established. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the existing or amended Terms to
the contrary, the Parties shall exchange all Reciprocal Compensation Traffic as defined in Section 7 of
the Interconnection Attachment of the Terms at bill-and-keep (that is, at a zero Intercarrier compensation
rate for traffic in either direction between the parties).
8. Should Neutral attempt to apply the Terms in a manner that conflicts with paragraphs 3-7 above,
HT reserves its rights to seek appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.
9. tn the event that a voluntary or involuntary petition has been or is in the future filed against
Neutral under bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or any law relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of
indebtedness, debtor reorganization or composition or extension of debt (any such proceeding, an
"Insolvency Proceeding"), then: (i) all rights of HT under such laws, including, without limitation, all rights
of HT under 11 U.S.C. § 366, shall be preserved, and Neutral's adoption of the HT Terms shall in no way
impair such rights of HT: and (ii) all rights of Neutral resulting from Neutral's adoption of the HT tenms
shall be subject to and modified by any Stipulations and Orders entered in the Insolvency Proceeding,
including, without limitation, any Stipulation or Order providing adequate assurance of payment to HT
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §366.

1. By Neutral Tandem's countersignature on this letter, Neutral Tandem
hereby represents and agrees to the following seven points:
A. Neutral Tandem adopts (and agrees to be bound by) the Terms
and, in applying the Terms, agrees that Neutral Tandem shall be
substituted in place of US LEC of Florida Inc. and US LEC in the
Terms wherever appropriate.
For the avoidance of any doubt, adoption ofthe Terms does not
include adoption ofany provision imposing an unbundling obligation
on Verizon (i)that no longer applies to Verizon under the Report
and Order and Order on Remand (FCC 03-36)released by the
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC")on August 21,2003
in CC Docket Nos. 01-338,96-98,98-147 ("Triennial Review

"TRO Remand Order" ),or (ii) that is otherwise not required by 47
U. S.C.Section 251(c)(3)or by 47 C.F.R.Part 51. Moreover,
Verizon, on February 20, 2004, filed a petition at the Commission to
arbitrate amendments to interconnection agreements (including the
Terms) with respect to the Triennial Review Order ("TRO
