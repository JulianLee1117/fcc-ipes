Re: Relinquishment of Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Held by
Flowroute Inc.; WC Docket No. 16-265
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Flowroute Inc. (“Flowroute”), through its undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully
notifies the Commission that it relinquishes its authorization to obtain numbering resources from
the Numbering Administrator as an interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”)
provider.1 This authorization is no longer required as a result of a transaction whereby
Flowroute Inc. was merged into West Telecom Services Holdings, LLC (“West Holdings”). The
transaction was consummated effective February 1, 2019. As a result of the transaction,
Flowroute was dissolved as a legal entity, and West Holdings was the surviving company.
The numbers held by Flowroute Inc. were transferred to West Telecom Services, LLC
(“West Telecom”), a subsidiary of West Holdings, as part of a post-merger asset transfer. West
Telecom holds authorization to obtain numbering resources from the Numbering Administrator
as a common carrier pursuant to the Commission’s rules.
Flowroute understands that Commission approval is not required to surrender such
authorization. Accordingly, Flowroute submits this letter for informational purposes to ensure
the accuracy of the Commission’s records.
1 Flowroute was granted authorization to obtain numbering resources on October 17, 2016. Notice of
Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Granted, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 11681 (2016); see
also Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Application Filed by Flowroute Inc. Pursuant to
Section 52.15(g)(3) of the Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 16-265 (filed Aug. 15, 2016).

If you have any questions regarding this notification, please contact the undersigned.
Respectfully submitted,
