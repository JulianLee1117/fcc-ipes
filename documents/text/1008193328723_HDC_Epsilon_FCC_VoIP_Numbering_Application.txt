DearSecretary:

commercial information that falls within Exemption 4ofthe Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").l HOC
Epsilon isvoluntarily providingthis information, "ofakind that would notcustomarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, HOC Epsilon would suffer
substantial competitive harm ifthis informationwere disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
