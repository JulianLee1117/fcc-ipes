2. Description of the circumstances giving rise to the submission.
As part of its Application, PanTerra is including the agreements between its carrier
partners as proof of its facilities readiness as required by §52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s Rules, and copies of a number of the carriers’ interconnection agreements
with incumbent carriers.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
The information for which PanTerra seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors. The
Exhibits to this Application describes the agreements between PanTerra and its carrier
partners and contains proprietary commercial information concerning PanTerra’s network,
customers, financing, and services.
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
The Exhibits contain information relating to commercial matters which can be used by
other interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) providers to compromise
PanTerra’s position in the highly competitive interconnected VoIP sector. Accordingly,
release of this information would result in substantial competitive harm to PanTerra.
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial competitive
harm.
Competitors could use PanTerra’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
PanTerera’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning
PanTerra’s commercial agreements, as well as information as to how PanTerra provides
its services. This information is not typically disclosed publicly.
6. Identification of any measures taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure, or if the
information has been disclosed previously.
Neither PanTerra nor its carrier-partners have distributed the information to the public or
to any third party.
7. Justification of the period during which PanTerra asserts that material should not be
available for public disclosure.
PanTerra requests that the Exhibits be treated as confidential for a minimum period of ten
years. This period is necessary due to the nature of the proprietary information in the
Exhibits of the Application.
