Petition seeking approval of the Agreement The Commission ·published notice of the
Joint Petitio~ and the Agreement in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on November 17, 2007,

Agreement at 2.
In the Joint Petition before us, Verizon is the Incumbent Local Exchange •
· Carrier (ILEC) and Neutral Tandem is certified to provide facilities-based and resold
local exchange services as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC)..1
Discussion
A. Standard of Review
The Commission~s standard of review of a negotiated interconnection
-agreement is set out in Section 252(e)(2) ofTA-96, 47 U.S.C § 252(e)(2), which
provides, in 'pertinent part, that:
·It is noted that regardless of the types of services· covered by this
i .
Interconnectien Agreement, it would be a violation of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.
C.S. §§ 101 et seq.~ if Neutral Tandem began offering services or assessing surcharges to
end users which it has not been authorized to provide and for which tariffs have not been •
authorized.

,,,,,. t ..
•
(2) Grounds for rejection. The state Commission may only reject -
(A) an agreement (or any portion thereot) adopted by
negotiation under subsection (a) ifi t finds-
(i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminated
against a telecommunications carrier not a party
to the agreement; or
(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion
is not consistent with the public interest, convenience
and necessity .. ..
With these criteria in mind, we shall review the Agreement submitted by Verizon and
Neutral Tandem.
B. Summary of Terms
•
The Agreement contains the terms, rates and conditions for the
interconnection of the Parties' local exchange networks, for the purpose of transmission
and termination of calls, so that customers of each can receive calls that originate on the
other's network and place calls that terminate on the other's network, as well as Neutral
Tandem's purchase of telecommunication services for resale to others. The Parties agree
that the charges for a specific service shall be the charges for the service as stated in the
providing party's applicable tariff. Pricing Attachment at 123. The Discount Resale Rate
for the resale of retail service is 22.00 percent, ifN eutral Tandem provides its own
operator services platform, and 18.34 percentifNeutral Tandem uses Verizon's operator
services platform. Appendix A to the Pricing Attachment at 135.
Reciprocal Compensation Rates for traffic termination are as follows: the
rate for traffic to an end office is $0.000987 per nrinute of use (MOU); and the rate for
• tandem traffic is $0.002439 per MOU. Appendix A to the Pricing Attachment at 127.

t •
•
The Parties also agree to provide Number Portability (NP) in accordance
with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC); and to follow the Local Number Portability (LPN} provisioning process
recommended by the North American Numbering Council (NANC) and the Industry
Numbering Council (lNC), and adopted by the FCC. Local Number Portability will be
provided on a reciprocal basis. Agreement at 76-78.
C. Disposition
We shall approve the Agree~ent, finding that it satisfies the two-pronged
criteria of Section 252(e ) of TA-96. We note that in appro.ving this privately negotiated
Agreement, including any provisions limiting unbundled access to Verizon's network, we
ezj>re8s no opinion regarding the enforceability of our independent state authority
preserved by 47 U.S.C. § 251(d)(3) and any other applicable law. •
· We shall minimize the potential for discrimination against other carriers not
parties to the Agreement by providing here that our approval of this Agreement shall not
serve as precedent for agreements to ~e negotiated or arbitrated by other parties. This is
consistent with our policy of encouraging settlements. 52 Pa. Code § S.231; see also,
52 Pa. Code ~ 6~.401,. et seq., relating to settlement guidelines, and our Statement of
. ..
Policy relating to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Process, 52 Pa. Code § 69.391, et
seq. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agreement does not discriminate against
telecoUllllunications carriers not parties to the negotiations.
be
TA-96 requires that the terms of the Agreement made available for other
parties to review. 47 U.S.C. § 252(h). However, this availability is only for purposes of
•
full disclOsute of the terms and arrangements contained therein. The accessibility of the
Agreement and its terms to ·other parties does not connote any intent that our approval
4 .

' . '·1 • 111) •
•
will affect the status of negotiations between other parties. In this context, we will not
require Verizon and Neutral Tandem to embody the terms of the Agreement in a filed
tariff.
With regard to the public inter~t element of this matter, we note that no
negotiated interconnection agreement may affect those obligations of the ILEC in the
areas of protection of public safety and welfare, service quality, and the rights of
consumers. See, e.g., Section 253(b) ofTA-96. This is consistent with TA-96 wherein
service quality and standards, i.e., Unive~al Service, 911, Enhanced 91 l(E911), and
Telecommunications Relay Service, are inherent obligations of the ILEC and
continu~
unaffected by a negotiated agreement. We have reviewed the Agreement's terms relating
to 911 and E91 l services, and conclude that these provisions of the instant Agreement are
consistent with the public interest.
•
Consistent with our May 3, 2004 Order at Docket No. M-00960799, we
will require that Verizon file an electronic, true and correct copy of the Interconnection
Agreement in ".pelf format'' for inclusion on the Commission's website, within thirty
days of the date of entry of this Opinion and Order.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing and pursuant to Section 252( e) of TA-96, supra,
and our Implementation Orders, we determine that the Interconnection Agreement
between Verizon and Neutral Tandem is non-discriminatory to other telecommunications
companies not parties to it and that it is consistent with the public interest;
