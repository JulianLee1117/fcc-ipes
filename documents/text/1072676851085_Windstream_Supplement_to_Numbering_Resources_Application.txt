Re: PAETEC iTEL, L.L.C.’s Restated Application for Interconnected VoIP
Numbering Authorization
WC Docket No. 20-416
Dear Ms. Dortch:
On behalf of PAETEC iTEL, L.L.C. (“Windstream IPES”), we provide this supplemental
information relevant to the Restated Application for Interconnected VoIP Numbering
Authorization (“Restated Application”) filed by Windstream IPES in the abovementioned
docket.1 We provide this information at the request of Commission staff to update information
regarding the Robocall Mitigation Database (“RMD”) and Windstream IPES’s indirect foreign
ownership.
RMD Filing
Commission staff asked Windstream IPES to provide an update regarding the status of its
filing in the RMD. As stated in the Restated Application, Windstream IPES’ ultimate parent
company, Windstream Holdings II, LLC (“Holdings II”), holds its interest in Windstream IPES
through a vertical chain of several wholly-owned subsidiary companies that are U.S. domestic
entities, including Windstream Communications, LLC (“Windstream Communications”).2 On
July 6, 2023, Windstream Communications updated its RMD filing for itself and all of its
subsidiaries, including Windstream IPES, stating that Windstream IPES and its affiliates have

fully implemented the STIR/SHAKEN framework across their entire networks.3 A copy of the
attachment submitted with the certification is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and specifically lists
PAETEC iTEL, L.L.C., FRN 0015247810, as compliant.
Ownership Information
Commission staff asked Windstream IPES to update the ownership information provided
in the Restated Application.4 The Restated Application noted that, when it was filed, Holdings II
had filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling (“Petition”) to permit foreign investors to own up to
100% of equity and voting interests in Holdings II, and that the Petition was then under review
by the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States
Telecommunications Services Sector (“Team Telecom”).5 On January 18, 2023, Holdings II
entered into a Letter of Agreement (“LOA”) with certain Team Telecom agencies, concluding
the national security review of Holdings II’s foreign ownership and its subsidiaries’ operations.6
The International Bureau granted the Petition on June 2, 2023.7
Today, the foreign ownership of Holdings II, and thus the indirect foreign ownership of
Windstream IPES, remains the same as Holdings II disclosed to the Commission in the Petition,
as amended and supplemented, and finally approved by the International Bureau.8 Holdings II
has committed to the Commission that it will monitor its ownership, file annual certifications as
to continuing compliance, and notifications within fifteen calendar days should it discover non-
compliance.9
Referral to Team Telecom Not Required
To the extent Commission staff may consider a petition for access to numbering
resources to be referable to Team Telecom, the instant application should be excluded from any
such referral. The Commission stated that it would exclude international Section 214
applications from referral to Team Telecom “where the applicant has an existing mitigation
agreement, there are no new reportable foreign owners of the applicant since the effective date of

the mitigation agreement, and the applicant agrees to continue to comply with the terms of that
mitigation agreement . . . .”10
Assuming these same criteria would apply to requests for direct access to numbering
resources, then this request should be excluded: Windstream IPES is fully subject to the LOA
with Team Telecom; there are no new reportable foreign owners since the effective date of the
LOA; and Windstream IPES agrees to continue to comply with the terms of the LOA.

questions about this filing, please do not hesitate to reach us by email or telephone.

Robocall Mitigation Database Certification Attachment
This filing is made by Windstream Holdings II, LLC on behalf of itself and its operating
subsidiaries identified in Attachment A (collectively “Windstream”) in compliance with the FCC’s
Sixth Report and Order and Fifth Report and Order (Gateway Provider Order) in the Advanced
Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls, Call Authentication Trust Anchor dockets.
1. Specific reasonable steps Windstream has taken to avoid carrying or processing illegal
robocall traffic:
Windstream has taken significant steps to avoid carrying or processing illegal traffic.
Windstream serves as a gateway provider in only a small portion of its total network traffic. The
vast majority of Windstream call traffic originates and terminates domestically.
Using reasonable analytics, Windstream employs a rigorous process for manually blocking
calls originating on its network that are suspected to be spam, robocalls, or otherwise fraudulent.
Windstream continues to participate in the FCC-sponsored Industry Traceback Group and remains
engaged at both the federal and state levels of robocall policymaking.
For calls originated by its wholesale customers, Windstream blocks calls that can be identified
as coming from known scam-related inbound-only numbers (e.g., Internal Revenue Service
inbound, toll-free number). This currently is a manual process and is implemented as Windstream
becomes aware of abusers. Each day at 2PM EST, a report of the highest offending Automatic
1

Number Identifications (“ANIs”) for the previous 36 hours is generated. Windstream then uploads
those ANIs to its High Velocity, Short Duration (HVSD) database. Known legitimate numbers are
scrubbed from the report (i.e. known disaster/emergency services call centers). Windstream then
generates a Routing Block File and sends it to its internal Network Routing team for
implementation. The team performs final checks-and-balances and uploads to Windstream’s
routing platform.
In addition, Windstream has partnered with a major national vendor to utilize its
reputational database automated solution to identify calls as likely spam in the Caller ID service
for calls where the called party is a Windstream end-user (business or consumer).
Windstream also has several line-specific features which can assist customers with
blocking unwanted calls. These include:
Anonymous Call Rejection by which an incoming call will automatically be blocked if the
caller has blocked the Caller ID – i.e., blocked the display of the originating number. This feature
is automatically activated without charge on customer lines and may be deactivated by the
customer using *87.
Selective Call Acceptance which permits a customer to create a list of numbers that they
will accept calls from. This feature is free of charge and is accessible directly from the customer’s
phone by using the *64 feature.
2

Selective Call Rejection by which a customer can block calls from a specific number. This
feature is free of charge and is accessible directly from the customer’s phone by using the *60
feature.
Consumers who need additional assistance, may call 800-341-1991 or access information
on Windstream’s website at https://www.windstream.com/support/phone/Features-and-
Information-of-Local-Phone. Enterprise customers who need additional assistance, may call 800-
600-5050.
Windstream has implemented STIR/SHAKEN technology solutions on the IP portions of
its network and has met the FCC deadline for registration in the Robocall Mitigation Database.
Windstream is also monitoring and participating in industry working groups to address gaps in
existing STIR/SHAKEN standards.
Additionally, Windstream has deployed the Reputational Database/Spam Identification
Method (offered by a major provider of such services) which is the most current technology. The
FCC’s recent authorized permissive call-blocking with customer opt-out option is not currently
technically feasible and not available on a commercial basis. (Unintended blocking of large
volumes of legitimate calls, i.e., false positives, which presents a significant hurdle.) Nevertheless,
Windstream is actively monitoring and is an active industry participant in the development of call
blocking options.
Windstream is actively testing and monitoring development of non-IP technology solutions
for illegal and unwanted robocalls for future deployment.
2. 24 Hour Traceback Request Commitment
Windstream commits to responding fully and within 24 hours to all traceback requests from
the Commission, law enforcement, and the industry traceback consortium, and to cooperate with
3

such entities in investigating and stopping any illegal robocallers that use its service to carry or
process calls.
