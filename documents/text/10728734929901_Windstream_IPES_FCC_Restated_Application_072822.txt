0.457 and 0.459, Windstream IPES respectfully requests the Commission grant confidential
treatment to Exhibit A, which contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that

As proof of Windstream IPES facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D)
of the Commission’s rules, Windstream IPES is submitting the agreement between it and
its carrier partner as Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.5
The information for which Windstream IPES seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.6
Exhibit A is a copy of its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial information
concerning the operations and pricing of Windstream IPES’ carrier partner and
Windstream IPES’ network, services, and operating costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.7
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to Windstream IPES’ disadvantage. Windstream IPES has numerous
competitors in the Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it
operates. Detailed operations and commercial information of the type provided by
Windstream IPES could compromise Windstream IPES’ position in this highly competitive
industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Windstream
IPES.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.8
Competitors could use Windstream IPES’ proprietary commercial and operational
information to Windstream IPES’ detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information about how Windstream IPES provides services as well as about Windstream
IPES’ commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally disclosed to
the public.

THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.10

or to the third parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.11
Windstream IPES requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten
years. This period is necessary due to proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.

USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY

The information concerns Windstream IPES’ proprietary network information, related to

sensitive.

Communications Commission (the “Commission”) for authorization to acquire telephone numbers

(“Holdings II”) holds its interest in Windstream IPES through a vertical chain of several
wholly-owned subsidiary companies that are U.S. domestic entities. On August 28, 2020,
the FCC approved the transfer of control of Holdings II, which was simultaneously
converted from a corporation to a limited liability company, in connection with its
emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. See DA 20-985, WC Docket No. 20-
151 et al. (“Emergence Order”). The Emergence Order permitted the transfer of control to
occur in two steps. At the end of Step One, which occurred on September 21, 2020,
Holdings II’s equity ownership by non-U.S. holders is approximately 3.64%. The
Emergence Order permitted Holdings II and two of its direct investors to issue Special
Warrants to foreign investors. Pursuant to the Emergence Order, Holdings II was also
required to file within 30 days of emergence a Petition for Declaratory Ruling requesting a
waiver to exceed the 25% statutory foreign ownership benchmark, to secure specific
approval for a number of foreign entities to hold direct or indirect equity and voting
interests in Holdings II, and to have up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership. Holdings
II filed the required Petition for Declaratory Ruling on October 21, 2020, in IBFS File No.
ISP-PDR-20201021-00010, on March 18, 2022, the Commission issued a Public Notice on
the Petition and the matter is currently under review by Team Telecom. Step Two, the
exercise of the Special Warrants, will not be consummated until the Commission has
granted the requested Declaratory Ruling.
