Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc.; Application of IDT
Domestic Telecom, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section
52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 21-
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.l5(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc. ("IDT
Domestic Telecom") hereby submits its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
IDT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, IDT Domestic Telecom would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT -
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, IDT Domestic Telecom hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
IDT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
IDT Domestic Telecom is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as
proof of IDT Domestic Telecom's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of
the Commission's Rules.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for “trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”

3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which IDT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A
describes the agreement between IDT Domestic Telecom and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning IDT Domestic Telecom's network, customers,
and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoIP providers to compromise IDT Domestic Telecom’s position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by IDT Domestic Telecom could compromise IDT Domestic
Telecom's position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this information
would result in substantial competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use IDT Domestic Telecom's proprietary commercial and operational
information to IDT Domestic Telecom's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning IDT Domestic Telecom’s commercial agreements, as well as information
as to how IDT Domestic Telecom provides its services. The prices and terms for the provision of
such services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure
of the Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to IDT Domestic
Telecom’s carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
IDT Domestic Telecom has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; IDT
Domestic Telecom is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement,
except as expressly authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
IDT Domestic Telecom does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or
that the Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a
non-disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
IDT Domestic Telecom requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely.
IDT Domestic Telecom and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in
effect indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance
would cause competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom’s carrier partner regarding of the
timing of the disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT IDT DOMESTIC TELECOM BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns IDT Domestic Telecom's proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, IDT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be
granted confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3006 or
