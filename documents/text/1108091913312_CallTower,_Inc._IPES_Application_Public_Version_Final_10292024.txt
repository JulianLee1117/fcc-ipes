Re: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of CallTower, LLC.;
Application of CallTower, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources, WC Docket No. 20 -
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, CallTower, Inc. (“CallTower”),
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via first-class mail.
CallTower respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s
rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant
confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a document that contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”).1 CallTower, Inc. is voluntarily providing this information, “of a kind that would
customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under
FOIA.2 Moreover, CallTower would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 CallTower
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
CallTower, Inc. seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of CallTower’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of
the Commission’s rules, CallTower is submitting the agreement between it and its
carrier partner as Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL; OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which CallTower seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8
Exhibit A describes the agreement between CallTower and its carrier partner and
contains proprietary commercial information concerning the operations and pricing of
CallTower, Inc. ’s carrier partner and CallTower’s network, services, and operating
costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to CallTower’s disadvantage. CallTower has numerous competitors in the
Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed
operations and commercial information of the type provided by CallTower could
compromise CallTower’s position in this highly competitive industry. Release would
therefore result in substantial competitive harm to CallTower.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use CallTower’s proprietary commercial and operational information
to CallTower’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how
CallTower provides services as well as about CallTower’s commercial agreements with
others in the market that are not normally disclosed to the public.

third parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
CallTower requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years.
This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CallTower, Inc. BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL
IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns CallTower’s proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is
commercially sensitive.

3.0 Interpretation, Construction and Severability
3.1 Definitions:
3.1.1 For purposes of this Agreement, certain terms have been defined in this Agreement to encompass
meanings that may differ from, or be in addition to, the normal connotation of the defined word. Unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise, any term defined or used in the singular will include the plural.
Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and
neuter forms. The words “include”, “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
“without limitation” and/or “but not limited to”. The words “will” and “shall” are used interchangeably
throughout this Agreement and the use of either connotes a mandatory requirement. The use of one or the
other will not mean a different degree of right or obligation for either Party. A defined word intended to
convey its special meaning is capitalized when used. Other terms that are capitalized and not defined in
this Agreement will have the meaning in the Act, or in the absence of their inclusion in the Act, their
customary usage in the Telecommunications industry as of the Effective Date.

are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
3.2.2 This Agreement incorporates a number of Attachments which, together with their associated Exhibits,
Schedules and Addenda, constitute the entire Agreement between the Parties. In order to facilitate use and
comprehension of the Agreement, the Attachments have been grouped under broad headings. It is
understood that these groupings are for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to limit the
applicability that any particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addendum may otherwise have.
3.3 Referenced Documents:
3.3.1 Any reference throughout this Agreement to an industry guideline, AT&T-21STATE’s technical guideline or
referenced AT&T-21STATE business rule, guide or other such document containing processes or
specifications applicable to the services provided pursuant to this Agreement, shall be construed to refer to
only those provisions thereof that are applicable to these services, and shall include any successor or
replacement versions thereof, all as they are amended from time to time and all of which are incorporated
herein by reference, and may be found at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.4 References:
3.4.1 References herein to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments, Exhibits, Parts and Schedules shall be deemed to
be references to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments and Parts of, and Exhibits, Schedules to this
Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require.
3.5 Tariff References:
3.5.1 References to state tariffs throughout this Agreement shall be to the currently effective tariff for the state or
jurisdiction in which the services were provisioned; provided however, where certain AT&T-21STATE
services or tariff provisions have been or become deregulated or detariffed, any reference in this Agreement
to a detariffed or deregulated service or provision of such tariff shall be deemed to refer to the service
description, price list or other agreement pursuant to which AT&T-21STATE provides such services as a
result of detariffing or deregulation.
3.5.2 Wherever the term “customer” is used in connection with AT&T-21STATE’s retail tariffs, the term “customer”
means the ultimate consumer or the End User of any tariffed service.
3.5.3 No reference to tariffs in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed as permitting CLEC to purchase
Interconnection Services, under such tariff. Except where expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement,
notwithstanding the availability of Interconnection Services under tariffs in some AT&T-21STATE incumbent
ILEC states, CLEC agrees that any purchase of Interconnection Services addressed by this Agreement or
required to be offered by AT&T-21STATE under Section 251 of the Act, shall be purchased solely pursuant
to the terms, condition and rates set forth in this Agreement. To the extent that complete terms, conditions
and/or rates for any Interconnection Service are not contained in this Agreement at the time CLEC seeks to
order such services, the Parties shall amend this Agreement to include such terms, conditions and rates
prior to CLEC submitting such order. The rates for Interconnection Services inadvertently or improperly
ordered prior to an agreement of the Parties on terms, conditions and/or rates is addressed in the Pricing
Schedule.

those contained in the main body of this Agreement, those definitions, terms or conditions will supersede
those contained in the main body of this Agreement, but only in regard to the services or activities listed in
that particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addendum. In particular, if an Attachment contains a Term
length that differs from the Term length in the main body of this Agreement, the Term length of that

Attachment will control the length of time that services or activities are to occur under that Attachment, but
will not affect the Term length of the remainder of this Agreement.
3.7 Joint Work Product:

agrees that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of
the Parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to affect the intent of the Parties, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with
enforceable language that reflects such intent as closely as possible. The Parties negotiated the terms and
conditions of this Agreement for Interconnection Services as a total arrangement and it is intended to be
non-severable.
3.8 Incorporation by Reference:
3.8.1 All of the rates, terms and conditions (“Provisions”) set forth in this Agreement (including any and all
Attachments, and/or Schedules hereto) and every Interconnection Service provided hereunder, are subject
to all other Provisions contained in this Agreement and all such Provisions are integrally related.
3.9 Non-Voluntary Provisions:
3.9.1 This Agreement incorporates certain rates, terms and conditions that were not voluntarily negotiated and/or
agreed to by AT&T-21STATE, but instead resulted from determinations made in arbitrations under Section
252 of the Act or from other requirements of regulatory agencies or state law (individually and collectively
“Non-Voluntary Arrangement(s)”). If any Non-Voluntary Arrangement is modified as a result of any order or
finding by the FCC, the appropriate Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree to
follow the Intervening Law process outlined in Section 24.0 below.
3.9.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Non-Voluntary Arrangements contained in this Agreement shall not be
available in any state other than the state that originally imposed/required such Non-Voluntary Arrangement.
By way of example only, the Parties acknowledge that the PUC-OH’s imposition in Ohio of the Minimum
Telephone Service Standards (and all terms and conditions relating thereto) shall not apply in or be
“portable to” any State other than Ohio.

case of Section 3.9.2 above, included in the agreement per state requirement) by the Parties only as to the
states where this Agreement has been executed, filed and approved. When the Parties negotiate an
agreement for an additional state, neither Party shall be precluded by any language in this Agreement from
negotiating state-specific terms for the state in which they are to apply.
3.11 Scope of Obligations:
3.11.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, AT&T-21STATE’s obligations under this
Agreement shall apply only to:
3.11.1.1 the specific operating area(s) or portion thereof in which AT&T-21STATE is then deemed to be
the ILEC under the Act (the “ILEC Territory”), and only to the extent that CLEC is operating and

provided by AT&T-21STATE under this Agreement, the Parties agree and acknowledge that their intent is
for the Agreement to comply with Section 3.11.2 above, and require only the provision of Section 251(c)(3)
UNEs.
3.12 Affiliates:
3.12.1 This Agreement, including subsequent amendments, if any, shall bind AT&T-21STATE, CLEC and any
entity that currently or subsequently is owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with
CLEC. CLEC further agrees that the same or substantially the same terms and conditions shall be
incorporated into any separate agreement between AT&T-21STATE and any such CLEC Affiliate that
continues to operate as a separate entity. This Agreement shall remain effective as to CLEC and any such
CLEC Affiliate for the term of this Agreement as stated herein, (subject to any early termination due to
default), until either AT&T-21STATE or CLEC or any such CLEC Affiliate institutes renegotiation consistent

6.1.2.1 the failure of AT&T-21STATE to demand such certificate of insurance or failure of AT&T-
21STATE to identify a deficiency will not be construed as a waiver of CLEC’s obligation to
maintain the insurance required under this Agreement;

CLEC may assign or transfer this Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, to an Affiliate by providing sixty (60) calendar days advance written Notice of such
assignment to AT&T-21STATE; provided that such assignment or transfer is not inconsistent with
Applicable Law (including the Affiliate’s obligation to obtain and maintain proper Commission certification
and approvals) or the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CLEC may
not assign or transfer this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, to an Affiliate if that Affiliate is

this Agreement wherein only the CLEC name is changing, and no CLEC Company Code(s) are changing,

of compliance with industry standards related to any Company Code(s). CLEC is responsible for paying

Service, 251(c)(3) UNEs, function, facility, product or service, CLEC must submit an order for each acquired
asset to reflect the change of ownership in all appropriate AT&T-21STATE systems. All orders must be

7.3.2 In the event of a Company Code Change, CLEC shall comply with Applicable Law relating thereto, including
but not limited to all FCC and state Commission rules relating to notice(s) to End Users.
7.3.3 For any CLEC Company Code Change, CLEC must negotiate a separate transfer or assignment
agreement.
7.3.4 CLEC acknowledges that failing to comply with this Section 7 shall entitle AT&T-21STATE to issue a Notice

7.4 Wherever required by this Section 7, AT&T-21STATE’s consent shall be conditioned upon receipt of
payment for all outstanding charges associated with any transferred or acquired assets.

8.2.1 Unless terminated for breach (including nonpayment), the term of this Agreement shall commence upon the
Effective Date of this Agreement and shall expire on November 1, 2016 (the “Initial Term”).
8.3 Termination for Nonperformance or Breach:
8.3.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, either Party may terminate this Agreement and the
provision of any Interconnection Services provided pursuant to this Agreement, at the sole discretion of the
terminating Party, in the event that the other Party fails to perform a material obligation or breaches a
material term of this Agreement and the other Party fails to cure such nonperformance or breach within
forty-five (45) calendar days after written Notice thereof. If the nonperforming Party fails to cure such
nonperformance or breach within the forty-five (45) calendar day period provided for within the original
Notice, then the terminating Party will provide a subsequent written Notice of the termination of this
Agreement and such termination shall take effect immediately upon delivery of written Notice to the other
Party.
8.3.2 If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE is unable to contact CLEC pursuant to the
Notices provision hereof or any other contact information provided by CLEC under this Agreement, and
there are no active services being provisioned under this Agreement, then AT&T-21STATE may, at its
discretion, terminate this Agreement, without any liability whatsoever, upon sending of notification to CLEC
pursuant to the Notices Section hereof.
8.4 Termination of Agreement after initial term expiration:
8.4.1 Where CLEC has no End Users or is no longer purchasing any services under this Agreement, CLEC may
terminate the Agreement by providing “Notice of Termination” to AT&T-21STATE at any time after the initial
term of this Agreement. After termination the Parties’ liability for termination of this Agreement shall be
limited to obligations under the Survival 41.1 below of this GT&C.
8.4.2 Where CLEC has End Users and/or is purchasing Interconnection Services under this Agreement and either
Party seeks to terminate this Agreement, CLEC shall cooperate in good faith to effect an orderly transition of
service under this Agreement. CLEC shall be solely responsible (from a financial, operational and
administrative standpoint) to ensure that its End Users are transitioned to a new LEC prior to the expiration
or termination date of this Agreement.
8.4.3 If at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days or any time thereafter of the expiration of the Term,
if either Party serves “Notice of Expiration”, CLEC shall have ten (10) calendar days to provide AT&T-
21STATE written confirmation to the Notice of Expiration indicating if CLEC wishes to pursue a successor
agreement with AT&T-21STATE or terminate its Agreement. CLEC shall identify the action to be taken in
each of the applicable state(s). If CLEC wishes to pursue a successor agreement with AT&T-21STATE,
CLEC shall attach to its written confirmation or Notice of Expiration, a written request to commence
negotiations with AT&T-21STATE under Sections 251/252 of the Act and identify each of the state(s) to
which the successor agreement will apply. Upon receipt of CLEC’s Section 252(a)(1) request, the Parties
shall commence good faith negotiations for a successor agreement.
8.4.4 If the Parties are in “Active Negotiations” (negotiations within the statutory clock established in the Act under
Section 252(b)) or have filed for arbitration with the Commission upon expiration date of the Agreement
AT&T-21STATE shall continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement until a successor agreement becomes effective between the Parties. AT&T-
21STATE’s obligation to provide services under this Agreement beyond the expiration date conditions upon
the Parties adherence to the timeframes established within Section 252(b) of the Act. If CLEC does not
adhere to said timeframes or CLEC withdraws its arbitration or seeks an extension of time or continuance of
such arbitration without AT&T-21STATE’s consent, AT&T-21STATE may provide Notice to CLEC that all
services provided thereafter shall be pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s then current standard interconnection agreement (“Generic”) as found on AT&T’s CLEC Online
website.

8.4.5 Either on or following the expiration date of this Agreement, if the Parties have not entered into a new
agreement or are not in Active Negotiations as described in Section 8.4.4 above, then upon written Notice to
CLEC by AT&T-21STATE, AT&T-21STATE may continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s then current Generic found at the AT&T CLEC Online
website. At any time thereafter, the Parties may initiate negotiations for a new agreement by providing a
written Notice under Section 252 to the other Party subject to Section 8.4.6.
8.4.6 AT&T-21STATE may reject a request under Section 252 to initiate negotiations for a new agreement if
CLEC has an outstanding balance under this Agreement. CLEC may send a subsequent notice under

including 1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ported numbers, and ABT.
9.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in
cases of fraud involving 1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties’ fraud minimization
procedures are to be cost-effective and implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm one Party as
compared to the other.
9.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in
Section 9.2 above will include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning End Users
who terminate services to that Party without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such
information is responsible for securing the End User’s permission to obtain such information.
9.4 AT&T-21STATE will use a Fraud Monitoring System to determine suspected occurrences of ABT-related
fraud and will provide notification messages to CLEC on suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud on
CLEC accounts stored in the applicable LIDB.
9.5 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of fraud. CLEC
understands and agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to determine whether a fraud
situation actually exists. CLEC understands and agrees that it will also need to determine what, if any,
action CLEC should take as a result of a Fraud Monitoring System alert.
9.6 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud Monitoring
System alert notification.
10.0 Assurance of Payment
10.1 Upon request by AT&T-21STATE, CLEC will provide AT&T-21STATE with the AT&T-21STATE Credit
Profile form and provide information to AT&T-21STATE regarding CLEC’s credit and financial condition.
10.2 Assurance of payment may be requested by AT&T-21STATE:
10.2.1 If based on AT&T-21STATE’s analysis of the AT&T-21STATE Credit Profile and other relevant information
regarding CLEC’s credit and financial condition, there is an impairment of the credit, financial health, or
credit worthiness of CLEC. Such impairment will be determined from information available from Third Party
financial sources; or
10.2.2 CLEC fails to timely pay a bill rendered to CLEC by AT&T-21STATE (except such portion of a bill that is
subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth
in Section 12.4 below); and/or
10.2.3 CLEC’s gross monthly billing has increased, AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to request additional
security (or to require a security deposit if none was previously requested) and/or file a Uniform Commercial
Code (UCC-1) security interest in CLEC’s “accounts receivables and proceeds”; or

10.2.4 When CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary
case (or has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other
law relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has
made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding.
10.3 If AT&T-21STATE requires CLEC to provide a security deposit, CLEC shall provide such security deposit
prior to the inauguration of service or within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-21STATE’s request, as
applicable. Deposit request notices will be sent to CLEC via certified mail or overnight delivery. Such
notice period will start the day after the deposit request notice is rendered by certified mail or overnight
delivery. Interest on a cash security deposit shall accrue and be applied or refunded in accordance with the
terms in AT&T-21STATE’s applicable Tariff.
10.4 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the assurance of payment will consist of:
10.4.1 a Cash Deposit; or
10.4.2 a Letter of Credit; or
10.4.3 a Surety Bond.
10.5 The Cash Deposit, Letter of Credit or Surety Bond must be in an amount up to three (3) months anticipated
charges (including, but not limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination
charges and advance payments), as reasonably determined by AT&T-21STATE, for the Interconnection
Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation or any other functions, facilities, products or services to be furnished
by AT&T-21STATE under this Agreement. Estimated billings are calculated based upon the monthly
average of the previous six (6) months current billings, if CLEC has received service from AT&T-21STATE
during such period at a level comparable to that anticipated to occur over the next six (6) months. If either
CLEC or AT&T-21STATE has reason to believe that the level of service to be received during the next six
(6) months will be materially higher or lower than received in the previous six (6) months, CLEC and AT&T-
21STATE shall agree on a level of estimated billings based on all relevant information.
10.6 To the extent that AT&T-21STATE elects to require a Cash Deposit, the Parties intend that the provision of
such Cash Deposit shall constitute the grant of a security interest in the Cash Deposit pursuant to Article 9
of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any relevant jurisdiction.
10.7 Interest on a Cash Deposit shall accrue and be applied or refunded in accordance with the terms in the
appropriate AT&T-21STATE Tariff. AT&T-21STATE will not pay interest on a Letter of Credit or a Surety
Bond.
10.8 AT&T-21STATE may, but is not obligated to, draw on the Letter of Credit or the Cash Deposit, as
applicable, upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:
10.8.1 CLEC owes AT&T-21STATE undisputed charges under this Agreement that are more than thirty (30)
calendar days past due; or
10.8.2 CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary case (or
has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other law
relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has made
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding; or
10.8.3 The expiration or termination of this Agreement.
10.9 If AT&T-21STATE draws on the Letter of Credit or Cash Deposit, upon request by AT&T-21STATE, CLEC
will provide a replacement or supplemental Letter of Credit, Surety Bond or Cash Deposit conforming to the
requirements of Section 10.4 above.

10.10 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if AT&T-21STATE makes a request for
assurance of payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.0 then AT&T-21STATE shall have
no obligation thereafter to perform under this Agreement until such time as CLEC has furnished AT&T-
21STATE with the assurance of payment requested; provided, however, that AT&T-21STATE will permit
CLEC a minimum of fifteen (15) calendar days to respond to a request for assurance of payment before
invoking this Section 10.0.
10.11 In the event CLEC fails to provide AT&T-21STATE with a suitable form of security deposit or additional
security deposit as required herein, defaults on its account(s), or otherwise fails to make any payment or
payments required under this Agreement in the manner and within the time required, service to CLEC may
be suspended, discontinued or terminated in accordance with the terms of Section 12.0 below. Upon
termination of services, AT&T-21STATE shall apply any security deposit to CLEC’s final bill for its
account(s). If CLEC fails to furnish the requested adequate assurance of payment on or before the date
set forth in the request, AT&T-21STATE may also invoke the provisions set forth in Section 12.0 below.
10.12 A Cash Deposit held by AT&T-21STATE shall be returned to CLEC if the following conditions have been
met:
10.12.1 Payment was made on bills rendered to CLEC by AT&T-21STATE (except such portion of a bill that is
subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth
in Section 12.4 below) as of the Bill Due Date for all but one time during the prior twelve (12) month period
and all payments were made with checks that were honored; and
10.12.2 There has been no impairment of the established credit and/or financial health from information available
from financial sources, including but not limited to Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and the Wall Street
Journal. Financial information about CLEC that may be considered includes, but is not limited to, investor
warning briefs, rating downgrades, and articles discussing pending credit problems.
10.13 The fact that a Cash Deposit or Letter of Credit is requested by AT&T-21STATE shall in no way relieve
CLEC from timely compliance with all payment obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination charges and advance payments), nor
does it constitute a waiver or modification of the terms of this Agreement pertaining to disconnection or re-
entry for non-payment of any amounts required to be paid hereunder.
10.14 At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit provided by CLEC as security
under this Agreement, CLEC shall renew such Letter of Credit or provide AT&T-21STATE with evidence
that CLEC has obtained a suitable replacement for the Letter of Credit. If CLEC fails to comply with the
foregoing, AT&T-21STATE shall thereafter be authorized to draw down the full amount of such Letter of
Credit and utilize the cash proceeds as security for CLEC accounts(s). If CLEC provides a security deposit
or additional security deposit in the form of a Surety Bond as required herein, CLEC shall renew the Surety
Bond or provide AT&T-21STATE with evidence that CLEC has obtained a suitable replacement for the
Surety Bond at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the cancellation date of the Surety Bond. If CLEC
fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T-21STATE shall thereafter be authorized to take action on the
Surety Bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for CLEC’s account(s). If the credit rating of any
bonding company that has provided CLEC with a Surety Bond provided as security hereunder has fallen
below “B”, AT&T-21STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC that CLEC must provide a replacement
bond or other suitable security within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-21STATE’s written Notice. If
CLEC fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T-21STATE shall thereafter be authorized to take action on
the Surety Bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for CLEC’s account(s). Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, AT&T-21STATE shall be authorized to draw down the full
amount of any Letter of Credit or take action on any Surety Bond provided by CLEC as security hereunder

Agreement in the manner and within the time, as required herein.
11.0 Billing and Payment of Charges
11.1 Unless otherwise stated, each Party will render monthly bill(s), remittance in full by the Bill Due Date, to the
other for Interconnection Services provided hereunder at the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing
Schedule.
11.2 There will be no offset by the billed Party of payments due herein against any other amount owed by one
Party to the other.
11.3 A Late Payment Charge will be assessed for all Past Due payments as provided below, as applicable.
11.3.1 If any portion of the payment is not received by AT&T-21STATE on or before the payment due date as set
forth above, or if any portion of the payment is received by AT&T-21STATE in funds that are not
immediately available to AT&T-21STATE, then a late payment and/or interest charge shall be due to AT&T-
21STATE. The late payment and/or interest charge shall apply to the portion of the payment not received
and shall be assessed as set forth in the applicable state tariff, or, if no applicable state tariff exists, as set
forth in the Guide Book as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website, or pursuant to the applicable state
law as determined by AT&T-21STATE. In addition to any applicable late payment and/or interest charges,
CLEC may be charged a fee for all returned checks at the rate set forth in the applicable state tariff, or, if no
applicable tariff exists, as set forth in the Guide Book or pursuant to the applicable state law.
11.4 If any charge incurred by AT&T-21STATE under this Agreement is Past Due, the unpaid amounts will
accrue interest from the day following the Bill Due Date until paid. The interest rate applied will be the
lesser of (i) the rate used to compute the Late Payment Charge contained in the applicable AT&T-
21STATE intrastate access services tariff for that state and (ii) the highest rate of interest that may be
charged under Applicable Law, compounded daily from the Bill Due Date to and including the date that the
payment is actually made and available.
11.5 The Remittance Information to apply payments must accompany the payment. Payment is considered to
have been made when the payment and Remittance Information are received by AT&T-21STATE. If the
Remittance Information is not received with payment, AT&T-21STATE will be unable to apply amounts
paid to CLEC’s accounts. In such event, AT&T-21STATE shall hold such funds until the Remittance
Information is received. If AT&T-21STATE does not receive the Remittance Information by the Bill due
date for any account(s), Late Payment Charges shall apply.
11.6 CLEC shall make all payments to AT&T-21STATE via electronic funds transfers (EFTs) through the
Automated Clearing House Association (ACH) to the financial institution designated by AT&T-21STATE.
Remittance Information will be communicated together with the funds transfer via the ACH network. CLEC
must use the CCD+ or the CTX Standard Entry Class code. CLEC and AT&T-21STATE will abide by the
National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) Rules and Regulations. Each ACH payment
must be received by AT&T-21STATE no later than the Bill Due Date of each bill or Late Payment Charges
will apply. AT&T-21STATE is not liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in entries caused by
CLEC or Third Parties, including CLEC’s financial institution. CLEC is responsible for its own banking fees.
11.7 Prior to establishing EFT, CLEC will complete a Customer Information Form for Electronic Payments
(ECF11 Form) found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website. This form provides AT&T-21STATE with CLEC’s
set up and contract information for electronic payments. AT&T-21STATE banking information will be
provided by AT&T-21STATE Treasury & Remittance Operations on AT&T-21STATE approved forms after
CLEC’s completed ECF11 form is received, testing has completed and certification confirmed.

11.8 Processing of payments not made via electronic funds credit transfers through the ACH network may be
delayed. CLEC is responsible for any Late Payment Charges resulting from CLEC’s failure to use
electronic funds credit transfers through the ACH network.
11.9 If Unpaid Charges are subject to a billing dispute between the Parties, the Non-Paying Party must, prior to
the Bill Due Date, give written notice to the Billing Party of the Disputed Amounts and include in such
written notice the specific details and reasons for disputing each item listed in Section 13.4 below. The

disputes to the Billing Party. On or before the Bill Due Date, the Non-Paying Party must pay: (i) all
undisputed amounts to the Billing Party and (ii) all Disputed Amounts, except for Disputed Amounts arising
from compensation for the termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic or ISP-Bound Traffic, into an interest
bearing escrow account with a Third Party escrow agent that is mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

proportion as the principal; and
11.10.2.5 disbursements from the escrow account will be limited to those:

not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The times specified in this Section 13.0 may be extended or shortened upon mutual agreement
of the Parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. Each Party will bear its own costs of these
procedures, including attorneys’ fees. The Parties will equally split the fees of the arbitration and the
arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction.

than five percent (5%) of the aggregate charges for the audited services during the period covered by the
audit.
14.9 Any disputes concerning audit results shall be referred to the Parties’ respective personnel responsible for
informal resolution. If these individuals cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the

maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Party shall not be liable to such End User or Third
Party for (i) any Loss relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that
exceeds the amount such Party would have charged the End User or Third Party for the Interconnection
Services that gave rise to such Loss and (ii) any Consequential Damages. If a Party elects not to place in

constitutes a violation of the Act or other statute), and regardless of whether the Parties knew or had been
advised of the possibility that such damages could result in connection with or arising from anything said,
omitted, or done hereunder or related hereto, including willful acts or omissions; provided that the foregoing
shall not limit a Party’s obligation under Section 16.0 to indemnify, defend, and hold the other Party

harmless against any amounts payable to a Third Party, including any Losses, and Consequential
Damages of such Third Party; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 16.4 shall impose indemnity
obligations on a Party for any Loss or Consequential Damages suffered by that Party’s End User in
connection with any affected Interconnection Services. Except as provided in the prior sentence, each
Party (“Indemnifying Party”) hereby releases and holds harmless the other Party (“Indemnitee”) (and
Indemnitee’s Affiliates, and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents) against any Loss or
Claim made by the Indemnifying Party’s End User.
16.5 AT&T-21STATE shall not be liable for damages to an End User’s premises resulting from the furnishing of
any Interconnection Services, including, if applicable, the installation and removal of equipment and
associated wiring, and Collocation Equipment unless the damage is caused by AT&T-21STATE’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct. AT&T-21STATE does not guarantee or make any warranty with respect
to Interconnection Services when used in an explosive atmosphere.
16.6 CLEC hereby releases AT&T-21STATE from any and all liability for damages due to errors or omissions in
CLEC’s End User listing information as provided by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE under this Agreement,
including any errors or omissions occurring in the Directory Database or the White Pages directory, or any
claims by reason of delay in providing the Directory Assistance listing information, printing or provisioning of
non-published numbers or the printing or providing of CLEC End User information in the White Pages
directory including, but not limited to, special, indirect, Consequential, punitive or incidental damages.
16.7 AT&T-21STATE shall not be liable to CLEC, its End User or any other Person for any Loss alleged to arise
out of the provision of access to 911 service or any errors, interruptions, defects, failures or malfunctions of
911 service.
16.8 This Section 16.0 is not intended to exempt any Party from all liability under this Agreement, but only to set
forth the scope of liability agreed to and the type of damages that are recoverable. Both Parties
acknowledge that they negotiated regarding alternate limitation of liability provisions but that such
provisions would have altered the cost, and thus the price, of providing the Interconnection, Resale
Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs, functions, facilities, products and services available hereunder, and no different
pricing reflecting different costs and different limits of liability was agreed to.
17.0 Joint and Several Liability
17.1 In the event that CLEC consists of two (2) or more separate entities as set forth in this Agreement and/or
any Amendments hereto, or any third party places orders under this Agreement using CLEC’s company
codes or identifiers, all such entities shall be jointly and severally liable for CLEC’s obligations under this
Agreement.
18.0 Indemnity
18.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific Attachments, each Party shall be responsible
only for the Interconnection Services which are provided by that Party, its authorized agents,
subcontractors, or others retained by such Parties, and neither Party shall bear any responsibility for the
Interconnection Services, provided by the other Party, its agents, subcontractors, or others retained by
such Parties.
18.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific Attachments, and to the extent not prohibited
by Applicable Law and not otherwise controlled by tariff, each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall release,
defend and indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”) and hold such Indemnified Party harmless
against any Loss to a Third Party arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct (“Fault”) of such
Indemnifying Party, its agents, its End Users, contractors, or others retained by such Parties, in connection
with the Indemnifying Party’s provision of Interconnection Services under this Agreement; provided,

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
however, that (i) with respect to employees or agents of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while
performing within the scope of their employment, (ii) with respect to subcontractors of the Indemnifying
Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing duties of the subcontractor under its subcontract with
the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) with respect to the Fault of employees or agents of such subcontractor,
such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their employment by the subcontractor with respect
to such duties of the subcontractor under the subcontract.
18.3 In the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a End User of either Party, the Party whose End User alleged
or claimed such Loss (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend and indemnify the other Party (the
“Indemnified Party”) against any and all such Claims or Losses by its End User regardless of whether the
underlying Interconnection Service giving rise to such Claim or Loss was provided or provisioned by the
Indemnified Party, unless the Claim or Loss was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnified Party.
18.4 A Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (“Indemnified
Party”) against any Claim or Loss arising from the Indemnifying Party’s use of Interconnection Services
provided under this Agreement involving:
18.4.1 Any Claim or Loss arising from such Indemnifying Party’s use of Interconnection Services offered under this
Agreement, involving any Claim for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, or infringement of Intellectual Property
rights arising from the Indemnifying Party’s or its End User’s use.
18.4.1.1 The foregoing includes any Claims or Losses arising from disclosure of any End User-specific
information associated with either the originating or terminating numbers used to provision
Interconnection Services provided hereunder and all other Claims arising out of any act or
omission of the End User in the course of using any Interconnection Services provided pursuant
to this Agreement.
18.4.1.2 The foregoing includes any Losses arising from Claims for actual or alleged infringement of any
Intellectual Property right of a Third Party to the extent that such Loss arises from an
Indemnifying Party’s or an Indemnifying Party’s End User’s use of Interconnection Services,
provided under this Agreement; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party’s obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party shall not apply:
18.4.1.2.1 where an Indemnified Party or its End User modifies Interconnection Services,
provided under this Agreement; and
18.4.1.2.2 no infringement would have occurred without such modification.
18.4.2 Any and all penalties imposed on either Party because of the Indemnifying Party’s failure to comply with the
Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA); provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall also, at its sole cost and expense, pay any amounts necessary to modify or replace any equipment,
facilities or services provided to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement to ensure that such equipment,
facilities and services fully comply with CALEA.
18.5 CLEC acknowledges that its right under this Agreement to Interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s network
and to unbundle and/or combine AT&T-21STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s
Network Elements) may be subject to or limited by Intellectual Property rights (including without limitation,
patent, copyright, trade secret, trade mark, service mark, trade name and trade dress rights) and contract
rights of Third Parties.
18.6 AT&T-21STATE agrees to use its best efforts to obtain for CLEC, under commercially reasonable terms,
Intellectual Property rights to each 251(c)(3) UNE necessary for CLEC to use such 251(c)(3) UNE in the
same manner as AT&T-21STATE.

18.7 AT&T-21STATE shall have no obligation to attempt to obtain for CLEC any Intellectual Property right(s)
that would permit CLEC to use any 251(c)(3) UNE in a different manner than used by AT&T-21STATE.
18.8 To the extent not prohibited by a contract with the vendor of the network element sought by CLEC that
contains Intellectual Property licenses, AT&T-21STATE shall reveal to CLEC the name of the vendor, the
Intellectual Property rights licensed to AT&T-21STATE under the vendor contract and the terms of the
contract (excluding cost terms). AT&T-21STATE shall, at CLEC’s request, contact the vendor to attempt to
obtain permission to reveal additional contract details to CLEC.
18.9 All costs associated with the extension of Intellectual Property rights to CLEC pursuant to Section 20.1
below, including the cost of the license extension itself and the costs associated with the effort to obtain the
license, shall be a part of the cost of providing the 251(c)(3) UNE to which the Intellectual Property rights
relate and apportioned to all requesting carriers using that 251(c)(3) UNE including AT&T-21STATE.
18.10 AT&T-21STATE hereby conveys no licenses to use such Intellectual Property rights and makes no
warranties, express or implied, concerning CLEC’s (or any Third Parties’) rights with respect to such
Intellectual Property rights and contract rights, including whether such rights will be violated by such
Interconnection or unbundling and/or combining of 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s
Network Elements) in AT&T-21STATE’s network or CLEC’s use of other functions, facilities, products or
services furnished under this Agreement. Any licenses or warranties for Intellectual Property rights
associated with 251(c)(3) UNEs subject to the ownership terms stated in Section 20 of this Agreement.
18.11 AT&T-21STATE does not and shall not indemnify, defend or hold CLEC harmless, nor be responsible for
indemnifying or defending, or holding CLEC harmless, for any Claims or Losses for actual or alleged
infringement of any Intellectual Property right or interference with or violation of any contract right that
arises out of, is caused by, or relates to CLEC’s Interconnection with AT&T-21STATE’s network and
unbundling and/or combining AT&T-21STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s Network
Elements) or CLEC’s use of other functions, facilities, products or services furnished under this Agreement.
Any indemnities for Intellectual Property rights associated with 251(c)(3) UNEs shall be vendor’s
indemnities and are subject to the ownership terms stated in Section 20 of this Agreement.
18.12 CLEC shall reimburse AT&T-21STATE for damages to AT&T-21STATE’s facilities utilized to provide
Interconnection Services hereunder caused by the negligence or willful act of CLEC, its agents or
subcontractors or CLEC’s End User or resulting from CLEC’s improper use of AT&T-21STATE’s facilities,
or due to malfunction of any facilities, functions, products, services or equipment provided by any person or
entity other than AT&T-21STATE. Upon reimbursement for damages, AT&T-21STATE will cooperate with
CLEC in prosecuting a claim against the person causing such damage. CLEC shall be subrogated to the
right of recovery by AT&T-21STATE for the damages to the extent of such payment.
18.13 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each Party agrees that should it cause any non-
standard digital subscriber line (“xDSL”) technologies (as that term is defined in the applicable Attachment
14 - xDSL Loops and/or the applicable Commission-ordered tariff, as appropriate) to be deployed or used
in connection with or on AT&T-21STATE facilities, that Party (“Indemnifying Party”) will pay all costs
associated with any damage, service interruption or other Telecommunications Service degradation, or
damage to the other Party’s (“Indemnitee’s”) facilities.
18.14 Indemnification Procedures:
18.14.1 Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this Section 18.0, the relevant Indemnified Party, as
appropriate, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and request in writing the Indemnifying Party to
defend the same. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that the Indemnifying Party might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices the
Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such claim.

18.14.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of the defense of such
claim and the identity of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party.
18.14.3 Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides written notice of acceptance of the defense of such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall defend such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to any right of
the Indemnifying Party to seek reimbursement for the costs of such defense in the event that it is
determined that Indemnifying Party had no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such claim.
18.14.4 Upon accepting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control and conduct the
defense and settlement of any such claims, subject to consultation with the Indemnified Party. So long as
the Indemnifying Party is controlling and conducting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in
advance and agrees to be bound by the agreement incorporating such settlement.
18.14.5 At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise or settlement, and, at such
refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that, in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the refusing Party against, any cost or liability in
excess of such refused compromise or settlement.
18.14.6 With respect to any defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to
participate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the claim requests equitable relief or other relief
that could affect the rights of the Indemnified Party, and shall also be entitled to employ separate counsel for
such defense at such Indemnified Party’s expense.
18.14.7 If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any indemnified claim as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel for such defense at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party.
18.14.8 In the event of a failure to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may negotiate a settlement, which
shall be presented to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented
settlement, the Indemnifying Party may take over the defense. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to
the presented settlement and refuses to take over the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any
reasonable cash settlement not involving any admission of liability by the Indemnifying Party, though such
settlement may have been made by the Indemnified Party without approval of the Indemnifying Party, it
being the Parties’ intent that no settlement involving a non-monetary concession by the Indemnifying Party,
including an admission of liability by such Party, shall take effect without the written approval of the
Indemnifying Party.
18.14.9 Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause its employees and agents to cooperate with the other Party in
the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each Party shall be available to the other Party
with respect to any such defense, subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Section 23.0 below.
19.0 Performance Measures
19.1 Attachment 09 - Performance Measures specifies applicable performance standards. To the extent that
remedies are available under such Attachment, such remedies constitute the sole obligation of AT&T-
21STATE to pay damages or financial penalties for failure to meet specified performance standards
identified in such Attachment and all other Attachments to this Agreement.
20.0 Intellectual Property/License
20.1 Any Intellectual Property originating from or developed by a Party shall remain in the exclusive ownership
of that Party.
20.2 Except at otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no license under patents, copyrights or any
other Intellectual Property right (other than the limited license to use consistent with the terms, conditions

24.0 Intervening Law
24.1 This Agreement is the result of negotiations between the Parties and may incorporate certain provisions
that resulted from arbitration by the appropriate state Commission(s). In entering into this Agreement and
any Amendments to such Agreement and carrying out the provisions herein, neither Party waives, but
instead expressly reserves, all of its rights, remedies and arguments with respect to any orders, decisions,
legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof and any other federal or state regulatory, legislative or
judicial action(s) which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated into this Agreement (e.g. In the Matter of
Connect America Fund, a National Broadband Plan for Our Future, Establishing Just and Reasonable
Rates for Local Exchange Carriers, High-cost Universal Service Support, Developing a Unified Intercarrier
Compensation Regime, Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Lifeline and Link-Up, Universal
Service Reform – Mobility Fund, WC Docket No. 10-90, GN Docket No. 09-51, WC Docket No. 07-135, WC
Docket No. 05-337, CC Docket No. 01-92, CC Docket No. 96-45, WC Docket No. 03-109, WT No 10-208, Report and
Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 11-161 (rel. Nov. 18, 2011 and subsequent authority) or
which may be the subject of further review. If any action by any state or federal regulatory or legislative
body or court of competent jurisdiction invalidates, modifies, or stays the enforcement of laws or regulations
that were the basis or rationale for any rate(s), term(s) and/or condition(s) (“Provisions”) of the Agreement
and/or otherwise affects the rights or obligations of either Party that are addressed by this Agreement, the
Affected Provision(s) shall be immediately invalidated, modified or stayed consistent with the action of the
regulatory or legislative body or court of competent jurisdiction upon the written request of either Party in
accordance with Section 21.0 above (“Written Notice”). With respect to any Written Notices hereunder, the
Parties shall have sixty (60) days from the Written Notice to attempt to reach agreement on appropriate
conforming modifications to the Agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the conforming
modifications within sixty (60) days from the Written Notice, any disputes between the Parties concerning
such actions shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process provided for in this Agreement.
25.0 Regulatory Approval
25.1 The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement and any amendment or modification hereto will be
filed with the Commission for approval in accordance with Section 252 of the Act and may thereafter be
filed with the FCC. The Parties believe in good faith and agree that the services to be provided under this
Agreement are in the public interest. Each Party covenants and agrees to fully support approval of this
Agreement by the Commission or the FCC under Section 252 of the Act without modification.
26.0 Governing Law
26.1 Unless otherwise provided by Applicable Law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Act, the FCC Rules and Regulations interpreting the Act and other applicable federal
law. To the extent that federal law would apply state law in interpreting this Agreement, the domestic laws
of the state in which the Interconnection Services at issue are furnished or sought shall apply, without
regard to that state’s conflict of laws principles.
27.0 Venue
27.1 Except as specified below, the Parties agree that the only proper venue for any judicial or regulatory
proceeding involving or arising out of the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement as it pertains to
any state shall be the city in which the state commission that approved the Agreement for that state is
located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that the only proper venue in the following states
is as follows: Illinois, Chicago; Michigan, Detroit; and Missouri, St. Louis.
28.0 Changes in End User Local Exchange Service Provider Selection
28.1 Each Party will abide by applicable federal and state laws and regulations in obtaining End User
authorization prior to changing an End User’s Local Exchange Carrier to itself and in assuming

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE

responsibility for any applicable charges as specified in the FCC’s rules regarding Subscriber Carrier
Selection Changes (47 CFR 64.1100 through 64.1170), and any applicable state regulation. Each Party
shall retain on file all applicable letters and other documentation of authorization relating to its End User’s
selection of such Party as its LEC, which documentation shall be available for inspection by the other Party
at its request during normal business hours and at no charge.
28.2 Only an End User can initiate a challenge to a change in its LEC. If an End User notifies one Party that the
End User requests local Exchange Service, and the other Party is such End User’s LEC, then the Party
receiving such request shall be free to immediately access such End User’s CPNI subject to the
requirements of Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS) restricting access to CPNI in order to
immediately provide service to such End User.
28.3 When an End User changes or withdraws authorization from its LEC, each Party shall release End User-
specific facilities belonging to the ILEC in accordance with the End User’s direction or that of the End
User’s authorized agent. Further, when an End User abandons its premise (that is, its place of business or
domicile), AT&T-21STATE is free to reclaim the 251(c)(3) UNE facilities for use by another End User and is
free to issue service orders required to reclaim such facilities.
28.4 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another Local
Exchange Carrier, including AT&T-21STATE, AT&T-21STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities
provided to CLEC, regardless of whether those facilities are provided as network elements or as part of a
resold service, and regardless of whether the End User served with such facilities has paid all charges to
CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or otherwise. AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC that
such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has been completed.
28.5 Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to investigate any allegations of unauthorized changes
in local Exchange Service (slamming) at the request of the other Party; provided, however, that each Party
shall cooperate with any investigation of a complaint alleging an unauthorized change in local Exchange
Service at the request of the FCC or the applicable state Commission.
29.0 Compliance and Certification
29.1 Each Party shall comply at its own expense with all Applicable Laws that relate to that Party’s obligations to
the other Party under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring or
permitting either Party to contravene any mandatory requirement of Applicable Law.
29.2 Each Party warrants that it has obtained all necessary state certification required in each state covered by
this Agreement prior to ordering any Interconnection Services from the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon request, each Party shall provide proof of certification.
29.3 Each Party shall be responsible for obtaining and keeping in effect all approvals from, and rights granted
by, Governmental Authorities, building and property owners, other carriers, and any other Third Parties that
may be required in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
29.4 Each Party represents and warrants that any equipment, facilities or services provided to the other Party
under this Agreement comply with the CALEA.
29.5 CLEC shall provide AT&T-21STATE with CLEC’s complete and valid OCNs/AECNs as assigned by NECA
and ACNA as assigned by iconectiv (“Profile Codes”), for each state to which this Agreement applies. For
renegotiated agreements, CLEC shall also provide a list of all OCNs/AECNs and ACNAs associated with
products and services purchased prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement. CLEC shall provide the
Profile Codes via the appropriate OSS, (e.g., CLEC Profile) within thirty (30) calendar days of this
Agreement being approved by the applicable Commission. CLEC shall not order products or services
under this Agreement until it has provided its Profile Codes as set forth in this Section.

30.0 Law Enforcement
30.1 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in handling law enforcement
requests as follows:
30.1.1 Intercept Devices:
30.1.1.1 Local and federal law enforcement agencies periodically request information or assistance
(“Requesting Authority”) from a Telecommunications Carrier. When either Party receives a
request (“Receiving Party”) associated with an End User of the other Party and the Receiving
Party does not provide the network end-office/loop switching functionality to such End User, the
Receiving Party will promptly notify the Requesting Authority so that the Requesting Authority
may redirect its request to the appropriate Party that provides such functionality.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party shall comply with any valid request of a
Requesting Authority to attach a pen register, trap-and-trace or form of intercept on the
Receiving Party’s Facilities.
30.1.2 Subpoenas:
30.1.2.1 If a Receiving Party receives a subpoena (or equivalent legal demand regardless of
nomenclature, e.g., warrant) for information concerning an End User the Receiving Party knows
to be an End User of the other Party and for whom the Receiving Party has no responsive
information, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the person or entity that caused issuance
of such subpoena so that it may redirect its subpoena to the other Party.
30.1.3 Emergencies:
30.1.3.1 If a Receiving Party receives a request from a law enforcement agency for a temporary number
change, temporary disconnect, or one-way denial of outbound calls by the Receiving Party’s
switch regarding an End User of the other Party, the Receiving Party will comply with a valid
emergency request. However, neither Party shall be held liable for any claims or Losses alleged
by the other Party’s End Users arising from compliance with such requests on behalf of the other
Party’s End User and the Party serving such End User agrees to indemnify and hold the other
Party harmless against any and all such claims or Losses.
30.2 Each of the Parties agree to comply with the applicable state and federal law enforcement authorities, laws,
and requirements, including but not limited to, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA) and to report to applicable State and Federal law enforcement authorities as required by law.
31.0 Relationship of the Parties/Independent Contractor
31.1 Each Party is an independent contractor, and has and hereby retains the right to exercise full control of and
supervision over its own performance of its obligations under this Agreement and retains full control over
the employment, direction, compensation and discharge of its employees assisting in the performance of
such obligations. Each Party and each Party’s contractor(s) shall be solely responsible for all matters
relating to payment of such employees, including the withholding or payment of all applicable federal, state
and local income taxes, social security taxes and other payroll taxes with respect to its employees, as well
as any taxes, contributions or other obligations imposed by applicable state unemployment or workers’
compensation acts and all other regulations governing such matters. Each Party has sole authority and
responsibility to hire, fire and otherwise control its employees.
31.2 Nothing contained herein shall constitute the Parties as joint venturers, partners, employees or agents of
one another, and neither Party shall have the right or power to bind or obligate the other. Nothing herein
will be construed as making either Party responsible or liable for the obligations and undertakings of the
other Party. Except for provisions herein expressly authorizing a Party to act for another, nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute a Party as a legal representative or agent of the other Party, nor shall a Party
have the right or authority to assume, create or incur any liability or any obligation of any kind, express or

implied, against or in the name or on behalf of the other Party unless otherwise expressly permitted by such
other Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Party undertakes to perform
any obligation of the other Party, whether regulatory or contractual, or to assume any responsibility for the
management of the other Party’s business.
32.0 No Third Party Beneficiaries; Disclaimer of Agency
32.1 This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall create or be construed to create any Third Party beneficiary rights hereunder.

reimbursement, cause of action, or other right in excess of those existing without reference hereto.
33.0 Subcontracting
33.1 If either Party retains or engages any subcontractor to perform any of that Party’s obligations under this
Agreement, each Party will remain fully responsible for the performance of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, including any obligations either Party performs through subcontractors.
33.2 Each Party will be solely responsible for payments due that Party’s subcontractors.
33.3 No subcontractor will be deemed a Third Party beneficiary for any purposes under this Agreement.
33.4 No contract, subcontract or other agreement entered into by either Party with any Third Party in connection
with the provision of Interconnection Services hereunder will provide for any indemnity, guarantee or
assumption of liability by the other Party to this Agreement with respect to such arrangement, except as
consented to in writing by the other Party.
33.5 Any subcontractor that gains access to Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) or Proprietary
Information covered by this Agreement shall be required by the subcontracting Party to protect such CPNI
or Proprietary Information to the same extent the subcontracting Party is required to protect such CPNI or
Proprietary Information under the terms of this Agreement.
34.0 Responsibility for Environmental Contamination
34.1 Each Party shall be solely responsible at its own expense for the proper handling, use, removal,
excavation, storage, treatment, transport, disposal, or any other management by such Party or any person
acting on its behalf of all Hazardous Substances and Environmental Hazards introduced to the affected
work location and will perform such activities in accordance with Applicable Law. “Hazardous Substances”
means (i) any material or substance that is defined or classified as a hazardous substance, hazardous

AT&T-21STATE is responsible under Applicable Law or a Hazardous Substance introduced into the work
location by AT&T-21STATE or any person acting on behalf of AT&T-21STATE.
34.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, CLEC shall, at AT&T-21STATE’s request, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless AT&T-21STATE,
each of its officers, directors and employees from and against any losses, damages, costs, fines, penalties
and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s and consultant’s fees) of every kind and nature to the extent
they are incurred by any of those parties in connection with a claim, demand, suit, or proceeding for
damages, penalties, contribution, injunction, or any other kind of relief that is based upon, arises out of, is
caused by, or results from: (i) the removal or disposal of a Hazardous Substance from the work location by
CLEC or any person acting on behalf of CLEC, or the subsequent storage, processing, or other handling of
such Hazardous Substances after they have been removed from the work location, (ii) the Release of a
Hazardous Substance, regardless of its source, by CLEC or any person acting on behalf of CLEC, or (iii)
the presence at the work location of an Environmental Hazard for which CLEC is responsible under
Applicable Law or a Hazardous Substance introduced into the work location by CLEC or any person acting
on behalf of CLEC.
35.0 Force Majeure
35.1 No Party shall be responsible for delays or failures in performance of any part of this Agreement (other than
an obligation to make monetary payments) resulting from a “Force Majeure Event” or any Delaying Event
caused by the other Party or any other circumstances beyond the Party’s reasonable control. A “Force
Majeure Event” is defined as acts or occurrences beyond the reasonable control of a Party or the Parties,
including acts of nature, acts of civil or military authority, any law, order, regulation, ordinance of any
Governmental Authority, embargoes, epidemics, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions,
earthquakes, nuclear accidents, hurricanes, floods, labor difficulties, including without limitation, strikes,
slowdowns, picketing, boycotts or other work stoppages, equipment failures, cable cuts, power blackouts,
volcanic action, other major environmental disturbances, unusually severe weather conditions, inability to
secure products or services of other persons or transportation facilities or acts or omissions of
transportation carriers, individually and collectively a Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event shall
occur, the Party affected shall give notice to the other Party of such Force Majeure Event within a
reasonable period of time following such an event specifying the nature, date of inception and expected
duration of such Force Majeure Event, whereupon such obligation or performance shall be suspended to
the extent such Party is affected by such Force Majeure Event during the continuance thereof or be
excused from such performance depending on the nature, severity and duration of such Force Majeure
Event (and the other Party shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations to the extent such
Party’s obligations relate to the performance so interfered with). The affected Party shall use its reasonable
efforts to avoid or remove the cause of nonperformance and the Parties shall give like Notice and proceed
to perform with dispatch once the causes are removed or cease.
36.0 Taxes
36.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 36.0, with respect to any purchase of products or services
under this Agreement, if any Tax is required or permitted by Applicable Law to be billed to and/or collected
from the purchasing Party by the providing Party, then: (i) the providing Party shall have the right to bill the

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE
Page 49 of 59
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
purchasing Party for such Tax; (ii) the purchasing Party shall pay such Tax to the providing Party; and (iii)
the providing Party shall pay or remit such Tax to the respective Governmental Authority. Whenever
possible, Taxes shall be billed as a separate item on the invoice; provided, however, that failure to include
Taxes on an invoice or to state a Tax separately shall not impair the obligation of the purchasing Party to
pay any Tax. Nothing shall prevent the providing Party from paying any Tax to the appropriate
Governmental Authority prior to the time: (i) it bills the purchasing Party for such Tax, or (ii) it collects the
Tax from the purchasing Party. If the providing Party fails to bill the purchasing Party for a Tax at the time
of billing the products or services to which the Tax relates, then, as between the providing Party and the
purchasing Party, the providing Party shall be liable for any penalties or interest thereon. However, if the
purchasing Party fails to pay any Tax properly billed by the providing Party, then, as between the providing
Party and the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall be solely responsible for payment of the Tax
and any penalties or interest thereon. Subject to the provisions of this Section 36.0 governing contests of
disputed Taxes, the purchasing Party shall be liable for and the providing Party may collect from the
purchasing Party any Tax, including any interest or penalties for which the purchasing Party would be liable
under this subsection, which is paid by Providing Party to the respective Governmental Authority within the
applicable statue of limitations periods for assessment or collection of such Tax, including extensions;
provided, however, that the providing Party notifies the purchasing Party within the earlier of (i) sixty (60)
days following the running of such limitations period for including extensions, or (ii) six (6) years following
the purchasing Party’s payment for the products or services to which such Tax relates.
36.2 With respect to any purchase under this Agreement of products or services that are resold by the
purchasing Party to a Third Party or used as a component part of or integrated into a product or service
sold to a Third Party, if any Tax is imposed on or with respect to such sale by the purchasing Party, the
purchasing Party shall pay or remit such Tax to the respective Governmental Authority. If the purchasing
Party fails to pay or remit any Tax as required by Applicable Law, then, as between the providing Party and
the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall remain liable for such Tax and any interest and penalties
thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the purchasing Party agrees to protect,
indemnify and hold harmless (and defend at the purchasing Party’s expense) the providing Party from and
against any Tax, any interest or penalties thereon, and any costs or expenses (including attorney fees)
incurred by the providing Party as a result of any claim asserted or actions taken by the respective
Governmental Authority to assess against or collect from the providing Party any Tax related to any sale by
the purchasing Party to a third Party.
36.3 To the extent a purchase of products or services under this Agreement is claimed by the purchasing Party
to be for resale or otherwise exempt from a Tax, the purchasing Party shall furnish to the providing Party an
exemption certificate in the form prescribed by the providing Party and any other information or
documentation required by Applicable Law or the respective Governmental Authority. Prior to receiving
such exemption certificate and any such other required information or documentation, the Providing Party
shall have the right to bill, and the Purchasing Party shall pay, Tax on any products or services furnished
hereunder as if no exemption were available, subject to the right of the Purchasing Party to pursue a claim
for credit or refund of any such Tax pursuant to the provisions of this Section 36.0 and the remedies
available under Applicable Law. If it is the position of the purchasing Party that Applicable Law exempts or
excludes a purchase of products or services under this Agreement from a Tax, or that the Tax otherwise
does not apply to such a purchase, but Applicable Law does not also provide a specific procedure for
claiming such exemption or exclusion or for the purchaser to contest the application of the Tax directly with
the respective Governmental Authority prior to payment, then the providing Party may in its discretion agree
not to bill and/or not to require payment of such Tax by the purchasing Party, provided that the purchasing
Party (i) furnishes the providing Party with any exemption certificate requested by and in the form
prescribed by the providing Party, (ii) furnishes the providing Party with a letter signed by an officer of the
purchasing Party setting forth the basis of the purchasing Party’s position under Applicable Law; and (iii)

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
furnishes the providing Party with an indemnification agreement, reasonably acceptable to the providing
Party, which holds the providing Party harmless from any Tax, interest, penalties, loss, cost or expenses
(including attorney fees) that may be incurred by the providing Party in connection with any claim asserted
or actions taken by the respective Governmental Authority to assess or collect such Tax from the providing
Party.
36.4 To the extent permitted by and pursuant to Applicable Law, and subject to the provisions of this Section
36.0, the purchasing Party shall have the right to contest with the respective Governmental Authority, or if
necessary under Applicable Law to have the providing Party contest (in either case at the purchasing
Party’s expense) any Tax that the purchasing Party asserts is not applicable, from which it claims an
exemption or exclusion, or which it claims to have paid in error; provided, however, that (i) the purchasing
Party shall ensure that no lien is attached to any asset of the providing Party as a result of any contest of a
disputed Tax; (ii) with respect to any Tax that could be assessed against or collected from the providing
Party by the respective Governmental Authority, the providing Party shall retain the right to determine the
manner of contesting such disputed Tax, including but not limited to a decision that the disputed Tax will be
contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund; (iii) except to the extent that the providing Party has
agreed pursuant to this Section 36.0 not to bill and/or not to require payment of such Tax by the purchasing
Party pending the outcome of such contest, the purchasing Party pays any such Tax previously billed by
the providing Party and continues paying such Tax as billed by the providing Party pending the outcome of
such contest. In the event that a disputed Tax is to be contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund, if
requested in writing by the purchasing Party, the providing Party shall facilitate such contest (i) by assigning
to the purchasing Party its right to claim a credit or refund, if such an assignment is permitted under
Applicable Law; or (ii) if an assignment is not permitted, by filing and pursuing the claim on behalf of the
purchasing Party but at the purchasing Party’s expense. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 36.0, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair, limit, restrict or otherwise affect the
right of the providing Party to contest a Tax that could be assessed against or collected from it by the
respective Governmental Authority. With respect to any contest of a disputed Tax resulting in a refund,
credit or other recovery, as between the purchasing Party and the providing Party, the purchasing Party
shall be entitled to the amount that it previously paid, plus any applicable interest allowed on the recovery
that is attributable to such amount, and the providing Party shall be entitled to all other amounts.
36.5 If either Party is audited by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority with respect to a Tax, and in any
contest of a Tax by either Party, the other Party shall cooperate fully and timely by providing records,
testimony and such additional information or assistance as may reasonably be necessary to expeditiously
resolve the audit or pursue the contest.
36.6 All Notices, affidavits, exemption certificates or other communications required or permitted to be given by
either Party to the other under this Section 36.0 shall be sent in accordance with Section 21.0 above
hereof.
36.7 AT&T TEXAS only: CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is required to comply with Chapter 283 of the
Texas Local Government Code, as it may be amended from time to time, and the reporting and
compensation requirements of Subchapter R of the P.U.C. Substantive Rules – Chapter 26, Applicable to
Telecommunications Service Providers, as they may be amended from time to time. With respect to
municipal fees charged pursuant to Chapter 283, Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code, CLEC agrees that it will directly
report its access lines to the Public Utility Commission of Texas, will remit the related payments to
municipalities, and will otherwise comply with Chapter 283 and applicable P.U.C rules, as they may be
amended from time to time. CLEC agrees that its failure to comply with all Chapter 283 requirements,
including any failure to provide AT&T-21STATE with a valid Adequate Proof Agreement acknowledging
CLEC’s obligation to pay municipal fees within thirty (30) days of AT&T-21STATE’s request, shall be
considered a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle AT&T-21STATE to any and all remedies

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE
Page 51 of 59
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
provided elsewhere in this Agreement for such a breach, including, but not limited to suspension of all order
processing (other than disconnect orders).
37.0 Non Waiver
37.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
consent to any default under this Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and properly
executed by or on behalf of the Party against whom such waiver or consent is claimed. Waiver by either
Party of any default by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default. Failure of either
Party to insist on performance of any term or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or future waiver of such term, condition, right or
privilege. No course of dealing or failure of any Party to strictly enforce any term, right, or condition of this
Agreement in any instance shall be construed as a general waiver or relinquishment of such term, right or
condition.
38.0 Network Maintenance and Management
38.1 The Parties will work cooperatively to implement this Agreement. The Parties will exchange appropriate
information (for example, maintenance contact numbers, network information, information required to
comply with law enforcement and other security agencies of the government, escalation processes, etc.) to
achieve this desired result.
38.2 Each Party will administer its network to ensure acceptable service levels to all users of its network
services. Service levels are generally considered acceptable only when End Users are able to establish
connections with little or no delay encountered in the network. Each Party will provide a twenty four (24)-
hour contact number for Network Traffic Management issues to the other’s surveillance management
center.
38.3 Each Party maintains the right to implement protective network traffic management controls, such as
“cancel to”, “call gapping” or seven (7)-digit and ten (10)-digit code gaps, to selectively cancel the
completion of traffic over its network, including traffic destined for the other Party’s network, when required
to protect the public-switched network from congestion as a result of occurrences such as facility failures,
switch congestion or failure or focused overload. Each Party shall immediately notify the other Party of any
protective control action planned or executed.
38.4 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be implemented by either Party to
temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling patterns. Reroutes shall
not be used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Expansive controls shall be used only when mutually
agreed to by the Parties.
38.5 The Parties shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding cross-network call-ins expected
to generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these
events on the public-switched network, including any disruption or loss of service to the other Party’s End
Users. Facsimile (FAX) numbers must be exchanged by the Parties to facilitate event notifications for
planned mass calling events.
38.6 Neither Party shall use any Interconnection Service provided under this Agreement or any other service
related thereto or used in combination therewith in any manner that interferes with or impairs service over
any facilities of AT&T-21STATE, its affiliated companies or other connecting telecommunications carriers,
prevents any carrier from using its Telecommunications Service, impairs the quality or the privacy of
Telecommunications Service to other carriers or to either Party’s End Users, causes hazards to either
Party’s personnel or the public, damage to either Party’s or any connecting carrier’s facilities or equipment,
including any malfunction of ordering or billing systems or equipment. Upon such occurrence either Party

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE

may discontinue or refuse service, but only for so long as the other Party is violating this provision. Upon
any such violation, either Party shall provide the other Party notice of the violation at the earliest practicable
time.
38.7 AT&T TENNESSEE hereby commits to provide Disaster Recovery to CLEC according to the plan below.
38.7.1 AT&T TENNESSEE Disaster Recovery Plan
38.7.2 In the unlikely event of a disaster occurring that affects AT&T TENNESSEE’s long-term ability to deliver
traffic to a CLEC, general procedures have been developed by AT&T TENNESSEE to hasten the recovery
process in accordance with the Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program established by the FCC
to identify and prioritize telecommunication services that support national security or emergency
preparedness (NS/EP) missions. A description of the TSP Program as it may be amended from time to time
is available on AT&T TENNESSEE’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. Since each location is
different and could be affected by an assortment of potential problems, a detailed recovery plan is
impractical. However, in the process of reviewing recovery activities for specific locations, some basic
procedures emerge that appear to be common in most cases.
38.7.3 These general procedures should apply to any disaster that affects the delivery of traffic for an extended
time period. Each CLEC will be given the same consideration during an outage, and service will be restored
as quickly as possible. AT&T TENNESSEE reserves the right to make changes to these procedures as
improvements become available or as business conditions dictate.
38.7.4 This plan will cover the basic recovery procedures that would apply to every CLEC.
38.7.5 Single Point of Contact:
38.7.5.1 When a problem is experienced, regardless of the severity, the AT&T TENNESSEE Network
Management Center (NMC) will observe traffic anomalies and begin monitoring the situation.
Controls will be appropriately applied to insure the sanity of AT&T TENNESSEE’s network; and,
in the event that a switch or facility node is lost, the NMC will attempt to circumvent the failure
using available reroutes.
38.7.5.2 AT&T TENNESSEE’s NMC will remain in control of the restoration efforts until the problem has
been identified as being a long-term outage. At that time, the NMC will contact AT&T
TENNESSEE’s ECC and relinquish control of the recovery efforts. Even though the ECC may
take charge of the situation, the NMC will continue to monitor the circumstances and restore
traffic as soon as damaged network elements are revitalized.
38.7.5.3 The telephone number for the AT&T TENNESSEE Network Management Center in Atlanta, as
published in iconectiv’s National Network Management Directory, is 404-321-2516.
38.7.6 Identifying the Problem:
38.7.6.1 During the early stages of problem detection, the NMC will be able to tell which CLECs are
affected by the catastrophe. Further analysis and/or first hand observation will determine if the
disaster has affected CLEC equipment only, AT&T TENNESSEE equipment only or a
combination. The initial restoration activity will be largely determined by the equipment that is
affected.
38.7.6.2 Once the nature of the disaster is determined and after verifying the cause of the problem, the
NMC will initiate reroutes and/or transfers that are jointly agreed upon by the affected CLECs’
Network Management Center and the AT&T TENNESSEE NMC. The type and percentage of
controls used will depend upon available network capacity. Controls necessary to stabilize the
situation will be invoked and the NMC will attempt to re-establish as much traffic as possible.
38.7.6.3 For long-term outages, recovery efforts will be coordinated by the ECC. Traffic controls will
continue to be applied by the NMC until facilities are re-established. As equipment is made

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE
Page 53 of 59
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
available for service, the ECC will instruct the NMC to begin removing the controls and allow
traffic to resume.
38.7.7 Site Control:
38.7.7.1 In the total loss of building use scenario, what likely exists will be a smoking pile of rubble. This
rubble will contain many components that could be dangerous. It could also contain any
personnel on the premises at the time of the disaster. For these reasons, the local fire marshal
with the assistance of the police will control the site until the building is no longer a threat to
surrounding properties and the companies have secured the site from the general public.
38.7.7.2 During this time, the majority owner of the building should be arranging for a demolition
contractor to mobilize to the site with the primary objective of reaching the cable entrance facility
for a damage assessment. The results of this assessment would then dictate immediate plans
for restoration, both short term and permanent.
38.7.7.3 In a less catastrophic event, (i.e., the building is still standing and the cable entrance facility is
usable), the situation is more complex. The site will initially be controlled by local authorities until
the threat to adjacent property has diminished. Once the site is returned to the control of the
companies, the following events should occur:
38.7.7.3.1 An initial assessment of the main building infrastructure systems (mechanical,
electrical, fire and life safety, elevators, and others) will establish building needs.
Once these needs are determined, the majority owner should lead the building
restoration efforts. There may be situations where the site will not be totally
restored within the confines of the building. The companies must individually
determine their needs and jointly assess the cost of permanent restoration to
determine the overall plan of action.
38.7.7.3.2 Multiple restoration trailers from each company will result in the need for
designated space and installation order. This layout and control is required to
maximize the amount of restoration equipment that can be placed at the site, and
the priority of placements.
38.7.7.3.3 Care must be taken in this planning to ensure other restoration efforts have
logistical access to the building. Major components of telephone and building
equipment will need to be removed and replaced. A priority for this equipment
must also be jointly established to facilitate overall site restoration. (Example: If
the AC switchgear has sustained damage, this would be of the highest priority in
order to regain power, lighting, and HVAC throughout the building.)
38.7.7.3.4 If the site will not accommodate the required restoration equipment, the companies
would then need to quickly arrange with local authorities for street closures, rights
of way or other possible options available.
38.7.8 Environmental Concerns:
38.7.8.1 In the worse case scenario, many environmental concerns must be addressed. Along with the
police and fire marshal, the state environmental protection department will be on site to monitor
the situation.
38.7.8.2 Items to be concerned with in a large central office building could include:
38.7.8.2.1 Emergency engine fuel supply. Damage to the standby equipment and the fuel
handling equipment could have created “spill” conditions that have to be handled
within state and federal regulations.
38.7.8.2.2 Asbestos-containing materials that may be spread throughout the wreckage.
Asbestos could be in many components of building, electrical, mechanical, outside
plant distribution, and telephone systems.

Contract Id: 4352361
General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-21STATE

Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
38.7.8.2.3 Lead and acid. These materials could be present in potentially large quantities
depending upon the extent of damage to the power room.
38.7.8.2.4 Mercury and other regulated compounds resident in telephone equipment.
38.7.8.2.5 Other compounds produced by the fire or heat.
38.7.8.3 Once a total loss event occurs at a large site, local authorities will control immediate clean up
(water placed on the wreckage by the fire department) and site access.
38.7.8.4 At some point, the companies will become involved with local authorities in the overall planning
associated with site clean up and restoration. Depending on the clean up approach taken,
delays in the restoration of several hours to several days may occur.
38.7.8.5 In a less severe disaster, items listed above are more defined and can be addressed individually
depending on the damage.
38.7.8.6 In each case, the majority owner should coordinate building and environmental restoration as
well as maintain proper planning and site control.
38.7.9 The ECC (Emergency Control Center):
38.7.9.1 The ECC is located in the Midtown 1 Building in Atlanta, Georgia. During an emergency, the
ECC staff will convene a group of pre-selected experts to inventory the damage and initiate
corrective actions. These experts have regional access to AT&T TENNESSEE’s personnel and
equipment and will assume control of the restoration activity anywhere in the nine-state area.
38.7.9.2 In the past, the ECC has been involved with restoration activities resulting from hurricanes, ice
storms and floods. They have demonstrated their capabilities during these calamities as well as
during outages caused by human error or equipment failures. This group has an excellent
record of restoring service as quickly as possible.
38.7.9.3 During a major disaster, the ECC may move emergency equipment to the affected location,
direct recovery efforts of local personnel and coordinate service restoration activities with the
CLECs. The ECC will attempt to restore service as quickly as possible using whatever means is
available, leaving permanent solutions, such as the replacement of damaged buildings or
equipment, for local personnel to administer.
38.7.9.4 Part of the ECC’s responsibility, after temporary equipment is in place, is to support the NMC
efforts to return service to the CLECs. Once service has been restored, the ECC will return
control of the network to normal operational organizations. Any long-term changes required after
service is restored will be made in an orderly fashion and will be conducted as normal activity.
38.7.10 Recovery Procedures:
38.7.10.1 The nature and severity of any disaster will influence the recovery procedures. One crucial
factor in determining how AT&T TENNESSEE will proceed with restoration is whether or not
AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment is incapacitated. Regardless of whose equipment is out of
service, AT&T TENNESSEE will move as quickly as possible to aid with service recovery;
however, the approach that will be taken may differ depending upon the location of the problem.
38.7.11 CLEC Outage:
38.7.11.1 For a problem limited to one CLEC (or a building with multiple CLECs), AT&T TENNESSEE has
several options available for restoring service quickly. For those CLECs that have agreements
with other CLECs, AT&T TENNESSEE can immediately start directing traffic to a provisional
CLEC for completion. This alternative is dependent upon AT&T TENNESSEE having
concurrence from the affected CLECs.

38.7.11.2 Whether or not the affected CLECs have requested a traffic transfer to another CLEC will not
impact AT&T TENNESSEE’s resolve to re-establish traffic to the original destination as quickly
as possible.
38.7.12 AT&T TENNESSEE Outage:
38.7.12.1 Because AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment has varying degrees of impact on the service
provided to the CLECs, restoring service from damaged AT&T TENNESSEE equipment is
different. The outage will probably impact a number of Carriers simultaneously. However, the
ECC will be able to initiate immediate actions to correct the problem.
38.7.12.2 A disaster involving any of AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment locations could impact the CLECs,
some more than others. A disaster at a Central Office (CO) would only impact the delivery of
traffic to and from that one location, but the incident could affect many Carriers. If the CO is a
Serving Wire Center (SWC), then traffic from the entire area to those Carriers served from that
switch would also be impacted. If the switch functions as an Access Tandem, or there is a
tandem in the building, traffic from every CO to every CLEC could be interrupted. A disaster that
destroys a facility hub could disrupt various traffic flows, even though the switching equipment
may be unaffected.
38.7.12.3 The NMC would be the first group to observe a problem involving AT&T TENNESSEE’s
equipment. Shortly after a disaster, the NMC will begin applying controls and finding re-routes
for the completion of as much traffic as possible. These reroutes may involve delivering traffic to
alternate Carriers upon receiving approval from the CLECs involved. In some cases, changes in
translations will be required. If the outage is caused by the destruction of equipment, then the
ECC will assume control of the restoration.
38.7.13 Loss of a CO:
38.7.13.1 When AT&T TENNESSEE loses a CO, the ECC will
38.7.13.1.1 Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
38.7.13.1.2 Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
38.7.13.1.3 Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken
area, if necessary;
38.7.13.1.4 Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other
emergency agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or the CLEC in
accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T
TENNESSEE Maintenance database prior to the emergency.
38.7.14 Loss of a CO with SWC Functions:
38.7.14.1 The loss of a CO that also serves as a SWC will be restored as described in Section 38.11.13.
38.7.15 Loss of a CO with Tandem Functions:
38.7.15.1 When AT&T TENNESSEE loses a CO building that serves as an Access Tandem and as a
SWC, the ECC will:
38.7.15.1.1 Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
38.7.15.1.2 Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
38.7.15.1.3 Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken
area, if necessary;
38.7.15.1.4 Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other
emergency agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or the CLEC in

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 – ICA – 07/21/14
accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T
TENNESSEE Maintenance database prior to the emergency;
38.7.15.1.5 Re-direct as much traffic as possible to the alternate access tandem (if available)
for delivery to those CLECs utilizing a different location as a SWC;
38.7.15.1.6 Begin aggregating traffic to a location near the damaged building. From this
location, begin re-establishing trunk groups to the CLECs for the delivery of traffic
normally found on the direct trunk groups. (This aggregation point may be the
alternate access tandem location or another CO on a primary facility route.)
38.7.16 Loss of a Facility Hub:
38.7.16.1 In the event that AT&T TENNESSEE loses a facility hub, the recovery process is much the same
as above. Once the NMC has observed the problem and administered the appropriate controls,
the ECC will assume authority for the repairs. The recovery effort will include:
38.7.16.1.1 Placing specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
38.7.16.1.2 Inventorying the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
38.7.16.1.3 Moving containerized emergency equipment to the stricken area, if necessary;
38.7.16.1.4 Reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other emergency
agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or CLEC in accordance with
the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T TENNESSEE
Maintenance database prior to the emergency; and
38.7.16.1.5 If necessary, AT&T TENNESSEE will aggregate the traffic at another location and
build temporary facilities. This alternative would be viable for a location that is
destroyed and building repairs are required.
38.7.17 Combined Outage (CLEC and AT&T TENNESSEE Equipment):
38.7.17.1 In some instances, a disaster may impact AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment as well as the
CLEC’s. This situation will be handled in much the same way as described in Section 38.7.15.
Since AT&T TENNESSEE and the CLEC will be utilizing temporary equipment, close
coordination will be required.
38.7.18 T1 Identification Procedures:
38.7.18.1 During the restoration of service after a disaster, AT&T TENNESSEE may be forced to
aggregate traffic for delivery to a CLEC. During this process, T1 traffic may be consolidated onto
DS3s and may become unidentifiable to the Carrier. Because resources will be limited, AT&T
TENNESSEE may be forced to “package” this traffic entirely differently than normally received by
the CLECs. Therefore, a method for identifying the T1 traffic on the DS3s and providing the
information to the Carriers is required.
38.7.19 Acronyms:
CLEC - Competitive Local Exchange Carrier
CO - Central Office (AT&T TENNESSEE)
DS3 - Facility that carries 28 T1s (672 circuits)
ECC - Emergency Control Center (AT&T TENNESSEE)
NMC - Network Management Center
SWC - Serving Wire Center (AT&T TENNESSEE switch)

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
3.2 Network Interconnection Architecture Plan:
3.2.1 AT&T-21STATE’s network is partly comprised of End Office Switches, Local Only Tandem Switches
(AT&T-10STATE), Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switches, Local/Access Tandem Switches and Access
Tandem Switches. AT&T-21STATE’s network architecture in any given local Exchange Area and/or LATA
can vary markedly from another local Exchange Area/LATA. Using one or more of the NIMs herein, the
Parties will agree to a physical architecture plan for a specific Interconnection area. A physical architecture
plan will, at a minimum, include the location of CLEC’s switch(es) and AT&T-21STATE’s End Office
Switch(es) and/or Tandem Switch(es) to be interconnected, the facilities that will connect the two (2)
networks and which Party will provide (be financially responsible for) the Interconnection facilities. At the
time of implementation in a given local Exchange Area or LATA the plan will be documented and signed by
appropriate representatives of the Parties, indicating their mutual agreement to the physical architecture
plan.
3.2.2 The Parties may utilize any method of Interconnection described in this Attachment. Unless otherwise
specified in this Attachment, each Party is financially responsible for the provisioning of facilities on its side
of the negotiated POI(s). Each Party is responsible for the appropriate sizing, operation and maintenance of
the transport facility to its side of the POI(s). The Parties agree to provide sufficient facilities for the trunk
groups required in Section 4.0 below for the exchange of traffic between CLEC and AT&T-21STATE.
3.2.2.1 For each NXX code used by either Party, the Party that owns the NXX (or pooled code block)
must maintain network facilities (whether owned or leased) used to actively provide, in part, local
Telecommunications Service in the geographic area assigned to such NXX code. If either Party
uses its NXX Code to provide Foreign Exchange (FX) service to its customers outside of the
geographic area assigned to such code, that Party shall be solely responsible to transport traffic
between its Foreign Exchange service customers and such code’s geographic area.
3.2.3 Types of Points of Interconnection:
3.2.3.1 A “Tandem Serving Area (TSA)” is an AT&T-21STATE area defined by the sum of all local
calling areas served by AT&T-21STATE End Offices that subtend an AT&T-21STATE Tandem
for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic as defined in the LERG.
3.2.3.2 The Parties will interconnect their network facilities at a minimum of one CLEC designated POI
within AT&T-21STATE’s network in the LATA where CLEC Offers Service.
3.2.3.3 A “Single POI” is a single point of Interconnection within a LATA on AT&T-21STATE’s network
that is established to interconnect AT&T-21STATE’s network and CLEC’s network for the
exchange of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
3.2.3.4 The Parties agree that CLEC has the right to choose a Single POI or multiple POIs.
3.2.3.5 When CLEC has established a Single POI (or multiple POIs) in a LATA, CLEC agrees to
establish an additional POI:
3.2.3.5.1 at an AT&T-21STATE TSA separate from the existing POI arrangement when traffic
through the existing POI arrangement to that AT&T-21STATE TSA exceeds twenty-
four (24) DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive months; or
3.2.3.5.2 at an AT&T-21STATE End Office in a local calling area not served by an AT&T-
21STATE Tandem for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic when traffic through
the existing POI arrangement to that local calling area exceeds twenty-four (24)
DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive months.
3.2.3.6 The additional POI(s) will be established within ninety (90) calendar days of notification that the
threshold has been met.
3.2.4 A Party seeking to change the physical architecture plan shall provide thirty (30) calendar days advance
written Notice of such intent. After Notice is served, the normal project planning process as described in
Section 3.0 above will be followed for all physical architecture plan changes.

3.2.5 CLEC is solely responsible, including financially, for the facilities that carry Operator Services/Directory
Assistance (“OS/DA”), E911, Mass Calling, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups.
3.2.6 Technical Interfaces:
3.2.6.1 The Interconnection facilities provided by each Party shall be formatted using either Alternate
Mark Inversion (AMI) line code with Superframe format framing or Bipolar 8-Zero Substitution
with Extended Superframe (B8ZS ESF) format framing or any mutually agreeable line coding and
framing.
3.3 Methods of Interconnection:
3.3.1 Physical and Virtual Collocation - Attachment 12 - Collocation describes the terms and conditions for
Interconnection via Collocation.
3.3.2 Leased Entrance Facilities:
3.3.2.1 When CLEC does not elect to collocate transport terminating equipment at an AT&T-21STATE
Tandem or End Office, CLEC may self provision facilities, deploy third party interconnection
facilities, or lease existing Entrance Facilities from AT&T-21STATE.
3.3.2.2 AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC existing Entrance Facilities when used solely for
interconnection purposes within the meaning of Section 251(c)(2) of the Act, i.e., for the
transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and/or exchange access service, at the
rates set forth in the Pricing Sheets. An Entrance Facility is existing if, at the time of CLEC’s
request, the facility is present in AT&T-21STATE’s network and available for use as an Entrance
Facility and no special construction is required.
3.3.2.3 CLEC may not purchase Entrance Facilities pursuant to this Agreement for any other purpose,
including, without limitation (i) as unbundled network elements under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act,
(ii) for backhauling traffic (e.g., to provide a final link in the dedicated transmission path between
CLEC’s customer and CLEC’s switch, or to carry traffic to and from its own end users), or (iii)
911, OS/DA, High Volume Call In (“HVCI”), Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups.
3.3.2.4 CLEC must submit Access Service Requests (“ASRs”) to AT&T-21STATE to perform
conversions for reclassifications of the wholesale service or group of wholesale services to an
Entrance Facility purchased pursuant to this Agreement and at the rates referenced in the Pricing
Sheets. AT&T-21STATE will follow project guidelines as described in Section 4.7.
3.3.2.5 Entrance Facility Audits:
3.3.2.5.1 AT&T-21STATE may audit CLEC’s compliance with the use of Entrance Facilities
for Interconnection purposes by obtaining and paying for an independent auditor to
audit, on no more frequently than an annual basis (consecutive 12 month period
following the commencement of an audit), CLEC’s compliance with the conditions
set forth in Sections 3.3.2.1–3.3.2.4 above (“Entrance Facility Requirements”).
3.3.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will send such Audit Notice to CLEC no less than thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the date upon which AT&T-21STATE seeks to commence an
audit and shall identify the independent auditor.
3.3.2.5.3 The independent auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the
standards established by the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants,
which will require the auditor to perform an “examination engagement” and issue an
opinion that includes the auditor’s determination regarding CLEC’s compliance with
the Entrance Facility Requirements.
3.3.2.5.4 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all
material respects with the Entrance Facility Requirements. AT&T-21STATE shall
provide CLEC with a copy of the independent auditor’s report within ten (10)

business days from the date of receipt. The independent auditor’s report shall state
the scope of the audit that was performed.
3.3.2.5.5 If the auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with the Entrance Facility
Requirements, CLEC must:
3.3.2.5.5.1 submit orders to AT&T-21STATE to either convert all noncompliant
Entrance Facilities to the equivalent or substantially similar wholesale
service or disconnect non-compliant facilities within 45 days of the
date CLEC receives a copy of the auditor’s report;
3.3.2.5.5.2 remit payment in accordance with the payment provisions of the
Agreement for true-up charges assessed by AT&T-21STATE for the
difference between the amount billed by AT&T-21STATE and the
amount that AT&T-21STATE would have billed had CLEC purchased
the Entrance Facilities from the applicable AT&T-21STATE tariff at
month-to-month rates plus late payment charges from the date that
the noncompliance of the Entrance Facility Requirements, in whole or
in part, began. AT&T-21STATE reserves its rights to make the
effective bill date for conversions 45 days after CLEC’s receipt of a
copy of the auditor’s report;
3.3.2.5.5.3 reimburse AT&T-21STATE for 100% of the cost of the independent
auditor if the number of circuits found to be non-compliant is 10% or
greater than the number of circuits investigated. If the number of
circuits found to be non-compliant is less than 10%, CLEC will
reimburse AT&T-21STATE in an amount that is in direct proportion to
the number of circuits found to be non-compliant.
3.3.2.5.6 With respect to any noncompliant Entrance Facility for which CLEC fails to submit a
conversion or disconnect order or dispute the auditor’s finding to the Commission
within such 45-day time period, AT&T-21STATE may initiate and effect such a
conversion. AT&T-21STATE will take reasonable steps to avoid disruption to
CLEC’s customers’ service or degradation in service quality in the case of
conversion. AT&T-21STATE reserves its rights to make the effective bill date for
conversions 45 days after CLEC’s receipt of a copy of the auditor’s report. In no
event shall rates set under Section 252(d)(1) apply for the use of any Entrance
Facility for any period in which the Entrance Facility does not meet the Entrance
Facility Requirements.
3.3.2.5.7 If CLEC disagrees as to the findings or conclusions of the auditor’s report, CLEC
shall provide Notice requesting dispute resolution to AT&T-21STATE. Such dispute
resolution discussions shall be completed with fourteen (14) days. The Dispute
Resolution process set forth in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement
shall not apply to a dispute of the findings or conclusions of the auditor’s report. At
the conclusion of this fourteen (14) day period, CLEC may file a complaint at the
Commission.
3.3.2.5.8 If CLEC initiates a proceeding at the Commission, CLEC may elect to pay into an
escrow account the true up amount, and on a monthly basis prospectively the
difference between the rates set forth in the Agreement and the month-to-month
rates in the applicable AT&T-21STATE tariff in lieu of AT&T converting the Entrance
Facilities identified in CLEC’s dispute resolution before the Commission pending
resolution. If the Commission upholds the auditor’s finding, the disputed amounts
held in escrow shall be paid to AT&T-21STATE and AT&T-21STATE shall retain
any disputed amounts already paid by CLEC in addition to late payment charges.

3.3.3 Fiber Meet Point:
3.3.3.1 Fiber Meet Point between AT&T-21STATE and CLEC can occur at any mutually agreeable and
technically feasible point at an AT&T-21STATE Tandem or End Office building within each
LATA.
3.3.3.2 When the Parties agree to Interconnect their networks pursuant to the Fiber Meet Point, a single
point-to-point linear chain SONET system must be utilized (in a Unidirectional Path Switched
Ring (UPSR) software configuration for AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE). Only Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be provisioned over this jointly provided facility.
3.3.3.3 Neither Party will be allowed to access the Data Communications Channel (DCC) of the other
Party’s Fiber Optic Terminal (FOT). The Fiber Meet Point will be designed so that each Party
may, as far as is technically feasible, independently select the transmission, multiplexing and
fiber terminating equipment to be used on its side of the POI(s). The Parties will work
cooperatively to achieve equipment and vendor compatibility of the FOT equipment.
3.3.3.4 Requirements for Interconnection specifications will be defined in joint engineering planning
sessions between the Parties.
3.3.3.5 In addition to the semi-annual trunk forecast process, discussed in Section 4.0 below,
discussions to provide relief to existing facilities can be initiated by either Party. Actual system
augmentations will be initiated only upon mutual agreement. Facilities will be planned to
accommodate the verified and agreed upon trunk forecast for the Local Interconnection Trunk
Group(s).
3.3.3.6 The Parties will negotiate a project service date and corresponding work schedule to construct
relief facilities prior to facilities exhaust.
3.3.3.7 CLEC will provide fiber cable to the last entrance (or AT&T-21STATE designated) manhole at
the AT&T-21STATE Tandem or End Office building. AT&T-21STATE shall make all necessary
preparations in the manhole to receive and to allow and enable CLEC to deliver fiber optic
facilities into that manhole. CLEC will provide a sufficient length of fiber cable for AT&T-
21STATE to pull through to the AT&T-21STATE cable vault. CLEC shall deliver and maintain
such strands at its own expense up to the POI. AT&T shall take the fiber from the manhole and
terminate it inside AT&T-21STATE’s Tandem or End Office building at the cable vault at AT&T-
21STATE’s expense. In this case, the POI shall be at the AT&T-21STATE designated manhole
location. Each Party shall provide its own source for the synchronized timing of its FOT
equipment.
3.3.3.8 CLEC and AT&T-21STATE will mutually agree on the capacity of the FOT(s) to be utilized based
on equivalent DS1s or DS3s. Each Party will also agree upon the optical frequency and
wavelength necessary to implement the Interconnection. The Parties will develop and agree
upon methods for the capacity planning and management for these facilities, terms and
conditions for over provisioning facilities and the necessary processes to implement facilities as
indicated in Section 4.0 below of this document.
3.3.3.9 Electrical handoffs for Fiber Meet Point will be at the DS1 or DS3 level. When a DS3 handoff is
agreed to by the Parties, AT&T-21STATE will provide any multiplexing required for DS1 facilities
or trunking at its end and CLEC will provide any DS1 multiplexing required for facilities or trunking
at its end.
3.4 Responsibilities of the Parties:
3.4.1 For each local Interconnection within an AT&T-21STATE area, CLEC shall provide written notice to AT&T-
21STATE of the need to establish Interconnection in each local Exchange Area (AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE) or LATA (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE). CLEC shall provide all applicable network information on

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-21STATE
Page 10 of 36
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
forms acceptable to AT&T-21STATE (as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s CLEC Handbook, published on the
AT&T CLEC Online website).
3.4.2 Upon receipt of CLEC’s Notice to interconnect, the Parties shall schedule a meeting to document the
network architecture (including trunking) as discussed in Section 3.2.1 above. The Interconnection
Activation Date for an Interconnection shall be established based on then-existing force and load, the scope
and complexity of the requested Interconnection and other relevant factors.
3.4.3 Either Party may add or remove switches. The Parties shall provide one hundred and twenty (120) calendar
days written Notice to establish such Interconnection; and the terms and conditions of this Attachment will
apply to such Interconnection.
3.4.4 The Parties recognize that a facility handoff point must be agreed upon to establish the demarcation point
for maintenance and provisioning responsibilities for each Party on its side of the POI.
4.0 Interconnection Trunking
4.1 Provisioning and Administration of Trunk Groups:
4.1.1 CLEC shall issue ASRs for two-way trunk groups and for one-way trunk groups originating at CLEC’s
switch. AT&T-21STATE shall issue ASRs for one-way trunk groups originating at the AT&T-21STATE
switch.
4.1.2 Trunk groups for ancillary services (e.g., OS/DA, BLVI, High Volume Call In and E911) and Meet Point or
Third Party (as appropriate) Trunk Groups can be established between CLEC’s switch and the appropriate
AT&T-21STATE Tandem Switch as further provided in this Section 4.0.
4.1.3 Signaling Protocol:
4.1.3.1 SS7 Signaling is AT&T-21STATE’s preferred method for signaling. Where MF signaling is
currently used, the Parties agree to use their best efforts to convert to SS7. If SS7 services are
provided by AT&T-21STATE, they will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable access tariffs.
4.1.3.2 Where MF signaling is currently used, the Parties agree to interconnect their networks using MF
or dual tone MF (DTMF) signaling, subject to availability at the End Office Switch or Tandem
Switch at which Interconnection occurs. The Parties acknowledge that the use of MF signaling
may not be optimal. AT&T-21STATE will not be responsible for correcting any undesirable
characteristics, service problems or performance problems that are associated with MF/SS7
inter-working or the signaling protocol required for Interconnection with CLEC employing MF
signaling.
4.1.4 The number of digits to be exchanged by the Parties shall be ten (10) unless otherwise mutually agreed.
4.1.5 Where available, a trunk group utilization report (TIKI) may be accessed from the AT&T CLEC Online
website. The report is provided in an MS-Excel format.
4.2 Embedded Base-One-Way trunks (AT&T-12STATE only):
4.2.1 AT&T-12STATE acknowledges that CLEC may have an embedded base of one-way trunks ordered and
installed prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement that were used for termination of CLEC’s Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic to AT&T-12STATE (Embedded Base). To the extent that CLEC has such
an Embedded Base, CLEC shall only augment trunk groups in the Embedded Base with the mutual
agreement of the Parties. CLEC shall not order any new one-way trunk groups following the Effective Date
of this Agreement. Moreover, the Parties agree that the Embedded Base will be converted to two-way trunk
groups under the following circumstances:
4.2.1.1 With reasonable notification from AT&T-12STATE and upon AT&T-12STATE’s request, CLEC
shall convert all of its Embedded Base to two-way trunks.

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
4.2.1.2 At any time an Embedded Base trunk group (either originating or terminating) requires
augmentation, AT&T-12STATE can require the associated originating and terminating trunks to
be converted to a single two-way trunk group prior to the augmentation.
4.2.1.3 When any network changes are to be performed on a project basis (i.e., central office
conversions, tandem re-homes, etc.), upon request and reasonable notice by AT&T-12STATE,
CLEC will convert all of its Embedded Base affected by the project within the intervals and due
dates required by the project parameters.
4.2.1.4 In addition to the foregoing, CLEC may choose, at any time, to convert its Embedded Base to
two-way trunk groups.
4.2.1.5 The Parties will coordinate any trunk group migration, trunk group prioritization and
implementation schedule. AT&T-12STATE agrees to develop a cutover plan within thirty (30)
days of notification to CLEC of the need to convert pursuant to Section 4.2.1.1 above and Section
4.2.1.3 above.
4.3 Establishment of Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Groups Per Region:
4.3.1 When CLEC Offers Service in a Local Exchange Area or LATA, the following trunk groups described in this
Section 4.3 shall be used to transport traffic between CLEC End Users and AT&T-21STATE End Users.
4.3.2 Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each Local Exchange Area: AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE. These trunk groups will utilize SS7 where available and multi-frequency (MF) signaling
protocol where SS7 is not available.
4.3.2.1 A two-way Local Only Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch in the local Exchange Area. Inter-
Tandem switching is not provided.
4.3.2.2 A two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and
each AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switch and each
Local/Access Tandem Switch in the local Exchange Area. Inter-Tandem switching is not
provided.
4.3.2.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE reserves the right to initiate a one-way IntraLATA Trunk
Group to CLEC in order to provide Tandem relief when a community of interest is outside the
local Exchange Area in which CLEC is interconnected.
4.3.2.4 Where traffic from CLEC switch to an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office is
sufficient (24 or more trunks), a Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall also be established to
the AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office. Once such trunks are provisioned,
traffic from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE must be redirected to route first to
the Direct End Office Trunk Group (DEOT) with overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic. If an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic,
a direct final DEOT will be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.3.2.5 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s switch to each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office in a local Exchange Area that has no Local
Tandem. This trunk group shall be established as a direct final.
4.3.2.6 When AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has a separate Local Only Tandem Switch(es) in
the local Exchange Area and a separate Access Tandem Switch that serves the same local
Exchange Area, a two-way IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group shall be established to the AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Access Tandem Switch. In addition a two-way Local Only

Page 12 of 36
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
Trunk Group(s) shall be established from CLEC’s switch to each AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION
5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch.
4.3.2.7 Each Party shall deliver to the other Party over the Local Only Trunk Group(s) only such traffic
that originates and terminates in the same local exchange area.
4.3.3 Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each LATA: AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE:
4.3.3.1 Tandem Trunking - AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE:
4.3.3.1.1 Section 251(b)(5) and ISP Bound Traffic shall be routed on Local Only Trunk Groups
established at all AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-
STATE Local Only Tandems in the LATA for calls destined to or from all AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE End Offices that subtend the designated Tandem.
These trunk groups shall be two-way and will utilize SS7 signaling.
4.3.3.1.2 In AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE all
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on two-way Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups using SS7 signaling. These trunk groups shall be
established at all Local/IntraLATA and Local/Access Tandem switches in AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and at the Access Tandem Switches in AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE in the LATA, for calls destined to or from End Offices that
subtend each Tandem.
4.3.3.1.3 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s switch to
each AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and each AT&T WEST REGION 2-
STATE End Office in any LATA where the AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and
AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE Local Tandem. This trunk
group shall be established as a direct final.
4.3.3.2 Tandem Trunking - AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE:
4.3.3.2.1 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups established at each AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access
Tandem in the LATA where CLEC homes its NPA/NXX codes for calls destined to or
from all AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE End Offices that subtend the
designated Tandem. These trunk groups shall be one-way except where two-way
trunks have been mutually agreed and will utilize SS7 signaling. Where CLEC does
not interconnect at every Access Tandem switch location in the LATA, CLEC must
use Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic to End Users through those
Tandems within the LATA to which CLEC is not interconnected. To utilize MTA,
CLEC must establish Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to a minimum of one (1)
Access Tandem within each LATA as required. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE will route CLEC originated 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll traffic for LATA-wide
transport and termination. Compensation for MTA is described in Section 6.4 below.
4.3.4 Direct End Office Trunking:
4.3.4.1 DEOTs transport Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic between CLEC’s switch and an AT&T-
21STATE End Office and are not switched at a Tandem location. When actual or projected End
Office Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks CLEC
shall establish the following:
4.3.4.1.1 a two-way DEOT in AT&T-12STATE;
4.3.4.1.2 a one-way DEOT in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE (except where the
parties have agreed to use two-way trunks.)

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
4.3.4.2 Once such trunks are provisioned, traffic from CLEC to AT&T-21STATE must be redirected to
route first to the DEOT with overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate AT&T-21STATE
Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. If an AT&T-21STATE End Office
does not subtend an AT&T-21STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic, a direct final DEOT will be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.3.4.3 All traffic received by AT&T-21STATE on the DEOT from CLEC must terminate in the End Office,
(i.e., no Tandem switching will be performed in the End Office). Where End Office functionality is
provided in a remote End Office switch of a host/remote configuration, CLEC shall establish the
DEOT at the host switch.
4.3.5 Meet Point Trunk Group - AT&T-12STATE:
4.3.5.1 IXC carried traffic shall be transported between CLEC’s switch and the AT&T-12STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch over a Meet Point Trunk Group separate from
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The Meet Point Trunk Group will be established for the
transmission and routing of exchange access traffic between CLEC’s End Users and IXCs via an
AT&T-12STATE Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.5.2 Meet Point Trunk Groups shall be provisioned as two-way and each Party is responsible for
delivering traffic utilizing SS7 signaling, except MF signaling will be used on a separate Meet
Point Trunk Group to complete originating calls to switched access customers that use MF FGD
signaling protocol.
4.3.5.3 When AT&T-12STATE has more than one Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch in a local
exchange area or LATA, CLEC shall establish a Meet Point Trunk Group to every AT&T-
12STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch where CLEC has homed its NXX code(s) or is
the code holder of a pooled code block.
4.3.5.4 AT&T-12STATE will not block switched access traffic delivered to any AT&T-12STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch for completion on CLEC’s network. The Parties
understand and agree that Meet Point trunking arrangements are available and functional only
to/from switched access customers who directly connect with any AT&T-12STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch that CLEC’s switch subtends in each LATA. In
no event will AT&T-12STATE be required to route such traffic through more than one of its
Tandem Switches for connection to/from switched access customers. AT&T-12STATE shall
have no responsibility to ensure that any switched access customer will accept traffic that CLEC
directs to the switched access customer.
4.3.5.5 CLEC shall provide all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, charge number and
originating line information (OLI). For terminating FGD, AT&T-12STATE will pass all SS7
signaling information including, without limitation, Calling Party Number (CPN) if it receives CPN
from FGD carriers. All privacy indicators will be honored. Where available, network signaling
information such as transit network selection (TNS) parameter, carrier identification codes (CIC)
(CCS platform) and CIC/OZZ information (non SS7 environment) will be provided by CLEC
wherever such information is needed for call routing or billing. The Parties will follow all Ordering
and Billing Forum (OBF) adopted standards pertaining to TNS and CIC/OZZ codes.
4.3.5.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall be
delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating Party’s
access tariff(s).
4.3.6 Third Party Trunk Group - AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE:
4.3.6.1 Third Party Traffic trunks shall be two-way trunks and must be ordered by CLEC to deliver and
receive Third Party Traffic. Establishing Third Party Traffic trunks at Access and Local Tandems
provides Intra-Tandem Access to the Third Party also interconnected at those Tandems. CLEC

shall be responsible for all recurring and nonrecurring charges associated with Third Party Traffic
trunks and facilities.
4.3.7 800/(8YY) Traffic - AT&T-21STATE:
4.3.7.1 If CLEC chooses AT&T-21STATE to handle 800/(8YY) database queries from AT&T-21STATE’s
switches, all CLEC originating 800/(8YY) traffic will be routed over the Meet Point Trunk Groups
or the Third Party Trunk Groups. This traffic will include a combination of both IXC 800/(8YY)
service and CLEC 800/(8YY) service which will be identified and segregated by carrier through
the database query function in the AT&T-21STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.7.2 Where CLEC requests that AT&T-21STATE perform the Service Switching Point (SSP) function
(e.g., the database query) on originating Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls, all such calls shall be
delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk Group or over the Third Party Trunk
Group. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit Code (to be determined for each LATA) shall be used for
all such calls.
4.3.7.3 CLEC may handle its own 800/(8YY) database queries from its own switch. Where it does so,
CLEC will determine the nature of the 800/(8YY) call (local/intraLATA or IXC-carried) based on
the response from the database. If the query determines that the call is a local or IntraLATA
800/(8YY) number, CLEC will route the post-query local or IntraLATA converted ten-digit local
number to AT&T-21STATE over the Local Interconnection Trunk Group and shall provide an
800/(8YY) billing Record to AT&T-21STATE. If the query reveals the call is an IXC-carried
800/(8YY) number, CLEC shall route the post-query IXC-carried call (800/(8YY) number) directly
from its switch for carriers interconnected with its network or over the Meet Point Trunk Group or
Third Party Trunk Group, as appropriate, to carriers not directly connected to its network but
which are connected to AT&T-21STATE’s Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch. Calls will be
routed to AT&T-21STATE over the appropriate trunk group as defined above, within the LATA in
which the calls originate.
4.3.7.4 All post-query Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC performs the SSP function, if
delivered to AT&T-21STATE, shall be delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk
Group or over the Third Party Trunk Group for calls destined to IXCs, or shall be delivered by
CLEC using GR-317 format over the Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group for
calls destined to End Offices that directly subtend the Tandem.
4.3.8 E911 Trunk Group:
4.3.8.1 Attachment 05 - 911/E911 specifies E911 trunk group requirements.
4.3.9 High Volume Call In (HVCI)/Mass Calling (Choke) Trunk Group - AT&T-21STATE:
4.3.9.1 CLEC must establish a dedicated trunk group to the designated Public Response HVCI/Mass
Calling Network Access Tandem in each Serving Area. This trunk group shall be one-way
outgoing only and shall utilize MF signaling. As the HVCI/Mass Calling trunk group is designed
to block all excessive attempts toward HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs, it is necessarily exempt from
the one percent (1%) blocking standard described elsewhere in this Attachment. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group. The Parties
will not exchange live traffic until successful testing is completed by both Parties.
4.3.9.1.1 Upon demonstration that the CLEC switch is unable to utilize MF signaling, the
CLEC may utilize SS7 signaling for its HVCI/Mass Calling Trunk Group.
4.3.9.2 The HVCI trunk group shall be sized as follows:
Number of Access Lines Served Number of Mass Calling Trunks
0 – 10,000 2
10,001 – 20,000 3

4.3.9.3 If CLEC should acquire a HVCI/Mass Calling customer, (e.g., a radio station) CLEC shall notify
AT&T-21STATE at least sixty (60) days in advance of the need to establish a one-way outgoing
SS7 or MF trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE HVCI/Mass Calling Serving Office to the CLEC
End User’s serving office. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs
on this one-way trunk group.
4.3.9.4 If CLEC finds it necessary to issue a new choke telephone number to a new or existing
HVCI/Mass Calling customer, CLEC may request a meeting to coordinate with AT&T-21STATE
the assignment of the HVCI/Mass Calling telephone number from the existing choke NXX. In the
event that the CLEC establishes a new choke NXX, CLEC must notify AT&T-21STATE a
minimum of ninety (90) days prior to deployment of the new HVCI/Mass Calling NXX. AT&T-
21STATE will perform the necessary translations in its End Offices and Tandem(s) and issue
ASRs to establish a one-way outgoing SS7 or MF trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE Public
Response HVCI/Mass Calling Network Access Tandem to CLEC’s choke serving office.
4.3.10 Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services Trunk Group(s):
4.3.10.1 Attachment 06 - Customer Information Services specifies the trunk group requirements for
Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services.
4.4 Trunk Forecasting Responsibilities:
4.4.1 CLEC agrees to provide an initial forecast for all trunk groups described in this Attachment. AT&T-
21STATE shall review this trunk forecast and provide any additional information that may impact the trunk
forecast information provided by CLEC. Subsequent trunk forecasts shall be provided on a semi-annual
basis, not later than January 1st and July 1st of each year in order to be considered in the semi-annual
publication of the AT&T-21STATE General Trunk Forecast. Parties agree to the use of Common Language
Location Identification (CLLI) coding and Common Language Circuit Identification for Message Trunk coding
(CLCI-MSG) which is described in TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES documents BR795-100-100 and BR795-
400-100 respectively. Inquiries pertaining to use of TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Common Language
Standards and document availability should be directed to TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-
2673.
4.4.2 The semi-annual forecasts shall include:
4.4.2.1 Yearly forecasted trunk quantities for all trunk groups required in this Attachment for a minimum
of three (3) (current plus two (2) future) years; and
4.4.2.2 A description of major network projects anticipated for the next six (6) months. Major network
projects include trunking or network rearrangements, shifts in anticipated traffic patterns, orders
greater than eight (8) DS1s, or other activities that are reflected by a significant increase or
decrease in trunking demand for the following forecasting period.
4.4.2.3 The Parties shall agree on these forecasts to ensure efficient trunk utilization. For forecast
quantities that are in dispute, the Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to develop a mutually
agreeable forecast.
4.4.2.4 Orders for trunks that exceed forecasted quantities for forecasted locations will be
accommodated as mutually agreed to by the Parties. The Parties shall make all reasonable
efforts and cooperate in good faith to develop alternative solutions to accommodate these orders.

4.4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting two-way trunk groups. AT&T-21STATE shall be responsible for
forecasting the one-way trunk groups terminating to CLEC and CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting
the one-way trunk groups terminating to AT&T-21STATE, unless otherwise specified in this Attachment.
4.4.4 Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact for planning and forecasting purposes.
4.5 Trunk Design Blocking Criteria:
4.5.1 Trunk requirements for forecasting and servicing shall be based on the blocking objectives shown in the
Table below. Trunk requirements shall be based upon time consistent average busy season busy hour
twenty (20) day averaged loads applied to industry standard Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity
algorithms (using Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness factor until actual traffic data is
available).
Trunk Group Type Design Blocking Objective
Local Interconnection Trunk Group – Direct End Office (Primary High) ECCS1
Local Interconnection Trunk Group – Direct End Office (Final) 2%
IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 1%
Local Interconnection Trunk Group (Local Tandem) 1%
Meet Point (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) (AT&T-12STATE 0.5%
only)
E911 1%
Operator Services (DA/DACC) 1%
Operator Services (0+, 0-) 1%
Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt 1%
Third Party (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE only) 1%
4.6 Trunk Servicing:
4.6.1 Both Parties will jointly manage the capacity of Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet
Point Trunk Groups. Either Party may send a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to the other Party to
trigger changes to the Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups based
on capacity assessment. The TGSR is a standard industry support interface developed by the OBF of the
Carrier Liaison Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions (ATIS) organization.
TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Special Report STS000316 describes the format and use of the TGSR.
Contact TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-2673 regarding the documentation availability and
use of this form.
4.6.2 Orders greater than eight (8) DS1s shall be submitted as a project as described in Section 4.7 below.
4.6.3 Utilization: Utilization shall be defined as Trunks Required as a percentage of Trunks In Service.
4.6.3.1 In A Blocking Situation (Over-utilization):
4.6.3.1.1 In a blocking situation, CLEC is responsible for issuing ASRs on all two-way Local
Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups and one-way
CLEC originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce
measured blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk
group data. If an ASR is not issued, AT&T-21STATE will issue a TGSR. CLEC will
issue an ASR within three (3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR.
CLEC will note “Service Affecting” on the ASR.
1 During implementation the Parties will mutually agree on an Economic Centum Call Seconds (ECCS) or some other means for the sizing of this trunk group.

4.6.3.1.2 In a blocking situation, AT&T-21STATE is responsible for issuing ASRs on one-way
AT&T-21STATE originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups
to reduce measured blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis
of trunk group data. If an ASR is not issued, CLEC will issue a TGSR. AT&T-
21STATE will issue an ASR within three (3) business days after receipt and review
of the TGSR.
4.6.3.1.3 If an alternate final Local Only Trunk Group or Local Interconnection Trunk Group is
at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC for the final
trunk group and all subtending high usage trunk groups that are contributing any
amount of overflow to the alternate final route.
4.6.3.1.4 If a direct final Meet Point Trunk Group is at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a
TGSR may be sent to CLEC. If a direct final Third Party Trunk Group is at ninety
percent (90%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC.
4.6.3.2 Underutilization:
4.6.3.2.1 Underutilization of Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups,
Third Party Trunk Group and Meet Point Trunk Groups exists when provisioned
capacity is greater than the current need. Those situations where more capacity
exists than actual usage requires will be handled in the following manner:
4.6.3.2.1.1 If a Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk Group, Third
Party Trunk Group or a Meet Point Trunk Group is under sixty-five
percent (65%) of CCS capacity on a monthly average basis for AT&T-
12STATE or under eighty percent (80%) for AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE, for each month of any three (3) consecutive
months period, either Party may request the issuance of an order to
resize the Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk
Group, Third Party Trunk Group or the Meet Point Trunk Group, which
shall be left with not less than twenty-five percent (25%) excess
capacity for AT&T-12STATE or not less than fifteen percent (15%) for
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. In all cases, grade of
service objectives shall be maintained.
4.6.3.2.1.2 Either Party may send a TGSR to the other Party to trigger changes to
the Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups,
Third Party Trunk Groups or Meet Point Trunk Groups based on
capacity assessment. Upon receipt of a TGSR, the receiving Party
will issue an ASR to the other Party within twenty (20) business days
after receipt of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.3 Upon review of the TGSR, if a Party does not agree with the resizing,
the Parties will schedule a joint planning discussion within the twenty
(20) business days. The Parties will meet to resolve and mutually
agree to the disposition of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.4 If AT&T-21STATE does not receive an ASR, or if CLEC does not
respond to the TGSR by scheduling a joint discussion within the
twenty (20) business day period, AT&T-21STATE will attempt to
contact CLEC to schedule a joint planning discussion. If CLEC will
not agree to meet within an additional five (5) business days and
present adequate reason for keeping trunks operational, AT&T-
21STATE reserves the right to issue ASRs to resize the Local Only
Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, Third Party Trunk
Groups or Meet Point Trunk Groups.

4.6.4 The Parties will process trunk service requests submitted via a properly completed ASR within ten (10)
business days of receipt of such ASR unless defined as a major project. Incoming orders will be screened
by AT&T-21STATE for reasonableness based upon current utilization and/or consistency with forecasts. If
the nature and necessity of an order requires determination, the ASR will be placed in held status and a joint
planning discussion conducted. The Parties agree to expedite this discussion in order to minimize delay in
order processing. Extension of this review and discussion process beyond two (2) Business Days from ASR
receipt will require the ordering Party to supplement the order with proportionally adjusted Customer Desired
Due Dates. Facilities must also be in place before trunk orders can be completed.
4.7 Projects:
4.7.1 Projects require the coordination and execution of multiple orders or related activities between and among
AT&T-21STATE and CLEC work groups, including but not limited to the initial establishment of Local Only,
Local Interconnection, Third Party or Meet Point Trunk Groups and service in an area, NXX code moves,
rehomes, facility grooming, or network rearrangements.
4.7.1.1 Orders that comprise a project (i.e., greater than eight (8) DS1s) shall be submitted at the same
time and their implementation shall be jointly planned and coordinated.
4.7.2 Projects - Tandem Rehomes/Switch Conversion/Major Network Projects:
4.7.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will advise CLEC of all projects significantly affecting CLEC trunking. Such
projects may include Tandem Rehomes, Switch Conversions and other major network changes.
An Accessible Letter with project details will be issued at least six (6) months prior to the project
due dates. AT&T-21STATE may follow with a TGSR approximately four (4) to six (6) months
before the due date of the project. A separate TGSR will be issued for each CLEC trunk group
and will specify the required CLEC ASR issue date. Failure to submit ASR(s) by the required
date may result in AT&T-21STATE ceasing to deliver traffic until the ASR(s) are received and
processed.
5.0 Out of Exchange Traffic
5.1 Interconnection services are available for the purposes of exchanging traffic to/from a non-AT&T-21STATE
incumbent exchange in accordance with this Section 5.0.
5.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-21STATE is only obligated to make available Interconnection under
Section 251(c)(2) of the Act to CLEC at technically feasible points within AT&T-21STATE’s network and not in
locations, such as territories of other ILECs, where AT&T-21STATE does not maintain a network. Other
Attachments to this Agreement set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-21STATE agrees to
provide CLEC with access to Unbundled Network Elements under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under
Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) of the Act in AT&T-21STATE’s incumbent local
Exchange Areas for the provision of CLEC’s Telecommunications Services.
5.3 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC intends to operate and/or provide Telecommunications Services outside of
AT&T-21STATE incumbent local Exchange Areas and desires to interconnect OE-LEC’s network with AT&T-
21STATE’s network(s).
5.4 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC agrees to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE pursuant to Section 251(a) of
the Act.
5.5 Network Connections For Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.5.1 OE-LEC represents that it operates as a CLEC within AT&T-21STATE Exchange Areas and has a POI
located within AT&T-21STATE Exchange Areas for the purpose of providing telephone Exchange Service
and Exchange Access in such AT&T-21STATE Exchange Areas. Based upon the foregoing, the Parties
agree that AT&T-21STATE’s originating traffic will be delivered to OE-LEC’s existing POI arrangements in
the LATA where the traffic originates in accordance with the POI requirements set forth in this Agreement.
AT&T-21STATE will accept OE-LEC’s Out of Exchange Traffic at its Tandem Switch over local
interconnection facilities that currently exist or may exist in the future between the Parties to or from OE-

LEC’s out of Exchange Areas to or from AT&T-21STATE’s End Offices. When such Out of Exchange
Traffic is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that is exchanged
between the End Users of OE-LEC and AT&T-21STATE, the Parties agree to establish a direct End Office
trunk group when traffic levels exceed one DS1 (24 DS0s) to or from an AT&T-21STATE End Office.
5.5.2 OE-LEC shall establish a trunk group for Out of Exchange Traffic from OE-LEC to each AT&T-21STATE
serving Tandem in a LATA. This requirement may be waived upon mutual agreement of the Parties.
5.5.2.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, where CLEC does not interconnect at every AT&T
serving Tandem in a LATA, CLEC must use Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic in
accordance with Section 4.3.3.3.1 above.
5.5.3 Transport facilities for 911, Mass Calling, OS/DA, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups are the
responsibility of OE-LEC from OE-LEC to the serving Tandem or platform that provides each such service
type.
5.5.4 OE-LEC shall route originating Out of Exchange Traffic to the serving Tandem as defined by the Tandem
owner in the LERG.
5.5.5 If AT&T-21STATE is not the serving Tandem as reflected in the LERG, the OE-LEC shall route Out of
Exchange Traffic directly to the serving AT&T-21STATE End Office.
5.5.6 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.0, for OE-LEC originated/AT&T-21STATE terminated traffic
or AT&T-21STATE originated/ OE-LEC terminated traffic, if any such traffic is improperly routed by one
Party over any trunk groups to the other Party and/or not routed in accordance with this Section 5.0, the
Parties will work cooperatively to correct the problem.
5.5.7 AT&T-21STATE shall not compensate any Third Party Local Exchange Carrier and/or Telecommunications
Carrier for any traffic that is inappropriately routed to AT&T-21STATE (as reflected in the LERG). The
obligation to correctly route traffic also includes traffic that is destined to End Offices that do not subtend an
AT&T-21STATE Tandem. Any compensation due AT&T-21STATE for such misrouted traffic shall be paid
by OE-LEC. AT&T-21STATE shall provide notice to OE-LEC pursuant to the Notices provisions of this
Agreement that such misrouting has occurred. In the notice, OE-LEC shall be given thirty (30) calendar
days to cure such misrouting.
5.5.8 Neither Party shall deliver traffic destined to terminate at the other Party’s End Office via a Third Party
ILEC’s End Office or Tandem.
5.5.9 Connection of a trunk group from OE-LEC to AT&T-21STATE’s Tandem(s) will provide OE-LEC access to
End Offices, IXCs, LECs, CMRS providers and NXXs which subtend that Tandem(s). Connection of a trunk
group from one Party to the other Party’s End Office(s) will provide the connecting Party access only to the
NXXs served by that individual End Office(s) to which the connecting Party interconnects. Direct End Office
Trunk groups that connect the Parties End Office(s) shall provide the Parties access only to the NXXs that
are served by that End Office(s).
5.5.9.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OE-LEC does not choose Access Tandem
interconnection at every AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem within a LATA,
OE-LEC must utilize AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s MTA Interconnection. To utilize
MTA, OE-LEC must establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at a minimum of one AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem within each LATA as required.
5.5.10 AT&T-21STATE will open OE-LEC NPA-NXX codes, rated to or identified to reside in non-AT&T-21STATE
Exchange Areas, in AT&T-21STATE Tandems and End Offices using AT&T-21STATE’s standard code
opening timeframes.
5.6 Intercarrier Compensation for Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.6.1 The compensation arrangement for Out of Exchange Traffic exchanged between the Parties is described in
Section 6.0 below.

5.7 InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic:
5.7.1 AT&T-21STATE will exchange AT&T-21STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic that is covered by an
FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver. AT&T-21STATE will exchange such traffic
using two-way direct final trunk groups (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI in the originating LATA, or (ii) via a
facility meet point arrangement at or near the Exchange Area Boundary (EAB), (iii) via a mutually agreed to
meet point facility within the AT&T-21STATE Exchange Area covered under such InterLATA waiver, or (iv)
via another mutually agreeable method. If the exchange where the traffic is terminating is not an AT&T-
21STATE exchange, AT&T-21STATE shall exchange such traffic using a two-way Direct Final (DF) trunk
group (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI within the originating LATA, (ii) via a mutually agreed to facility meet
point arrangement at or near the EAB, or (iii) via another mutually agreeable method. AT&T-21STATE will
not provision or be responsible for facilities located outside of AT&T-21STATE Exchange Areas.
5.7.2 The Parties agree that the AT&T-21STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic from each AT&T-21STATE
End Office will not overflow to an alternate route.
5.7.3 OE-LEC must provide AT&T-21STATE a separate Access Customer Terminal Location (ACTL) and Local
Routing Number (LRN) specific to each InterLATA local calling arrangement covered by an FCC approved
or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver.
6.0 Intercarrier Compensation
6.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:
6.1.1 For all traffic originated on a Party’s network including, without limitation, Switched Access Traffic, such
Party shall provide CPN as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1600(c) and in accordance with Section 6.1.3 below.
CPN shall, at a minimum, include information in an industry recognized standard format, consistent with the
requirements of the NANP containing an NPA and seven digit (NXX-XXXX) telephone number. Each Party
to this Agreement will be responsible for passing on any CPN it receives from a Third Party for traffic
delivered to the other Party. In addition, each Party agrees that it shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete,
change, or incorrectly assign any CPN. If either Party identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of
local Exchange Services (including, but not limited to PRI, ISDN and/or Smart Trunks), or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, the Parties agree to cooperate
with one another to investigate and take corrective action.
6.1.2 If one Party is passing CPN but the other Party is not properly receiving information, the Parties will work
cooperatively to correct the problem.
6.1.3 For traffic which is originated by one Party to be terminated on the other Party’s network in AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE, if the percentage of such calls passed with CPN is greater than ninety percent (90%), all calls
delivered by one Party to the other for termination without CPN will be billed as either Section 251(b)(5)
Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic or IntraLATA Toll Traffic in direct proportion to the total MOUs (MOUs) of
calls delivered by one Party to the other with CPN. If the percentage of calls passed with CPN is less than
ninety percent (90%), all calls delivered by one Party to the other without CPN will be billed at Intrastate
Switched Access rates.
6.1.4 For those CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE call usage based charges where actual charge
information is not determinable by AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate
vs. local) or origin of the CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE traffic is unidentifiable, the Parties will
jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate charges to be billed
to the CLEC in accordance with Section 6.13.2 or a default factor of fifty percent (50%) will be applied.
6.1.5 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, each Party will report to the other Percent Interstate Usage
(PIU), Percent Local Usage (PLU) and Percent Local Facility (PLF) factors in order to determine the
appropriate charges to be billed to the originating Party in accordance with Section 6.13.3 below.
6.1.6 CLEC has the sole obligation to enter into compensation arrangements with all Third Parties with whom
CLEC exchanges traffic including without limitation anywhere CLEC originates traffic to or terminates traffic

from an End User being served by a Third Party who has purchased a local switching product from AT&T-
21STATE on a wholesale basis (non-resale) which is used by such Telecommunications carrier to provide
wireline local telephone Exchange Service (dial tone) to its End Users. In no event will AT&T-21STATE
have any liability to CLEC or any Third Party if CLEC fails to enter into such compensation arrangements.
In the event that traffic is exchanged with a Third Party with whom CLEC does not have a traffic
compensation agreement, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-21STATE against any and
all losses including without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party. The Third Party and CLEC will bill
their respective charges directly to each other. AT&T-21STATE will not be required to function as a billing
intermediary, (e.g., clearinghouse). AT&T-21STATE may provide information regarding such traffic to Third
Party carriers or entities as appropriate to resolve traffic compensation issues.
6.1.7 Notwithstanding the classification of traffic under this Attachment, either Party is free to define its own “local”
calling area(s) for purposes of its provision of Telecommunications services to its End Users.
6.1.8 For Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, IntraLATA Toll Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-
PSTN Traffic and Wholesale Local Switching Traffic in AT&T-12STATE, the Party whose End User
originates such traffic shall compensate the Party who terminates such traffic to its End User for the
transport and termination of such traffic at the applicable rate(s) provided in this Attachment and the Pricing
Schedule and/or the applicable switched access tariffs.
6.1.9 To the extent that the Parties are not currently exchanging traffic in a given LATA or local calling area, the
Parties’ obligation to pay intercarrier compensation to each other shall commence on the date the Parties
agree that the Interconnection is complete (i.e., each Party has established its originating trunks as well as
all ancillary traffic trunking such as Operator Services, 911 or Mass Calling trunks) and is capable of fully
supporting originating and terminating End User traffic. In addition, the Parties agree that test traffic is not
subject to compensation pursuant to this Attachment.
6.1.10 The Parties acknowledge that Section 6.0 above addresses the method of compensation for traffic properly
exchanged by the Parties under this Agreement.
6.2 Reciprocal Compensation for Termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP Bound
Traffic:
6.2.1 For purposes of this Agreement, Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic shall mean
Telecommunications traffic exchanged over the Parties’ own facilities in which the originating End User of
one Party and the terminating End User of the other Party are both physically located in the same ILEC
Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable
state Commission or regulatory agency; or both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange
Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This includes but is not limited to,
mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service (ELCS), or other types
of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
6.2.2 For purposes of this Agreement, in accordance with the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order, In
the Matter of Implementation of the Local Compensation Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel. April, 27,
2001) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”), “ISP-Bound Traffic” shall mean Telecommunications traffic
exchanged between CLEC and AT&T-21STATE over each Party’s own facilities in which the originating
End User of one Party and the ISP served by the other Party are:
6.2.2.1 both physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC’s Local (or
“General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state commission or regulatory agency; or
6.2.2.2 both physically located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same
common mandatory local calling area. This includes, but it is not limited to, mandatory EAS,
mandatory ELCS or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
6.2.3 AT&T-21STATE made an offer (the “Offer”) to all Telecommunications carriers to exchange Section
251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic pursuant to the terms and conditions of

the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan of the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and
Order, In the Matter of Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act
of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel.
April 27, 2001)) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”) which was remanded but not vacated in WorldCom, Inc.
v. FCC, No. 01-1218 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
6.2.4 In AT&T-21STATE, the Parties agree to compensate each other for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-
PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic at the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation rate as set forth in
the Pricing Sheets until June 30, 2017.
6.2.5 Beginning July 1, 2017, pursuant to the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
issued by the FCC in the Matter of Developing an Unified Intercarrier Compensation Regime, FCC 11-161
and FCC 11-189 in CC Docket No. 01-92 (rel. November 18, 2011 and December 23, 2011) the Parties will
implement bill and keep in lieu of reciprocal compensation rates for the termination of Section 251(b)(5)
Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP Bound Traffic as set forth in the Pricing Sheets.
6.2.6 CLEC shall only be paid End Office Switching rate element(s).
6.2.7 For purposes of this Section 6.2.10, all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, all Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic, all ISP-
Bound Traffic and all Wholesale Local Switching Traffic shall be referred to as “Billable Traffic” and will be
billed in accordance with Section 6.13 below.
6.2.7.1 Each Party will invoice the other Party on a monthly basis for combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic,
Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between the Parties at the rate set
forth in the Pricing Schedules.
6.3 Intercarrier Compensation for Wholesale Local Switching Traffic for AT&T-12STATE
6.3.1 Where CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE pursuant to the terms of a Section 271
Agreement (herein after referred to as “switching on a wholesale basis”), CLEC will deal directly with Third
Party carriers for purposes of reciprocal compensation for calls originated by or terminated to the End Users
served by such arrangements. AT&T-12STATE is required to provide CLEC with timely, complete and
correct information to enable CLEC to meet the requirements of this Section.
6.3.2 The following reciprocal compensation terms shall apply to all traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE
and CLEC when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE on a wholesale basis:
6.3.2.1 For intra-switch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE and
CLEC, the Parties agree to impose no call termination charges pertaining to reciprocal
compensation on each other.
6.3.2.2 For interswitch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE and
CLEC where CLEC’s End User originates a call that is terminated to an AT&T-12STATE End
User, such traffic shall be paid for reciprocally at the rate applicable for 251(b)(5) and ISP-Bound
Traffic, set forth in the Pricing Schedules.
6.4 Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) Interconnection (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE):
6.4.1 Compensation for MTA shall be at the applicable Tandem Switching and transport charges specified in
Pricing Schedule and shall be billed in addition to any call transport and termination charges.
6.4.2 To the extent CLEC routes its traffic in such a way that utilizes AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s
MTA service without properly ordering MTA, CLEC shall pay AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE the
associated MTA charges.
6.5 Other Telecommunications Traffic:
6.5.1 Except as set forth in Section 6.2 above, the terms of this Attachment are not applicable to (i) interstate or
intrastate Exchange Access traffic, (ii) Information Access traffic, or (iii) any other type of traffic found to be
exempt from reciprocal compensation by the FCC or the Commission, with the exception of ISP-Bound

Contract Id: 4352361

Traffic which is addressed in this Attachment. All Exchange Access traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall
continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable federal and state tariffs.
6.5.2 FX services are retail service offerings purchased by FX End Users which allow such FX End Users to
obtain exchange service from a mandatory local calling area other than the mandatory local calling area
where the FX customer is physically located, but within the same LATA as the number that is assigned. FX
service enables particular End Users to avoid what might otherwise be toll calls between the FX End User’s
physical location and End Users in the foreign exchange. FX Telephone Numbers are those telephone
numbers with rating and routing points that are different from those of the geographic area in which the End
User is physically located. FX Telephone Numbers that deliver second dial tone with the ability for the
calling party to enter access codes and an additional recipient telephone number remain classified as FGA
calls and are subject to the originating and terminating carriers’ tariffed Switched Exchange Access rates
(also known as “Meet Point Billed” compensation). There are two types of FX service:
6.5.2.1 “Dedicated FX Traffic” shall mean those calls routed by means of a physical, dedicated circuit
delivering dial tone or otherwise serving an End User’s station from a serving Central Office (also
known as End Office) located outside of that station’s mandatory local calling area. Dedicated
FX Service permits the End User physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone
numbers resident in the serving Central (or End) Office in another “foreign” exchange, thereby
creating a local presence in that “foreign” exchange.
6.5.2.2 “Virtual Foreign Exchange (FX) Traffic” and “FX-type Traffic” shall refer to those calls delivered to
telephone numbers that are rated as local to the other telephone numbers in a given mandatory
local calling area, but where the recipient End User’s station assigned that telephone number is
physically located outside of that mandatory local calling area. Virtual FX Service also permits an
End User physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone numbers resident in the
serving Central (or End) Office in another “foreign” exchange, thereby creating a local presence
in the “foreign” exchange. Virtual FX Service differs from Dedicated FX Service, however, in that
Virtual FX End Users continue to draw dial tone or are otherwise served from a Central (or End)
Office which may provide service across more than one Commission-prescribed mandatory local
calling area, whereas Dedicated FX Service End Users draw dial tone or are otherwise served
from a Central (or End) Office located outside their mandatory calling area.
6.5.2.3 FX Traffic is not Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and instead the transport and termination compensation
for FX Traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement in AT&T-21STATE.
6.5.2.3.1 To the extent that ISP-Bound Traffic is provisioned via an FX-type arrangement,
such traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement. “Bill and Keep” refers to an
arrangement in which neither of two interconnecting parties charges the other for
terminating FX traffic that originates on the other party’s network.
6.5.2.4 Segregating and Tracking FX Traffic:
6.5.2.4.1 For AT&T-21STATE, the terminating carrier is responsible for separately identifying
IntraLATA Virtual FX, Dedicated FX and FX-type traffic from other types of
Intercarrier traffic for compensation purposes. The terminating carrier will be
responsible for providing the originating carrier with an FX usage summary which
includes a ten (10) digit telephone number level detail of the MOUs terminated to FX
Telephone Numbers on its network each month (or in each applicable billing period,
if not billed monthly), or by any means mutually agreed by the Parties.
6.5.2.4.2 Terminating carrier will not assess compensation charges to the Voice FX MOU and
ISP FX MOU in AT&T-21STATE.
6.5.2.4.3 In AT&T-21STATE either Party may request an audit of the FX Usage Summary or
the FX Factor on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Day’s written Notice and any
audit shall be accomplished during normal business hours at the office of the Party
being audited. Such audit must be performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-21STATE

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
for by the Party requesting the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the
Parties shall use one of the following independent auditors:
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
(Big-4 Auditors). Selection of the Big-4 Auditor shall be made by the Party
requesting the audit and the selected Big-4 Auditor must be independent as
determined by current accounting and auditing standards promulgated by the
appropriate accounting governing body. Such audits shall be requested within six
(6) months of having received the FX Usage Summary or the FX Factor and
associated usage from the other Party and may not be requested more than twice
per year, once per calendar year, unless the audit finds there has been a five
percent (5%) or higher net error or variance in calculations, in which case a
subsequent audit is required. Based upon the audit, previous compensation, billing
and/or settlements will be adjusted for the past six (6) months.
6.5.2.4.3.1 If the FX factor is adjusted based upon the audit results, the adjusted
FX factor will apply for the six (6) month period following the
completion of the audit. If, as a result of the audit, either Party has
overstated the FX factor or underreported the FX Usage by five
percent (5%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for
the cost of the audit and will pay for the cost of a subsequent audit
which is to happen within nine (9) months of the initial audit.
6.5.3 Private Line Services include private line-like and special access services and are not subject to intercarrier
compensation. Private Line Services are defined as a point-to-point connection that provides a dedicated
circuit of pre-subscribed bandwidth between two (2) or more points.
6.5.4 The Parties recognize and agree that ISP and Internet traffic (excluding ISP-Bound Traffic as defined in
Section 6.2 above) could also be exchanged outside of the applicable local calling scope, or routed in ways
that could make the rates and rate structure in Section 6.2 above not apply, including but not limited to ISP
calls that meet the definitions of:
6.5.4.1 FX Traffic
6.5.4.2 Optional EAS Traffic
6.5.4.3 IntraLATA Toll Traffic
6.5.4.4 800, 888, 877, (“8YY”) Traffic
6.5.4.5 FGA Traffic
6.5.4.6 MCA Traffic
6.5.5 The Parties agree that, for the purposes of this Attachment, either Party’s End Users remain free to place
ISP calls under any of the above classifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the
extent such ISP calls are placed, the Parties agree that the compensation mechanisms set forth in Section
6.2 above do not apply. The applicable rates, terms and conditions for: (a) FX Traffic are set forth in
Section 6.5.2 above; (b), Optional EAS Traffic are set forth in Section 6.6 below; (c) 8YY Traffic are set forth
in Section 6.9 below; (d) FGA Traffic are set forth in Section 6.5.2 above; (e) IntraLATA Toll Traffic are set
forth in Section 6.12 below; and/or (f) MCA Traffic are set forth in Section 6.7 below.
6.6 Optional Calling Area Traffic - AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS:
6.6.1 Compensation for Optional Calling Area (OCA) Traffic, (also known as Optional Extended Area Service and
Optional EAS) is for the termination of intercompany traffic to and from the Commission approved one-way
or two-way optional exchanges(s) and the associated metropolitan area except mandatory extended traffic
as addressed in Section 6.2 above. The transport and termination rate applies when AT&T ARKANSAS,
AT&T KANSAS or AT&T TEXAS transports traffic and terminates it at its own switch.

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-21STATE
Page 25 of 36
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
6.6.2 In the context of this Attachment, Optional Calling Areas (OCAs) exist only in the states of Arkansas,
Kansas and Texas and are outlined in the applicable state Local Exchange tariffs. This rate is independent
of any retail service arrangement established by either Party. CLEC and AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS are not precluded from establishing their own local calling areas or prices for
purposes of retail telephone service; however the terminating rates to be used for any such offering will still
be administered as described in this Attachment.
6.6.3 The state specific OCA Transport and Termination rates are identified in the Pricing Schedule.
6.7 MCA Traffic - AT&T MISSOURI:
6.7.1 For compensation purposes in the state of Missouri, Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic shall be
further defined as MCA Traffic and Non-MCA Traffic. MCA Traffic is traffic originated by a party providing a
local calling scope plan pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Orders in Case No. TO-92-306
and Case No. TO-99-483 (MCA Orders) and the call is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic based on the calling scope
of the originating party pursuant to the MCA Orders. Non-MCA Traffic is all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and
ISP-Bound Traffic that is not defined as MCA Traffic.
6.7.1.1 Either party providing Metropolitan Calling Area (MCA) service shall offer the full calling scope
prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306, without regard to the identity of the called Party’s local
service provider. The Parties may offer additional toll-free outbound calling or other services in
conjunction with MCA service, but in any such offering the Party shall not identify any calling
scope other than that prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306 as “MCA” service.
6.7.1.2 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, MCA Traffic
shall be exchanged on a Bill and Keep intercompany compensation basis meaning that the Party
originating a call defined as MCA Traffic shall not compensate the terminating Party for
terminating the call.
6.7.2 The Parties agree to use the LERG to provision the appropriate MCA NXXs in their networks. The LERG
should be updated at least forty-five (45) calendar days in advance of opening a new code to allow the other
Party the ability to make the necessary network modifications. If the Commission orders the Parties to use
an alternative other than the LERG, the Parties will comply with the Commission’s final order.
6.7.3 If CLEC provides service via Resale or in conjunction with ported numbers in the MCA, the appropriate MCA
NXXs will be updated by AT&T MISSOURI.
6.8 Primary Toll Carrier Arrangements:
6.8.1 A Primary Toll Carrier (PTC) is a company that provides IntraLATA Toll Traffic Service for its own End User
customers and potentially for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers. In this ILEC arrangement, the PTC
would receive the ILEC End User IntraLATA toll traffic revenues and pay the ILEC for originating these toll
calls. The PTC would also pay the terminating switched access charges on behalf of the ILEC. In AT&T
GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE wherein Primary Toll Carrier arrangements are mandated and AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T
KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE
is functioning as the PTC for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, the following provisions apply to the
IntraLATA toll traffic which is subject to the PTC arrangement:
6.8.1.1 AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated
from that Third Party ILEC and terminated to CLEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state
Commission. Where AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA is functioning as the PTC for
Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA shall pay
CLEC on behalf of the originating Third Party ILEC for the termination of such IntraLATA toll
traffic at the terminating switched access rates as set forth in CLEC’s intrastate access service
tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in the AT&T-
21STATE intrastate access service tariff in the respective state.

6.8.1.2 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE
shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from that Third Party ILEC and terminated
to CLEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC
arrangement mandated by the respective state Commission. Where AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T
KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE is functioning as the PTC
for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, the following provisions apply to the minutes of use
terminating to CLEC. AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE and CLEC will work cooperatively to develop a percentage of the amount of
state specific PTC ILEC originated intraLATA toll minutes of use that are within the state specific
total ILEC originated minutes of use reflected in the monthly EMI 11-01-01 Records provided to
CLEC by AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T
TENNESSEE. CLEC will apply this state specific percentage against the state specific total ILEC
originated EMI 11-01-01 minutes of use each month to determine the amount of PTC intraLATA
toll minutes of use for which AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA
and/or AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC. Such percentage will be updated no more
than twice each year. AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC for this PTC traffic as it would for AT&T-21STATE
originated traffic as set forth in CLEC’s Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-21STATE.
6.8.1.3 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH
CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated
from CLEC and terminated to the Third Party ILEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state
Commission. CLEC shall pay AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T
OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE for the use of its facilities
at the rates set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s intrastate access service tariff in the respective state.
CLEC shall pay the ILEC directly for the termination of such traffic originated from CLEC.
6.9 IntraLATA 800 Traffic:
6.9.1 The Parties shall provide to each other IntraLATA 800 Access Detail Usage Data for Customer billing and
IntraLATA 800 Copy Detail Usage Data for access billing in Exchange Message Interface (EMI) format. On
a monthly basis, at a minimum, the Parties agree to provide this data to each other at no charge. In the
event of errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in data received from either Party, the liability of the Party
providing such data shall be limited to the provision of corrected data only. If the originating Party does not
send an End User billable Record to the terminating Party, the originating Party will not bill the terminating
Party any interconnection charges for this traffic.
6.9.2 IntraLATA 800 Traffic calls are billed to and paid for by the called or terminating Party, regardless of which
Party performs the 800 query. For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, each Party shall pay the other
the appropriate switched access charges set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate
or interstate switched access tariffs. CLEC will pay AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE the database
query charge as set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access
services Tariff as filed and in effect with the FCC or appropriate Commission as applicable. Where
technically feasible, each Party will provide to the other Party the appropriate Records, in accordance with
industry standards, necessary for billing intraLATA 8YY customers. The Records provided will be in a
standard EMI format. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE provision of 8YY Toll Free Dialing (TFD) to
CLEC requires interconnection from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s 8YY Signal
Channel Point (SCP). Such interconnections shall be established pursuant to AT&T-21STATE’s Common
Channel Signaling Interconnection Guidelines and Telcordia’s CCS Network Interface Specification
document, TR-TSV-000905. CLEC shall establish SS7 interconnection at the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE Local Signal Transfer Points serving the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE 8YY
SCPs that CLEC desires to query. The terms and conditions for 8YY TFD are set out in AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff.

6.10 Meet-Point Billing (MPB) and IXC Switched Access Traffic Compensation:
6.10.1 Intercarrier compensation for Switched Access Traffic shall be on a MPB basis as described below.
6.10.2 The Parties will establish MPB arrangements in order to jointly provide Switched Access Services via the
respective carrier’s Tandem Office Switch in accordance with the MPB guidelines contained in the OBF’s
Multiple Exchange Carriers Ordering and Design (MECOD) and Multiple Exchange Carrier Access Billing
(MECAB) documents, as amended from time to time.
6.10.3 Billing for the Switched Exchange Access Services jointly provided by the Parties via MPB arrangements
shall be according to the Multiple Bill/Single Tariff method. As described in the MECAB document, each
Party will render a bill in accordance with its own tariff for that portion of the service it provides. Each Party
will bill its own network access service rates. The Residual Interconnection Charge (RIC), if any, will be
billed by the Party providing the End Office function.
6.10.4 The Parties will maintain provisions in their respective federal and state access tariffs, or provisions within
the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any successor tariff, sufficient to reflect
this MPB arrangement, including MPB percentages.
6.10.5 As detailed in the MECAB document, the Parties will exchange all information necessary to accurately,
reliably and promptly bill third parties for Switched Access Services traffic jointly handled by the Parties via
the MPB arrangement, when the Parties do not have all detailed Recordings for billing.
6.10.5.1 The Parties agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will bill IXCs for originating and
terminating access charges from AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Recordings when
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has direct connections with IXCs via AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s access tandem. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will
pass EMI Records to CLEC when AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is the Official
Recording Company. The Parties also agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and
CLEC will exchange EMI records when each are acting as the Official Recording Company and
the CLEC is the access tandem company with direct connections with IXCs.
6.10.5.2 The Parties also agree that AT&T-12STATE and CLEC will exchange EMI Records when each is
acting as the Official Recording Company. As described in the MECAB document, the Official
Recording Company for Tandem routed traffic is: (1) the End Office company for originating
traffic, (2) the Tandem company for terminating traffic and (3) the SSP company for originating
800 traffic.
6.10.6 Information shall be passed or exchanged in a mutually acceptable electronic file transfer protocol. Where
the EMI Records cannot be transferred due to a transmission failure, Records can be provided via a
mutually acceptable medium. The provision of Access Usage Records (AURs) to accommodate MPB will
be on a reciprocal, no charge basis. Each Party agrees to provide the other Party with AURs based upon
mutually agreed upon intervals.
6.10.7 MPB shall also apply to all jointly provided Switched Access MOU traffic bearing the 900, or toll free NPAs
(e.g., 800, 877, 866, 888 NPAs, or any other non-geographic NPAs).
6.10.7.1 For AT&T-12STATE, the Party that performs the SSP function (launches the query to the 800
database) will bill the 800 Service Provider for this function.
6.10.7.2 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, CLEC will pay the database query charge set forth
in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access services Tariff.
6.10.8 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC agree to provide the other Party with notification of any discovered errors in the
record exchange process within ten (10) Business Days of the discovery.
6.10.9 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60)

6.11 Compensation for Origination and Termination of InterLATA Traffic:
6.11.1 Where a CLEC originates or terminates its own End User InterLATA Traffic not subject to MPB, the CLEC
must purchase feature group access service from AT&T-21STATE’s state or federal access tariffs,
whichever is applicable, to carry such InterLATA Traffic.
6.12 IntraLATA Toll Traffic Compensation:
6.12.1 For intrastate IntraLATA Message Telephone Service (MTS) toll traffic, compensation for termination of
such traffic will be at terminating access rates. For intrastate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for
termination of such traffic will be at originating access rates, including the Carrier Common Line (CCL)
charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set forth in each Party’s intrastate access
service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in AT&T-21STATE’s
tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.12.2 For interstate IntraLATA MTS toll traffic, compensation for termination of such traffic will be at terminating
access rates. For interstate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for termination of such traffic will be
originating access rates, including the CCL charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set
forth in each Party’s interstate access service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the
compensation contained in the AT&T-21STATE’s tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.13 Billing Arrangements for Termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic,
Optional EAS Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic:
6.13.1 In AT&T-21STATE, each Party, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, will calculate terminating
Interconnection MOUs based on standard switch Recordings made within terminating carrier’s network for
Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, IntraLATA Toll Traffic and in AT&T-
12STATE, Wholesale Local Switching Traffic. These Recordings are the basis for each Party to generate
bills to the other Party.
6.13.1.1 Where CLEC is using terminating Recordings to bill intercarrier compensation, AT&T-12STATE
will provide the terminating Records where available by means of the Daily Usage File (DUF) to
identify traffic that originates from an End User being served by a Third Party telecommunications
carrier using an AT&T-12STATE non-resale offering whereby AT&T-12STATE provides the End
Office switching on a wholesale basis. Such Records will contain the Operating Company
Number (OCN) of the responsible LEC that originated the calls which CLEC may use to bill such
originating carrier for MOUs terminated on CLEC’s network.
6.13.2 For those usage based charges where actual charge information is not determinable by AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the traffic is unidentifiable,
the Parties will jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate
charges. PLU is calculated by dividing the sum of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic
MOU and ISP-Bound Traffic MOU delivered to a Party for termination by the total MOU delivered to a Party
for termination.
6.13.2.1 CLEC and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE agree to exchange such reports and/or data as
provided in this Attachment to facilitate the proper billing of traffic. Either Party may request an
audit of such usage reports on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Days written Notice and any
audit shall be accomplished during normal business hours at the office of the Party being audited.
Such audit must be performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid for by the Party requesting
the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be reached within one (1) month of the date of the written
request for an audit, the Parties shall use one (1) of the following independent auditors:
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Big-4 Auditors).
Selection of the Big-4 Auditor shall be made by the Party requesting the audit and the selected
Big-4 Auditor must be independent as determined by current accounting and auditing standards
promulgated by the appropriate accounting governing body. Such audit shall be requested within
six (6) months of having received the usage reports from the other Party and may not be
requested more than twice per year, once per calendar year for each call detail type unless the

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
audit finds there has been a five percent (5%) or higher net error or variance in calculations.
Based upon the audit, previous compensation, billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for the
past six (6) months. If, as a result of the audit, either Party has overstated the PLU or
underreported the call detail usage by five percent (5%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the
auditing Party for the cost of the audit.
6.13.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Jurisdictional Reporting Process:
6.13.3.1 Each Party shall report to the other the projected PIU factors, including but not limited to PIU
associated with facilities (PIUE) and Terminating PIU (TPIU) factors. The application of the PIU
will determine the respective interstate traffic percentages to be billed at AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE’s FCC No. 1 Tariff rates. All jurisdictional report requirements, rules and
regulations for IXCs specified in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s interstate and/or
intrastate access services tariff(s) will apply to CLEC. After interstate and intrastate traffic
percentages have been determined by use of PIU procedures, the PLU and PLF factors will be
used for application and billing of local traffic and facilities. The intrastate toll traffic shall be billed
at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff rates. Each Party
shall update its PIUs on the first of January, April, July and October of each year and shall send it
to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such
month to be effective the first bill period the following month, respectively, for all services showing
the percentages of use for the past three (3) months ending the last day of December, March,
June and September. Additional requirements associated with PIU calculations and reporting
shall be as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting
Guide.
6.13.3.2 Each Party shall report to the other a PLU factor. The application of the PLU will determine the
amount of local or ISP-Bound minutes to be billed to the other Party. Each Party shall update its
PLU on the first of January, April, July and October of each year and shall send it to the other
Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such month to be
effective the first bill period the following month, respectively, based on local and ISP-Bound
usage for the past three (3) months ending the last day of December, March, June and
September, respectively. Requirements associated with PLU calculation and reporting shall be
as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.13.3.3 Each Party shall report to the other a PLF factor. The application of the PLF will determine the
portion of switched dedicated transport to be billed per the local jurisdiction rates. The PLF shall
be applied to multiplexing, local channel and interoffice channel switched dedicated transport
utilized in the provision of Local Interconnection Trunks. Each Party shall update its PLF on the
first of January, April, July and October of the year and shall send it to the other Party to be
received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such month to be effective
the first bill period the following month, respectively. Requirements associated with PLF
calculation and reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s
Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.13.3.4 Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 6.13.3.1 above, Section 6.13.3.2 above and Section
6.13.3.3 above where AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has message Recording
technology that identifies the jurisdiction of traffic terminated to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE, such information shall, at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s option, be utilized to
determine the appropriate jurisdictional reporting factors (i.e., PLU, PIU and/or PLF), in lieu of
those provided by CLEC. In the event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE opts to utilize
its own data to determine jurisdictional reporting factors, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE
shall notify CLEC at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter
in which AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will begin to utilize its own data.
6.13.3.5 On thirty (30) calendar days written Notice, CLEC must provide AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE the ability and opportunity to conduct an annual audit to ensure the proper billing of

Contract Id: 4352361

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
traffic. CLEC shall retain Records of call detail for a minimum of nine (9) months from which the
PLU, PLF and/or PIU can be ascertained. The audit shall be conducted during normal business
hours at an office designated by CLEC. Audit requests shall not be submitted more frequently
than one (1) time per calendar year. Audits shall be performed by an independent auditor
chosen by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. The audited factor (PLF, PLU and/or PIU)
shall be adjusted based upon the audit results and shall apply to the usage for the audited period
through the time period when the audit is completed, to the usage for the quarter prior to the audit
period and to the usage for the two (2) quarters following the completion of the audit. If, as a
result of an audit, CLEC is found to have overstated the PLF, PLU and/or PIU by five percentage
points (5%) or more, CLEC shall reimburse AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE for the cost
of the audit.
6.13.4 In states in which AT&T-21STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic
pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the FCC ISP Compensation
Order, ISP-Bound Traffic will be calculated using the 3:1 Presumption as set forth in Section 6.2.10 above of
this Attachment.
6.13.5 The measurement of MOUs over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be in actual conversation
seconds. The total conversation seconds over each individual Local Interconnection Trunk Group will be
totaled for the entire monthly bill and then rounded to the next whole minute.
6.13.6 All ISP-Bound Traffic for a given usage month shall be due and owing at the same time as payments for
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic under this Attachment. The Parties agree that all
terms and conditions regarding disputed MOUs, nonpayment, partial payment, late payment, interest on
outstanding balances, or other billing and payment terms shall apply to ISP-Bound Traffic the same as for
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic under this Attachment.
6.13.7 For billing disputes arising from Intercarrier Compensation charges, the Party challenging the disputed
amounts (the “Non-Paying Party”) may withhold payment for the amounts in dispute (the “Disputed
Amounts”) from the Party rendering the bill (the “Billing Party”) only for so long as the dispute remains
pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and Conditions. Late payment
charges and interest will continue to accrue on the Disputed Amounts while the dispute remains pending.
The Non-Paying Party need not pay late payment charges or interest on the Disputed Amounts for so long
as the dispute remains pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and
Conditions. Upon resolution of the dispute pertaining to the Disputed Amounts in accordance with the
dispute resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions: (1) the Non-Paying Party will remit the
appropriate Disputed Amounts to the Billing Party, together with all related interest and late payment
charges, to the Billing Party within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute, if (and to the
extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party; and/or (2) the Billing Party will render all
appropriate credits and adjustments to the Non-Paying Party for the Disputed Amounts, together with all
appropriate interest and late payment charges, within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute,
if (and to the extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Non-Paying Party.
6.13.8 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60)
calendar days of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable estimate of
the lost data, based upon no less than three (3) and no more than twelve (12) consecutive months of prior
usage data.
6.14 Switched Access Traffic:
6.14.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates from an
End User physically located in one (1) local exchange and delivered for termination to an End User
physically located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing a common
mandatory local calling area as defined in AT&T-21STATE’s local exchange tariffs on file with the
applicable state commission) including, without limitation, any traffic that terminates over a Party’s circuit
switch, including traffic from a service that (i) originates over a circuit switch and uses Internet Protocol (IP)
transport technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP transport or multiple providers are

involved in providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the End User’s premises in IP format and is
transmitted to the switch of a provider of voice communication applications or services when such switch
utilizes IP technology. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access
Traffic shall be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating
Party’s access tariff(s) and shall be subject to applicable intrastate and interstate switched access charges
not to exceed AT&T’s access tariff rates; provided, however, the following categories of Switched Access
Traffic are not subject to the above stated requirement relating to routing over feature group access trunks:
6.14.1.1 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC End User that obtains local dial tone
from CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the IntraLATA toll
provider;
6.14.1.2 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an AT&T-21STATE End User that obtains
local dial tone from AT&T-21STATE where AT&T-21STATE is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic/
provider and the IntraLATA toll provider;
6.14.1.3 Switched Access Traffic delivered to AT&T-21STATE from an IXC where the terminating number
is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the LNP query; and/or
6.14.1.4 Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a Third Party CLEC over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups destined to the other Party.
6.15 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies and arguments
relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the Parties prior to the Effective Date
of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the Petition for Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-
to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from Access Charges, WC Docket No. 01-361 (Released April 21, 2004).
6.15.1 In the limited circumstances in which a Third Party CLEC delivers Switched Access Traffic as described in
Section 6.15.1.4 above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, such Party may deliver
such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If it is
determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups and unless the
traffic was delivered over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups pursuant to an agreement filed with, and
approved by, the Commission, the terminating Party may object to the delivery of such traffic by providing
written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to the Notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions and request removal of such traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with
the goal of removing such traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has
not removed or is unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 6.15.1.4 above
from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of Notice from the
other Party, the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the applicable
Commission to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such interconnection trunks up to
and including the right to block such traffic and to obtain compensation, if appropriate, from the Third Party
CLEC delivering such traffic to the extent it is not blocked.

ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T
MISSOURI, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS (“AT&T-
TSP”) acts as a transit service provider for CLEC. Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications
Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic that does not originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End
Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to exchange CLEC originated traffic with a Third Party
Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly interconnected, and it allows CLEC to receive traffic
originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier.
8.1.2 AT&T-TSP offers Transit Traffic Services to interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange
Local Exchange Carriers.
8.2 Definitions
The definitions in this Section 8 are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Section 8. If a
definition herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or this
Attachment 02, then the definition herein governs for the purpose of this Section 8. To the extent that defined terms
in the Agreement are used in this Section, but for which no definition appears herein, then the definition in the
Agreement controls.
8.2.1 “AT&T - Transit Service Provider” or (“AT&T-TSP”) means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO,
AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit
Traffic Services to CLEC and Third Parties.
8.2.2 “Calling Party Number” or “CPN” is as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1600(c).
8.2.3 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or
“General”) Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically
located within neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local
calling area. This includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory
Extended Local Calling Service (ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
8.2.4 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
8.2.5 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that
transits AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
8.2.6 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when
CLEC originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network, i.e., CLEC is using AT&T-TSP’s Transit
Traffic Service.
8.2.7 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP
and delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s
network. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a

Page 34 of 36
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Attachment.
Additionally Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
8.2.8 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by
AT&T-TSP.
8.2.9 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP
for Transit Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is
directly interconnected with an AT&T-TSP Tandem.
8.3 Responsibilities of the Parties
8.3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which
AT&T-TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA, to the extent a LATA boundary
waiver exists.
8.3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic
Service rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.
8.4 CLEC Originated Traffic
8.4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating
Carriers for Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated
Transit Traffic. AT&T-TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and
Third Party Terminating Carriers, nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party
Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
8.4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not
have a traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP
against any and all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating
Carrier against AT&T-TSP for such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined
for a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement,
and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the
Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify
AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or court order, including, but not limited
to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic Termination charges, and any billing
and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing charges, interest or costs from
CLEC.
8.4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls
delivered to AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly
assign or re-assign any CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local
exchange services, or identifies stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly
assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is
sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper CPN information, then CLEC will work
cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from CLEC, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include CPN with
Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
8.4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing
appropriate information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
8.5 CLEC Terminated Traffic
8.5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service as the Transit Service
Provider for calls terminated to CLEC.
8.5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from
the Third Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party

Originating Carrier, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this
situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or
incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP
and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take corrective action. If the Third Party
Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly receiving the information, then
CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to correct the problem.
8.5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating
Carrier. AT&T-TSP, as the Transit Service Provider, is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic,
and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed as the default originator of such Transit Traffic or be considered as the
default originator.
8.6 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
8.6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third
Parties through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in this
Attachment 02. In the event CLEC has no switch in a LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within such LATA and trunk from each POI to
AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in this Attachment 02.
8.6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem Office Switch from which the Third Party
Terminating Carrier switch subtends.
8.6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted.
Transit Traffic routed by CLEC through any AT&T-TSP End Office Switch shall be considered misrouted.
Upon written notification from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting
within sixty (60) days.
8.6.4 AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T
OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS only.
8.6.4.1 The same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.) used pursuant to CLEC’s
Agreement and in this Attachment 02 to route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-
TSP to route Transit Traffic.
8.6.5 AT&T KENTUCKY and /or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA only
8.6.5.1 The same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.) used pursuant to CLEC’s
Agreement for Transit Trunk Groups and in this Attachment 02 for Third Party Trunk Groups will
be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
8.7 Direct Trunking Requirements.
8.7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days
written notice from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement
between itself and the Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC
agrees to cease routing Transit Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating
Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment 03 - Structure Access (here-on referred to as “Appendix”) sets forth the terms and conditions for
Right(s) of Way (ROW), Conduits and Poles provided by AT&T-21STATE and CLEC.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Anchor” means a device, structure, or assembly which stabilizes a Pole and holds it in place. An Anchor assembly
may consist of a rod and fixed object or plate, typically embedded in the ground, which is attached to a guy strand or
guy wire, which, in turn, is attached to the Pole. The term Anchor does not include the guy strand which connects the
Anchor to the Pole and includes only those Anchors which are owned by AT&T-21STATE, as distinguished from
Anchors which are owned and controlled by other persons or entities.
2.2 “Anchor/Guy Strand” means supporting wires, typically stranded together, or other devices attached to a Pole and
connecting that Pole to an Anchor or to another Pole for the purpose of increasing Pole stability. The term
Anchor/Guy Strand includes, but is not limited to, strands sometimes referred to as Anchor strands, down guys, guy
strands, and Pole-to-Pole guys.
2.3 “Application” means the process of requesting information related to records, Pole and/or Conduit availability, or
make-ready requirements for AT&T-21STATE-owned or controlled Facilities. Each Application is limited in size to a
maximum of 1) 100 consecutive Poles or 2) 10 consecutive Manhole sections or 5000 feet, whichever is greater. The
Application includes (but is not limited to) request for records, records investigation and/or a field investigation, and
Make-Ready Work.
2.4 “Assigned” when used with respect to Conduit or Duct space or Poles, means any space in such Conduit or Duct or
on such Pole that is occupied by a Telecommunications Service provider or a municipal or other governmental
authority. To ensure the judicious use of Poles and Conduits, space Assigned to a Telecommunications Service
provider must be physically occupied by the service provider, be it AT&T-21STATE or a new entrant, within twelve
(12) months of the space being Assigned.
2.5 “Attaching Party” means any Party wishing to make a physical Facility Attachment on or in any AT&T structure.
2.6 “Attachment” as used herein means the physical connection to AT&T-21STATE‘s ROW and all associated Structure
Access connectivity.
2.7 “Available” when used with respect to Conduit or Duct space or Poles, means any usable space in such Conduit or
Duct or on such Pole not assigned to a specific provider at the applicable time.
2.8 “Conduit” means a structure containing one or more Ducts, usually placed in the ground, in which cables or wires
may be installed.
2.9 “Conduit Occupancy” means the presence of wire, cable, optical conductors, or other Facilities within any portion of
AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System.
2.10 “Conduit System” means any combination of Ducts, Conduits, Manholes, and Handholes joined to form an integrated
whole. In this Appendix, the term refers to Conduit Systems owned or controlled by AT&T-21STATE.
2.11 “Cost” means the charges made by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC for specific work performed, and shall be (a) the actual
charges made by subcontractors to AT&T-21STATE for work and/or, (b) if the work was performed by AT&T-
21STATE employees, it shall be calculated on an individual case basis, based on the estimated amount of work to be
performed.
2.12 “Duct” means a single enclosed tube, pipe, or channel for enclosing and carrying cables, wires, and other Facilities.
As used in this Appendix, the term Duct includes Inner-Ducts created by subdividing a Duct into smaller channels.
2.13 “Facilities” refer to any property or equipment used in the provision of Telecommunications Services.
2.14 “Handholes” means an enclosure, usually below ground level, used for the purpose of installing, operating, and
maintaining facilities in a Conduit. A Handhole is too small to permit personnel to physically enter.

Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
2.15 “Inner-Duct” means a pathway created by subdividing a Duct into smaller channels.
2.16 “Joint User” means a public utility (as a business organization, like an electric company, performing a public service
and subject to special governmental regulation) which has entered into an Agreement with AT&T-21STATE providing
reciprocal rights of attachment of Facilities owned by each Party to the Poles, Ducts, Conduits and ROW owned by
the other Party.
2.17 “Joint Use Pole” means a pole not owned by AT&T-21STATE, but upon which AT&T-21STATE maintains its
Facilities.
2.18 “Lashing” means an Attachment of a Sheath or Inner-Duct to a supporting strand.
2.19 “License” means any License issued pursuant to this Appendix and may, if the context requires, refer to Conduit
Occupancy or Pole Attachment Licenses issued by AT&T-21STATE.
2.20 “Make-Ready Work” means all work performed or to be performed to prepare AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit Systems,
Poles or Anchors and related Facilities for the requested occupancy or attachment of CLEC’s Facilities. Make-Ready
Work includes, but is not limited to, clearing obstructions (e.g., by rodding Ducts to ensure clear passage), the
rearrangement, transfer, replacement, and removal of existing Facilities on a Pole or in a Conduit System where such
work is required solely to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities and not to meet AT&T-21STATE’s business needs or
convenience. Make-Ready Work may require “dig ups” of existing Facilities and may include the repair, enlargement
or modification of AT&T-21STATE’s Facilities (including, but not limited to, Conduits, Ducts, Handholes and
Manholes) or the performance of other work required to make a Pole, Anchor, Conduit or Duct usable for the initial
placement of CLEC’s Facilities.
2.21 “Manhole” means an enclosure, usually below ground level and entered through a hole on the surface covered with a
cast iron or concrete Manhole cover, which personnel may enter and use for the purpose of installing, operating, and
maintaining Facilities in a Conduit.
2.22 “Occupancy” means the physical presence of Telecommunication Facilities in a Duct, on a Pole, or within a ROW.
2.23 “Overlashing” involves an attacher tying communication conductors to existing, supportive strands of cable on poles,
which enables attachers to replace deteriorated cables or expand the capacity of existing facilities while reducing
construction disruption and associated expense.
2.24 “Pole” means both utility Poles and Anchors but only to those utility Poles and Anchors owned or controlled by AT&T-
21STATE, and does not include utility Poles or Anchors with respect to which AT&T-21STATE has no legal authority
to permit attachments by other persons or entities.
2.25 “Pole Attachment Act” and “Pole Attachment Act of 1978” means those provisions of the Act, as amended, now
codified as 47 U.S.C. § 224.
2.26 “Pre-License Survey” means all work and activities performed or to be performed to determine whether there is
adequate capacity on a Pole or in a Conduit or Conduit System (including Manholes and Handholes) to
accommodate CLEC’s Facilities and to determine what Make-Ready Work, if any, is required to prepare the Pole,
Conduit or Conduit System to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities.
2.27 “Right(s) of Way (ROW)” means the right to use the land or other property of another party to place Poles, Conduits,
cables, other structures and equipment, or to provide passage to access such structures and equipment. A ROW
may run under, on, or above public or private property (including air space above public or private property) and may
include the right to use discrete space in buildings, building complexes, or other locations.
2.28 “Sheath” or “Sheathing” means an outer covering containing communications wires, fibers, or other communications
media.
2.29 “Spare Capacity” means any Poles, Conduit, Duct or Inner-Duct not currently assigned or subject to a pending
Application for Attachment/Occupancy. Spare Capacity does not include an Inner-Duct (not to exceed one Inner-
Duct per party) reserved by AT&T-21STATE, CLEC, or a Third Party for maintenance, repair, or emergency
restoration.

3.1 Undertaking of AT&T-21STATE:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC with equal and nondiscriminatory access to Pole space, Conduits,
Ducts, and ROW on terms and conditions equal to those provided by AT&T-21STATE to itself or to any
other Telecommunications Service provider. Further, AT&T-21STATE shall not withhold or delay
assignment of such Facilities to CLEC because of the potential or forecasted needs of itself or Third Parties.
3.2 Attachments and Occupancies Authorized by this Appendix:
3.2.1 AT&T-21STATE shall issue one or more Licenses to CLEC authorizing CLEC to attach Facilities to AT&T-
21STATE’s owned or controlled Poles and to place Facilities within AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled
Conduits, Ducts or ROW under the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix and the Act.
3.2.2 Unless otherwise provided herein, authority to attach Facilities to AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled
Poles, to place Facilities within AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled Conduits, Ducts or ROW shall be
granted only in individual Licenses granted under this Appendix and the placement or use of such Facilities
shall be determined in accordance with such Licenses and procedures established in this Appendix.
3.2.3 CLEC agrees that its attachment of Facilities to AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled Poles, occupancy of
AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled Conduits, Ducts or ROW shall take place pursuant to the licensing
procedures set forth herein, and AT&T-21STATE agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
issuance of such Licenses.
3.2.4 CLEC may not sublease or otherwise authorize any Third Party to use any part of the AT&T-21STATE
Facilities licensed to CLEC under this Appendix, except that CLEC may lease its own Facilities to Third
Parties, or allow Affiliates to over lash cables to CLEC cables. Notwithstanding the above, upon Notice to
AT&T-21STATE, CLEC may permit Third Parties who have an Agreement with AT&T-21STATE to over
lash to existing CLEC attachments in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Third Party’s
Agreement with AT&T-21STATE.
3.2.5 Attaching Party warrants that any overlashing the Attaching Party conducts or permits (via a third party or
contractor) shall meet the following requirements: (1) the overlashing complies with the NESC and any other
industry standards; (2) the Attaching Party has computed the pole loading with the additional overlashed
facility, and the pole will not be overloaded with the addition of the overlashed facility; (3) the Attaching Party
has determined that no make ready is necessary to accommodate the overlashed facility, or will insure that
any make-ready necessary will be conducted before the overlashing occurs. Attaching Party agrees to
indemnify AT&T-21STATE should any of the warranties be breached.
3.3 Licenses:
3.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix, AT&T-21STATE shall issue to CLEC one or
more Licenses per state authorizing CLEC to place or attach Facilities in or to specified Poles, Conduits,
Ducts or ROW owned or controlled by AT&T-21STATE located within the state on a “first-come, first-
served” basis. AT&T-21STATE may deny a License Application if AT&T-21STATE determines that the
Pole, Conduit or Duct space specifically requested by CLEC is necessary to meet AT&T-21STATE’s
present needs, or is Licensed by AT&T-21STATE to another CLEC, or is otherwise unavailable based on
engineering concerns. AT&T-21STATE shall provide written Notice to CLEC within a reasonable time
specifying in detail the reasons for denying CLEC’s request. AT&T-21STATE shall have the right to
designate the particular Duct(s) to be occupied, the location and manner in which CLEC’s Facilities will

Ducts or other parts of AT&T-21STATE’s owned or controlled Conduit Systems are located.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC with access to and use of such ROW to the same extent and for the
same purposes that AT&T-21STATE may access or use such ROW, including but not limited to access for
ingress, egress or other access and to construct, utilize, maintain, modify, and remove Facilities for which
Pole attachment, Conduit Occupancy, or ROW use Licenses have been issued, provided that any
Agreement with a Third Party under which AT&T-21STATE holds such rights expressly or impliedly grants
AT&T-21STATE the right to provide such rights to others.
3.4.3 Where AT&T-21STATE notifies CLEC that AT&T-21STATE’s Agreement with a Third Party does not
expressly or impliedly grant AT&T-21STATE the ability to provide such access and use rights to others,
upon CLEC’s request, AT&T-21STATE will use its best efforts to obtain the owner’s consent and to
otherwise secure such rights for CLEC. CLEC agrees to reimburse AT&T-21STATE for the reasonable and
demonstrable Costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE in obtaining such rights for CLEC.
3.4.4 In cases where a Third Party Agreement does not grant AT&T-21STATE the right to provide access and
use rights to others as contemplated in Section 3.4.2 above and AT&T-21STATE, despite its best efforts, is
unable to secure such access and use rights for CLEC in accordance with Section 3.4.3 above, or, in the
case where CLEC elects not to invoke its rights under Section 3.4.2 above or Section 3.4.3 above, CLEC
shall be responsible for obtaining such permission to access and use such ROW. AT&T-21STATE shall
cooperate with CLEC in obtaining such permission and shall not prevent or delay any Third Party
assignment of ROWs to CLEC.
3.4.5 Where AT&T-21STATE has any ownership or ROW to buildings or building complexes, or within buildings
or building complexes, AT&T-21STATE shall offer to CLEC through a License or other attachment:
3.4.5.1 The right to use any available space owned or controlled by AT&T-21STATE in the building or
building complex to install CLEC equipment and Facilities; and
3.4.5.2 Ingress and egress to such space.
3.4.6 Except to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of the Act, neither this Appendix nor any License
granted hereunder shall constitute a conveyance or assignment of any of either Party’s rights to use any
public or private ROW, and nothing contained in this Appendix or in any License granted hereunder shall be
construed as conferring on one Party any right to interfere with the other Party’s access to any such public
or private ROW.
3.5 No Effect on AT&T-21STATE’s Right to Convey Property:
3.5.1 Nothing contained in this Appendix or in any License issued hereunder shall in any way affect the right of
AT&T-21STATE to convey to any other person or entity any interest in real or personal property, including
any Poles, Conduit or Ducts to or in which CLEC has attached or placed Facilities pursuant to Licenses
issued under this Appendix provided however that AT&T-21STATE shall give CLEC reasonable advance
written Notice of such intent to convey.
3.5.2 Nothing herein contained shall be construed as a grant of any exclusive authorization, right or privilege to
CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall have the right to grant, renew and extend rights and privileges to others not
Parties to this Agreement, by contract or otherwise, to use any Pole, Anchor, or Conduit System covered by
this Appendix and CLEC’s rights hereunder.
3.6 No Effect on AT&T-21STATE’s Rights to Manage its Own Facilities:
3.6.1 This Appendix shall not be construed as limiting or interfering with AT&T-21STATE’s rights set forth below,
except to the extent expressly provided by the provisions of this Appendix or Licenses issued hereunder or
by the Act or other applicable laws, rules or regulations:
3.6.1.1 To locate, relocate, move, replace, modify, maintain, and operate AT&T-21STATE’s own
Facilities within AT&T-21STATE’s Conduits, Ducts or ROW or any of AT&T-21STATE’s

8.0 Application Form and Fees
8.1 Application Process:
8.1.1 To apply for a License under this Appendix, CLEC shall submit the appropriate AT&T-21STATE
administrative form(s),which can be found on the AT&T CLEC On-Line website, (two (2) sets of each and
either a route map specifically indicating CLEC desired route or engineered drawings are to be included).
CLEC has the option of (1) requesting copies of AT&T-21STATE records only, (2) requesting a records
and/or field survey to determine availability, and/or (3) requesting a Make-Ready Work estimate. Any Joint
Use Pole(s) included in such a request shall be included in the records/field survey and Make-Ready Work
estimate. Before the Application and Conduit Occupancy License or Application and Pole Attachment
License form is approved for attachment, Make-Ready Work must be complete or a records or field survey
conducted by AT&T-21STATE has determined that Make-Ready Work is not required. CLEC shall submit
with CLEC’s License Application a proposed or estimated construction schedule as set forth below in
Section 11.0 below.
8.2 AT&T-21STATE will process License Applications in the order in which they are received; provided, however, that
when CLEC has multiple Applications on file with AT&T-21STATE, CLEC may designate its desired priority of
completion of pre-licenses and Make-Ready Work with respect to all such Applications.
8.2.1 Each Application for a License under this Section shall specify the proposed route of CLEC’s Facilities and
identify the Conduits and Ducts or Poles, Joint Use Pole(s) and Pole Facilities along the proposed route in
which CLEC desires to place or attach its Facilities, and describe the physical size, weight and jacket
material of the cable which CLEC desires to place in each Conduit or Duct or the number and type of
cables, apparatus enclosures and other Facilities which CLEC desires to attach to each Pole or Joint Use
Pole.
8.2.2 Each Application for a License under this Section shall be accompanied by a proposed (or estimated)
construction schedule containing the information specified in Section 11.1 below of this Appendix, and an
indication of whether CLEC will, at its option, perform its own Make-Ready Work.
8.3 Multiple Cables, Multiple Services, Lashing or Placing Additional Cables, and Replacement of Facilities:
8.3.1 CLEC may include multiple cables in a single License Application and multiple services (e.g., CATV and non
CATV services) may be provided by CLEC in the same cable Sheath. CLEC’s Lashing additional cable to
existing Facilities and placing additional cables in Conduits or Ducts already occupied by CLEC’s Facilities
shall be permitted, and no additional fees will be applied; provided, however, that if CLEC desires to lash

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
additional cable to existing Facilities of a Third Party, CLEC shall provide AT&T-21STATE with reasonable
Notice, and shall obtain written permission from the owner of the existing Facilities. If AT&T-21STATE
determines that the requested Lashing would violate safety or engineering requirements, AT&T-21STATE
shall provide written Notice to CLEC within a reasonable time specifying in detail AT&T-21STATE’s
findings. If CLEC desires to place additional cables in Conduits or Ducts which are already occupied, or to
replace existing Facilities with new Facilities substantially different from those described in Licenses in
effect, CLEC must apply for and acquire a new License specifically describing the physical size, weight and
jacket material of the cable to be placed in AT&T-21STATE’s Conduits and Ducts or the physical size,
weight, and jacket type of cables and the size and weight of apparatus enclosures and other Facilities to be
attached to AT&T-21STATE Poles.
8.4 Each Application shall designate an employee as CLEC’s single point of contact for any and all purposes of that
Application under this Section, including, but not limited to, processing Licenses and providing records and

the Application is open.
9.0 Processing of Applications (Including Pre-License Surveys and Field Inspections)
9.1 CLEC’s Priorities:
9.1.1 When CLEC has multiple Applications on file with AT&T-21STATE, CLEC shall designate its desired priority
of completion of Pre-License Surveys and Make-Ready Work with respect to all such Applications.
9.2 Pre-License Survey:
9.2.1 After CLEC has submitted its written Application for a License, a Pre-License Survey (including a field
inspection) will be performed by either Party, in the company of a representative of the other Party as
mutually agreed, to determine whether AT&T-21STATE’s Poles, Anchors and Anchor/Guy Strands, or
Conduit System, in their present condition, can accommodate CLEC’s Facilities, without substantially
interfering with the ability of AT&T-21STATE or any other authorized person or entity to use or access the
Pole, Anchor or Anchor/Guy Strand or any portion of AT&T-21STATE's Conduit System or Facilities
attached to AT&T-21STATE’s Pole or placed within or connected to AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System. If
a Pre-License Survey is to be conducted by AT&T-21STATE, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC the Costs
to perform the Pre-License Survey. After receipt of CLEC’s payment of Pre-License Survey Costs, AT&T-
21STATE will schedule the survey. If CLEC gives its prior written consent in writing, the determination of
Duct availability may include the rodding of Ducts at CLEC’s expense.
9.2.1.1 The purpose of the Pre-License Survey is to determine whether CLEC’s proposed attachments
to AT&T-21STATE’s Poles or occupancy of AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit and Ducts will
substantially interfere with use of AT&T-21STATE’s Facilities by AT&T-21STATE and others
with Facilities occupying, connected or attached to AT&T-21STATE's Pole or Conduit System
and to determine what Make-Ready Work is required to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities on
AT&T-21STATE’s Poles, Joint Use Pole(s), or Conduit, Duct, or ROW and the cost associated
with AT&T-21STATE performing such Make-Ready Work and to provide information to CLEC for
its determination of whether the Pole, Anchor, Anchor/Guy Strand, Conduit, Duct, or ROW is
suitable for its use.
9.2.1.2 Based on information provided by AT&T-21STATE, CLEC shall determine whether AT&T-
21STATE's Pole, Anchor, Anchor/Guy Strand, Conduit and Duct Facilities are suitable to meet
CLEC’s needs.
9.2.1.3 AT&T-21STATE may not unreasonably refuse to continue to process an Application based on
AT&T-21STATE’s determination that CLEC’s proposed use of AT&T-21STATE’s Facilities will
not be in compliance with applicable requirements, specifications, rules, regulations, ordinances,
and laws. CLEC shall be responsible for making its own, independent determination that its use
of such Facilities will be in compliance with such requirements, specifications, rules, regulations,
ordinances and laws. CLEC acknowledges that AT&T-21STATE is not explicitly or implicitly

contained therein or connected thereto and that such changes may be necessitated by AT&T-21STATE’s
business needs or authorized Application of another entity seeking access to AT&T-21STATE’s Poles or
Conduit Systems. CLEC agrees that CLEC will, upon AT&T-21STATE’s request, and at AT&T-21STATE’s
expense, but at no Cost to CLEC, participate with AT&T-21STATE (and other CLECs) in the relocation,
reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement. CLEC
acknowledges that, from time to time, it may be necessary or desirable for AT&T-21STATE to change out
Poles, relocate, reconstruct, or modify portions of its Conduit System or rearrange Facilities contained
therein or connected thereto as a result of an order by a municipality or other governmental authority. CLEC
shall, upon AT&T-21STATE’s request, participate with AT&T-21STATE (and other CLECs) in the
relocation, reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement
and pay its proportionate share of any costs of such relocation, reconstruction, or modification that are not
reimbursed by such municipality or governmental authority.
14.2.2 CLEC shall make all rearrangements of its Facilities within such period of time as is jointly deemed
reasonable by the parties based on the amount of rearrangements necessary and a desire to minimize
chances for service interruption or Facility-based service denial to a CLEC End User.
14.2.3 If CLEC fails to make the required rearrangements within the time prescribed or within such extended
periods of time as may be granted by AT&T-21STATE in writing, AT&T-21STATE may perform such
rearrangements with written Notice to CLEC, and CLEC shall reimburse AT&T-21STATE for actual costs
and expenses incurred by AT&T-21STATE in connection with the rearrangement of CLEC’s Facilities;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section or any License issued hereunder shall be
construed as requiring CLEC to bear any expenses which, under the Act or other applicable federal or state
laws or regulations, are to be allocated to persons or entities other than CLEC; and provided further,
however, that CLEC shall have no responsibility for rearrangement costs and expenses relating to
rearrangements performed for the purpose of meeting AT&T-21STATE’s business needs.
15.0 Emergency Repairs and Pole Replacements
15.1 Responsibility for Emergency Repairs; Access to Maintenance Duct:
15.1.1 In general, each Party shall be responsible for making emergency repairs to its own Facilities and for
formulating appropriate plans and practices enabling such Party to make such repairs.
15.1.2 Nothing contained in this Appendix shall be construed as requiring either Party to perform any repair or
service restoration work of any kind with respect to the other Party’s Facilities or the Facilities of joint users.
15.1.3 Maintenance Ducts shall be available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for emergency repair activities by any
entity with Facilities in the Conduit section in which the maintenance Duct is located; provided, however, that
an entity using the maintenance Duct for emergency repair activities will notify AT&T-21STATE within
twelve (12) hours of the current Business Day (or first Business Day following a non-business day) that such
entity is entering the AT&T-21STATE Conduit system and using the maintenance Duct for emergency
restoral purposes. The notice will include a description of the emergency and non-emergency services
involved and an estimate of the completion time. Maintenance Ducts will be used to restore the highest
priority services, first. Existing spare Ducts may be used for restoration purposes providing the spare Ducts
are restored after restoration work is complete. Any spare Ducts not returned will be included to be
assigned to the user of the Duct and an occupancy permit issued.
15.1.4 The Attaching Party shall either vacate the maintenance Duct within thirty (30) calendar days or, with AT&T-
21STATE’s consent, rearrange its Facilities to ensure that at least one full-sized replacement maintenance
Duct (or, if the designated maintenance Duct was an inner-Duct, a suitable replacement inner-Duct) is
available for use by all occupants in the Conduit section within thirty (30) calendar days after such Attaching
Party occupies the maintenance Ducts. If Attaching Party fails to vacate the maintenance Duct as described
above, AT&T-21STATE may install a maintenance conduit at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.2 Designation of Emergency Repair Coordinators and Other Information:

15.2.1 For each AT&T-21STATE construction district, Attaching Party shall provide AT&T-21STATE with the
emergency contact number of Attaching Party’s designated point of contact for coordinating the handling of
emergency repairs of Attaching Party’s Facilities and shall thereafter notify AT&T-21STATE of changes to
such information.
15.3 Order of Precedence of Work Operations; Access to Maintenance Duct and Other Unoccupied Ducts in Emergency
Situations:
15.3.1 When notice and coordination are practicable, AT&T-21STATE, Attaching Party, and other affected parties
shall coordinate repair and other work operations in emergency situations involving service disruptions.
Disputes will be immediately resolved at the site by the affected parties present in accordance with the
following principles.
15.3.2 Emergency service restoration work requirements shall take precedence over other work operations.
15.3.3 Except as otherwise agreed upon by the parties, restoration of lines for emergency services providers (e.g.,
911, fire, police, national security and hospital lines) shall be given the highest priority and temporary
occupancy of the maintenance Duct (and, if necessary, other unoccupied Ducts) shall be assigned in a
manner consistent with this priority. Secondary priority shall be given to restoring services to the local
service providers with the greatest numbers of local lines out of service due to the emergency being
rectified. The parties shall exercise good faith in assigning priorities, shall base their decisions on the best
information then available to them at the site in question, and may, by mutual agreement at the site, take
other factors into consideration in assigning priorities and sequencing service restoration activities.
15.3.4 AT&T-21STATE shall determine the order of precedence of work operations and assignment of Duct space
in the maintenance Duct (and other unoccupied Ducts) only if the affected parties present are unable to
reach consensus provided, however, that these decisions shall be made by AT&T-21STATE on a
nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the principles set forth in this section.
15.4 Emergency Pole Replacements
15.4.1 When emergency pole replacements are required, AT&T-21STATE shall promptly make a good faith effort
to contact Attaching Party to notify Attaching Party of the emergency and to determine whether Attaching
Party will respond to the emergency in a timely manner.
15.4.2 If notified by AT&T-21STATE that an emergency exists which will require the replacement of a pole,
Attaching Party shall transfer its Facilities immediately, provided such transfer is necessary to rectify the
emergency. If the transfer is to an AT&T-21STATE replacement pole, the transfer shall be in accordance
with AT&T-21STATE’s placement instructions.
15.4.3 If Attaching Party is unable to respond to the emergency situation immediately, Attaching Party shall so
advise AT&T-21STATE and thereby authorize AT&T-21STATE (or any Other User sharing the pole with
AT&T-21STATE) to perform such emergency-necessitated transfers (and associated Facilities
rearrangements) on Attaching Party’s behalf at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.5 Expenses Associated with Emergency Repairs:
15.5.1 Each Party shall bear all reasonable expenses arising out of or in connection with emergency repairs of its
own Facilities and transfers or rearrangements of such Facilities associated with emergency pole
replacements made in accordance with the provisions of this article.
15.5.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for paying all persons and entities that provide materials, labor,
access to real or personal property, or other goods or services in connection with any such repair, transfer,
or rearrangement of such Party’s Facilities.
15.5.3 Attaching Party shall reimburse AT&T-21STATE for the Costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE for work

Manholes and the placement of CLEC’s Facilities in AT&T-21STATE’s Manholes.
16.2 Post-Construction Inspections:
16.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will, at the Attaching Party’s expense, conduct a post-construction inspection of the
Attaching Party’s attachment of Facilities to AT&T-21STATE’s Structures for the purpose of determining the
conformance of the attachments to the occupancy permit. AT&T-21STATE will provide the Attaching Party
advance written Notice of proposed date and time of the post-construction inspection. The Attaching Party
may accompany AT&T-21STATE on the post-construction inspection.
16.3 Periodic or Spot Inspections:
16.3.1 AT&T-21STATE shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make Periodic or Spot Inspections of all
Facilities attached to AT&T-21STATE’s Structure. Periodic Inspections will not be made more often than
once every two (2) years, unless in AT&T-21STATE’s judgment, such inspections are required for reasons
involving safety or because of an alleged violation of the terms of this Appendix.
16.3.2 AT&T-21STATE will give CLEC advance written Notice of such inspections, and CLEC shall have the right
to have a representative attend such inspections, except in those instances where safety considerations
justify the need for such inspection without the delay of waiting until written Notice has been forwarded to
CLEC.
16.3.3 Such inspections shall be conducted at AT&T-21STATE’s expense; provided, however, that CLEC shall
bear the Costs of inspections as delineated in Sections 16.1 above and 16.2.1 above.
16.3.4 If Attaching Party’s Facilities are in compliance with this Appendix, there will be no charges incurred by the
Attaching Party for the periodic or spot inspection. If Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with
this Appendix, AT&T-21STATE may charge Attaching Party for the inspection. The Costs of Periodic
Inspections will be paid by those Attaching Parties with 2% or greater of their Attachments in violation. The
amount paid by the Attaching Party shall be the percentage that their violations bear to the total violations of
all Attaching Parties found during the inspection.
16.3.5 If the inspection reflects that Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with the terms of this
Appendix, Attaching Party shall bring its Facilities into compliance within thirty (30) calendar days after being
notified of such noncompliance. If any make ready or modification work to AT&T-21STATE’s Structures is
required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the Attaching Party shall provide Notice to
AT&T-21STATE and the make ready work or modification will be treated in the same fashion as make
ready work or modifications for a new request for attachment. If the violation creates a hazardous condition,
Facilities must be brought into compliance upon notification.
16.4 Neither the act of inspection by AT&T-21STATE of CLEC’s Facilities nor any failure to inspect such Facilities shall
operate to impose on AT&T-21STATE any liability of any kind whatsoever or to relieve CLEC of any responsibility,
obligations or liability under this Section or otherwise existing.
16.5 Notice of Noncompliance:
16.5.1 If, at any time, AT&T-21STATE determines that Attaching Party’s Facilities or any part thereof have not
been placed or maintained or are not being used in accordance with the requirements of this Appendix,
AT&T-21STATE may send written Notice to Attaching Party specifying the alleged noncompliance.
Attaching Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of the Notice as soon as practicable. If Attaching Party does
not dispute AT&T-21STATE’s assertion that such Facilities are not in compliance, Attaching Party agrees to
provide AT&T-21STATE with a schedule for bringing such Facilities into compliance, to bring the Facilities
into compliance within a reasonable time, and to notify AT&T-21STATE in writing when the Facilities have
been brought into compliance.

compliance, Attaching Party shall notify AT&T-21STATE in writing of the basis for Attaching Party’s
assertion that its Facilities are in compliance.
16.7 Failure to Bring Facilities into Compliance:
16.7.1 If Attaching Party has not brought the Facilities into compliance within a reasonable time or provided AT&T-
21STATE with proof sufficient to persuade AT&T-21STATE that AT&T-21STATE erred in asserting that the
Facilities were not in compliance, and if AT&T-21STATE determines in good faith that the alleged
noncompliance causes or is likely to cause material damage to AT&T-21STATE’s Facilities or those of other
users, AT&T-21STATE may, at its option and Attaching Party’s expense, take such non-service affecting
steps as may be required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, including but not limited to
correcting any conditions which do not meet the specifications of this Appendix.
16.8 Correction of Conditions by AT&T-21STATE:
16.8.1 If AT&T-21STATE elects to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the provisions of this section
shall apply.
16.8.2 AT&T-21STATE will, whenever practicable, notify CLEC in writing before performing such work. The

performing the work.
16.8.3 If Attaching Party’s Facilities have become detached or partially detached from supporting racks or wall
supports located within an AT&T-21STATE Manhole, AT&T-21STATE may, at Attaching Party’s expense,
reattach them but shall not be obligated to do so. If AT&T-21STATE does not reattach Attaching Party’s
Facilities, AT&T-21STATE shall endeavor to arrange with Attaching Party for the reattachment of any
Facilities affected.
16.8.4 AT&T-21STATE shall, as soon as practicable after performing the work, advise Attaching Party in writing of
the work performed or action taken. Upon receiving such Notice, Attaching Party shall inspect the Facilities
and take such steps as Attaching Party may deem necessary to insure that the Facilities meet Attaching
Party’s performance requirements.

16.8.5.1 Attaching Party shall bear all expenses arising out of or in connection with any work performed to
bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance with this Section; provided, however that

requiring Attaching Party to bear any expenses which, under applicable federal or state laws or
regulations, must be borne by persons or entities other than Attaching Party.

poles or any part of AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System the Attaching Party’s Facilities, if AT&T-
21STATE determines that such Facilities are not the subject of a current occupancy permit and
are not otherwise lawfully present on AT&T-21STATE’s poles or in AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit
System.
18.2 Notice to Attaching Party:
18.2.1 If any of Attaching Party’s Facilities for which no occupancy permit is presently in effect are found attached
to AT&T-21STATE’s Poles or Anchors or within any part of AT&T-21STATE’s Conduit System, AT&T-
21STATE, without prejudice to other rights or remedies available to AT&T-21STATE under this Appendix,
and without prejudice to any rights or remedies which may exist independent of this Appendix, shall send a
written Notice to Attaching Party advising Attaching Party that no occupancy permit is presently in effect with
respect to the Facilities. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving a Notice, Attaching Party shall

amended Occupancy permit with respect to such Facilities.
18.3 Approval of Request and Retroactive Charges:

Attaching Party shall be liable to AT&T-21STATE for all fees and charges associated with the unauthorized
attachments as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this Agreement. The issuance of a new or amended
occupancy permit as provided by this article shall not operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-
21STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this Appendix or otherwise.
18.3.2 Attachment and Occupancy fees and charges shall continue to accrue until the unauthorized Facilities are
removed from AT&T-21STATE’s Poles, Conduit System or ROW or until a new or amended Occupancy
permit is issued and shall include, but not be limited to, all fees and charges which would have been due
and payable if Attaching Party and its predecessors had continuously complied with all applicable AT&T-
21STATE licensing requirements. Such fees and charges shall be due and payable thirty (30) calendar
days after the date of the bill or invoice stating such fees and charges. In addition, the Attaching Party shall
be liable for an unauthorized Attachment and/or Occupancy fee as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this
Agreement. Payment of such fees shall be deemed liquidated damages and not a penalty. In addition,
Attaching Party shall rearrange or remove its unauthorized Facilities at AT&T-21STATE’s request to comply
with applicable placement standards, shall remove its Facilities from any space occupied by or assigned to
AT&T-21STATE or another Other User, and shall pay AT&T-21STATE for all Costs incurred by AT&T-
21STATE in connection with any rearrangements, modifications, or replacements necessitated as a result of
the presence of Attaching Party’s unauthorized Facilities.

Facilities within the specified period of time, AT&T-21STATE shall by written Notice advise Attaching Party
to remove its unauthorized Facilities not less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of Notice and

remove Attaching Party’s Facilities at Attaching Party’s expense.
18.5 No Ratification of Unpermitted Attachments or Unauthorized Use of AT&T-21STATE’s Facilities:
18.5.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-21STATE with regard to any unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or
unauthorized use of AT&T-21STATE’s Structure shall be deemed to constitute a ratification by AT&T-
21STATE of the unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or use, nor shall the payment by Attaching Party of
fees and charges for unauthorized Pole attachments or Conduit Occupancy exonerate Attaching Party from
liability for any trespass or other illegal or wrongful conduct in connection with the placement or use of such

fees.
18.7 No Implied Waiver or Ratification of Unauthorized Use:
18.7.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-21STATE with regard to said unlicensed use shall be deemed as a
ratification of the unlicensed use; and if any License should be subsequently issued, said License shall not
operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-21STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this
Appendix or otherwise; provided, however, that CLEC shall be subject to all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities of this Appendix in regard to said unauthorized use from its inception.
19.0 Removal of CLEC’s Facilities
19.1 When Applicant no longer intends to occupy space on an AT&T-21STATE Pole or in a AT&T-21STATE Duct or
Conduit, Applicant will provide written notification to AT&T-21STATE that it wishes to terminate the Occupancy

19.5 Removal to Avoid Forfeiture:
19.5.1 If the presence of Attaching Party’s Facilities on or in AT&T-21STATE’s Structure would cause a forfeiture
of the rights of AT&T-21STATE to occupy the property where such Structure is located, AT&T-21STATE
will promptly notify Attaching Party in writing and Attaching Party shall not, without due cause and
justification, refuse to remove its Facilities within such time as may be required to prevent such forfeiture.

21STATE before the Commission, in the state which CLEC has either attached to or occupied AT&T-
21STATE structures (ROW, Conduits, Ducts, and/or Poles).

or occupied by CLEC to arrive at the total final amount due (“Total Final Price”). The Total Interim Price
shall be compared with the Total Final Price. If the Total Final Price is more than the Total Interim Price,
CLEC shall pay the difference to AT&T-21STATE. If the Total Final Price is less than the Total Interim
Price, AT&T-21STATE shall pay the difference to CLEC.
20.4.3 Each Party shall keep its own records upon which a “True-Up” can be based and any final payment from
one Party to the other shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Parties based on such records. In the event

Parties agree to follow the Dispute Resolution Process in the General Terms & Conditions to this
Agreement.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Nothing in this Attachment shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely impact in any manner either Party’s right
to employ or to request and be assigned any North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number resources from the
numbering administrator including, but not limited to, central office (NXX) codes pursuant to the Central Office Code
(NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s website) or thousand-blocks (NXX-X)
pursuant to the Thousands-Blocking Pooling Administration Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s
website), or to establish, by tariff or otherwise, Exchanges and Rate Centers corresponding to such NXX codes.
Each Party is responsible for administering the NXX codes it is assigned.
1.2 Prior to providing local service in an AT&T-21STATE local Exchange Area, CLEC shall obtain a separate numbering
resource (NXX or NXX-X) for each AT&T-21STATE Rate Center to ensure compliance with the industry-approved
Central Office Code (NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version) or other industry approved numbering
guidelines and the FCC’s Second Report & Order in CC Docket 95-116, released August 18, 1997 (Local Number
Portability). This will enable the Parties to identify the jurisdictional nature of traffic for Intercompany compensation
until such time as both Parties have implemented billing and routing capabilities to determine traffic jurisdiction on a
basis other than an NXX or an NXX-X.
1.3 Parties shall assign telephone numbers only to those End Users that are physically in the Rate Center to which the
NXX is assigned, subject to exceptions as noted in the numbering resource guidelines.
1.4 Each Party is responsible to program and update its own switches and network systems to recognize and route traffic
to the other Party’s assigned NXX codes at all times. Neither Party shall impose fees or charges on the other Party
for such required programming and updating activities.
1.5 Each Party is responsible to input required data into the Routing Data Base Systems (RDBS) and into the Telcordia
Business Integrated Routing and Rating Database System (BIRRDS) or other appropriate system(s) necessary to
update the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), unless negotiated otherwise.
1.6 Neither Party is responsible for notifying the other Party’s End Users of any changes in dialing arrangements,
including those due to NPA relief.
1.7 NXX Migration:
1.7.1 Where either Party has activated an entire NXX for a single End User, or activated more than half of an NXX
for a single End User with the remaining numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use or otherwise
unused, and such End User chooses to receive service from the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate
with the second Party to have the entire NXX reassigned in the LERG (and associated industry databases,
routing tables, etc.) to an End Office operated by the second Party provided that the requested rate center is
the same rate center that physically serves the End User in a non-Foreign Exchange arrangement. Such
transfer will require development of a transition process to minimize impact on the Network and on the End
User(s)’ service and will be subject to appropriate industry lead times (currently forty-five (45) calendar
days) for movements of NXXs from one switch to another. The Parties shall not charge each other as a
means for the other to recover costs associated with NXX Migration.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Foreign Exchange” or “FX”, as used in this Attachment, refers to number assignments and moves outside the Rate
Centers with which a telephone number is ordinarily associated, and is different from the term “FX” in Attachment 02
- Network Interconnection, which refers to number assignment and moves outside of a mandatory local calling area.
2.2 “Service Management System” or “SMS”, as used in the Attachment, is a database or computer system not part of
the public switched network that, (1) interconnects to a Service Control Point (SCP), and sends to that SCP the
information and call processing instructions needed for a network switch to process and complete a telephone call;
and (2) provides telecommunications carriers with the capability of entering and storing data regarding the processing
and completing of a telephone call.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
2.3 “Service Provider Number Portability (SPNP) Data Base Query” means the End User terminating calls from the “N-1”
Network to numbers in the Telephone Company’s network with NXX codes that have been designated as number
portable and the NXX has at least one number ported. AT&T-21STATE may be responsible for making a query to a
database containing information necessary to route calls to number portable NXX codes.
2.4 “Intermediate Numbers” means the numbers provided for use by resellers, numbers in dealer numbering pools,
numbers preprogrammed into End User premises equipment offered for retail sale, and numbers assigned to
messaging service providers.
2.5 “Safety Valve Request” means a mechanism for carriers to request numbering resources apart from the general
waiver process.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 Requirements for LNP:
3.1.1 The Parties shall provide to each other, on a reciprocal basis, number portability in accordance with
requirements of the Act and FCC Rules and Orders.
3.1.2 The Parties shall follow industry guidelines, including but not limited to North American Numbering Council
(NANC) Inter Service Provider Operations Flows, located on the Number Portability Administration Center's
(NPAC) website, regarding LNP for all aspects of number portability, including the time frames for providing
porting services to one another.
3.1.3 Either Party shall be permitted to block default-routed calls to protect the public switched telephone network
from overload, congestion, or failure propagation.
3.1.4 When a ported telephone number becomes vacant (e.g., the telephone number is no longer in service with
the original End User), the ported telephone number will be released back to the carrier owning the switch
(after aging if any) in which the telephone number’s NXX-X is native.
3.1.5 Each Party shall be responsible for the End User’s other Telecommunications related services and features,
(e.g., Directory Listings, E911, Line Information Database (LIDB), Operator Services), once that Party has
ported the End User’s telephone number to the Party’s switch.
3.1.6 When purchasing the SPNP Database Query, CLEC will access AT&T-21STATE facilities via an SS7 link.
3.1.7 Where triggers are not set, the Parties shall coordinate the porting of the number between service providers
so as to minimize service interruptions to the End User.
3.2 Limitations of Service for LNP:
3.2.1 Telephone numbers can be ported only within the Toll Message Rate Centers (TMRCs) as approved by the
Commissions. “Porting within Rate Centers” refers to a limitation of changing service providers while the
physical location of the End User remains with the wireline footprint of the Rate Center. If the End User
changes his, her or its physical location from one Rate Center to another, the End User may not retain his,
her or its telephone number (which is associated with the End User’s previous Rate Center) as a basic
network (non-FX) offering. An End User may retain his, her or its telephone number when moving from one
Rate Center to another by the use of a tariff FX or Remote Call Forwarding offering from the new service
provider.
3.2.2 Telephone numbers of the following types shall not be ported:
3.2.2.1 AT&T-21STATE Official Communications Services (OCS) NXXs;
3.2.2.2 555, 950, 956, 976 and 900 numbers;
3.2.2.3 N11 numbers (e.g., 411 and 911);

Attachment 04 - Local Number Portability and Numbering/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 7
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
3.2.2.4 Toll-free service numbers (e.g., 800, 888, 877 and 866); and
3.2.2.5 Disconnected or unassigned numbers.
3.2.3 Telephone numbers with NXXs dedicated to choke/High Volume Call-In (HVCI) networks are not portable
via LRN. Choke numbers will be ported as described in Section 4.4.7.2 below of this Attachment.
3.3 Numbering:
3.3.1 If fulfilling CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers results in AT&T-21STATE having to submit a request
for additional telephone numbers to a national numbering administrator (either NANPA CO Code
Administration, NeuStar Pooling Administration or their successors), AT&T-21STATE will submit the
required numbering request to the national numbering administrator to satisfy CLEC’s request for
intermediate numbers. AT&T-21STATE will also pursue all appropriate steps (including submitting a Safety
Valve Request (petition) to the Commission if the numbering request is denied by the national administrator)
to satisfy CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers. In these cases, AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to
fulfill the request by CLEC for intermediate numbers unless, and until, AT&T-21STATE’s request for
additional numbering resources is granted.
3.3.2 CLEC agrees to supply supporting information for any numbering request and/or Safety Valve Request that
AT&T-21STATE files pursuant to Section 3.3.1 above.
3.3.3 Each Party is responsible for providing to the other, valid test numbers; one number terminating to a voice
announcement identifying the Company and one number terminating to a milliwatt tone providing answer
supervision and allowing simultaneous connection from multiple test lines. Both numbers should remain in
service indefinitely for regressive testing purposes.
3.4 Local Number Portability (LNP) and Numbering:
3.4.1 Porting of Resale Numbers:
3.4.1.1 As the network provider, AT&T-21STATE will port telephone numbers, both in and out, on behalf
of CLEC at the request of an End User. CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE such information as
required to issue Local Service Requests (LSR) to port numbers in.
3.5 Non-discriminatory Access to Telephone Numbers:
3.5.1 Where AT&T-21STATE provides Resale services, AT&T-21STATE will provide telephone numbers as
defined by applicable FCC rules and regulations on a first come first served basis. CLEC acknowledges
that such access to telephone numbers shall be in accordance with the appropriate FCC rules, regulations
and industry guidelines.
4.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
4.1 Service Description for LNP:
4.1.1 The LRN software of the switch in which the assigned numbering resource (e.g., NXX or NXX-X) is native
determines if the called party is in a portable NXX. When a calling Party places a telephone call, if the
called party is in a portable NXX, a query will be launched to the LNP database to determine whether or not
the called number has been ported.
4.1.2 When the called number has been ported, an LRN will be returned to the switch that launched the query.
Following the query, the LRN of the called number will appear in the Called Party Number (CdPN) field of
the SS7 message and the called number will appear in the Generic Address Parameter (GAP) field.
4.1.3 When the query does not return an LRN, the call will be completed based upon the dialed digits.
4.1.4 When the LNP database is queried, the Forward Call Identifier (FCI) field’s entry will be changed from 0 to 1
by the switch triggering the query, regardless of whether the called number has been ported or not.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
4.1.5 Where technically feasible, the Parties shall populate the Jurisdiction Information Parameter (JIP) field with
the first six (6) digits (NPA NXX format) of the appropriate LRN of the originating switch.
4.2 “N-1” Query Methodology for LNP:
4.2.1 The Parties shall follow the “N-1” query methodology in performing queries of the LNP database, as
provided below. As provided by Industry standards, the “N-1” carrier is the carrier in the call routing
sequence immediately prior to the terminating carrier’s End Office, or the terminating carrier’s End Office
tandem. The “N-1” carrier shall perform the LNP database query. If the “N-1” carrier fails to perform the
LNP database query, the terminating carrier shall perform a query of the LNP database, and shall be
permitted to charge the “N-1” carrier for the query. Refer to the LNP Working Group Best Practice for
additional information, located in the Local Number Portability Administration section of the NPAC website.
4.2.2 For interLATA or intraLATA toll calls carried by another carrier, the originating carrier will pass the call to the
appropriate toll carrier, which will perform a query of the LNP database and efficiently route the call to the
appropriate terminating local carrier, either directly or through an access tandem office. Where one carrier
is the originating local service provider (LSP) and the other carrier is the designated toll carrier, the
designated toll carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating LSP will not query toll calls delivered to the toll
carrier or charge the toll carrier for such queries.
4.2.3 For local calls to ported numbers, the originating carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating carrier will query
the LNP database and route the call to the appropriate terminating carrier.
4.2.4 For local calls to any NXX from which at least one number has been ported, the Party that owns the
originating switch shall query an LNP database as soon as the call reaches the first LNP-capable switch in
the call path. The Party that owns the originating switch shall query on a local call to an NXX in which at
least one number has been ported via LNP prior to any attempts to route the call to any other switch. Prior
to the first number in an NXX being ported via LNP, AT&T-21STATE may query all calls directed to that
NXX, provided that AT&T-21STATE’s queries shall not adversely affect the quality of service to CLEC’s End
Users as compared to the service AT&T-21STATE provides its own End Users, and that queries to NXXs
where the first number has not been ported are not charged to the “N-1” Carrier.
4.2.5 A Party shall be charged for an LNP query by the other Party only if the Party to be charged is the N-1
carrier and was obligated to perform the LRN query but failed to do so, pursuant to conditions set forth in
CFR 47, Section 52.33. The only exception will be if the FCC rules (Docket No. 95-116) that the terminating
carrier may charge the “N-1” carrier for queries initiated before the first number is ported in an NXX.
4.2.6 Rates, terms and conditions for LNP queries performed by AT&T-21STATE are set forth in the applicable
FCC Tariff.
4.3 Ordering for LNP:
4.3.1 Porting of numbers from NXXs marked as portable in the LERG will be initiated via LSRs based on Ordering
and Billing Forum (OBF) guidelines and in accordance with the provisions of Attachment 07 - Operations
Support System (OSS).
4.3.2 For the purposes of this Attachment, the Parties may use a project management approach for the
implementation of LSRs for large quantities of ported numbers or for complex porting processes. With
regard to such managed projects, the Parties may negotiate implementation details such as, but not limited
to: Due Date, Cutover Intervals and Times, Coordination of Technical Resources, and Completion Notice.
4.4 Provisioning for LNP:
4.4.1 The Parties will remove a ported number from the End Office from which the number is being ported as
close to the requested time as reasonably practicable, except under the conditions listed in Section 4.4.3
below and Section 4.4.4 below, respectively. The Parties recognize that it is in the best interest of the End
User for this removal to be completed in the most expedient manner possible.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
4.4.2 Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger. If the Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger is set, calls originating from the old
switch will query the database and route to the new switch without the number being disconnected. The
ported number must be removed at the same time that the Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger is removed.
4.4.2.1 The Parties agree to provide Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger wherever technically feasible.
4.4.3 Project Orders. For project requests, the Parties will negotiate time frames for the disconnection of the
numbers in the old switch.
4.4.4 Coordinated Orders. Orders worked on a coordinated basis will be coordinated by the Parties until the
numbers are disconnected in the old switch.
4.4.5 The Parties shall cooperate in the process of porting numbers from one carrier to another so as to limit
service outage for the affected End User. The Parties will use their best efforts to update their respective
Local Service Management Systems (LSMS) from the NPAC SMS data within fifteen (15) minutes after
receipt of a download from the NPAC SMS (the current NANC goal for such updating).
4.4.6 At the time a telephone number is ported via LNP, the Party from which the number is being ported shall
insure that the LIDB entry for that number is de-provisioned.
4.4.7 Mass Calling:
4.4.7.1 The HVCI Network is designed to ease the network congestion that occurs when large numbers of
incoming telephone calls are solicited by an End User, such as a radio station or a ticket agency.
4.4.7.1.1 HVCI is also known as:
4.4.7.1.1.1 Choke Network
4.4.7.1.1.2 Mass Calling
4.4.7.1.1.3 Public Response Choke Network
4.4.7.2 Using a non-LRN process, AT&T-21STATE will offer the ability to port telephone numbers with
mass calling NXX codes via the use of pseudo codes or route index numbers.
4.4.8 Operator Services, LIDB and Directory Assistance:
4.4.8.1 The Provisions of this Agreement pertaining to Operator Services, LIDB and Directory Assistance
shall also apply when LNP is in place.
4.4.9 Porting of Direct Inward Dialing (DID) Block Numbers:
4.4.9.1 DID block numbers shall be portable in the same manner as other local telephone numbers,
subject to the modifications and/or limitations provided herein.
4.4.9.2 The Parties shall offer LNP to End Users for any portion of an existing DID block without being
required to port the entire block of DID numbers.
4.4.9.3 The Parties shall permit End Users which port a portion of DID numbers to retain DID service on
the remaining portion of the DID numbers, provided such is consistent with applicable tariffs.
5.0 Other
5.1 Pricing for LNP:
5.1.1 With the exception of lawful query charges, the Parties shall not charge each other for the porting of
telephone numbers as a means for the other to recover the costs associated with LNP.

E911 Customer may designate a PSAP as primary or secondary, which refers to the order in which calls are directed
for answering. Primary PSAPs answer calls; secondary PSAPs receive calls on a transfer basis. PSAPs are public
safety agencies such as police, fire, emergency medical, etc., or a common bureau serving a group of such entities.
2.13 “Selective Routing” (SR) means the routing and “E911 Selective Router” (E911 SR) means the equipment used to
route a call to 911 to the proper PSAP based upon the number and location of the caller. SR is controlled by an
ESN, which is derived from the location of the access line from which the 911 call was placed.
3.0 AT&T Responsibilities
3.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide and maintain such equipment at the E911 SR and the DBMS as is necessary to
provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to E911 Emergency Service as described in this Attachment.
3.2 Call Routing:
3.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will route 911 calls from the AT&T-21STATE SR to the designated primary PSAP or to
designated alternate locations, according to routing criteria specified by the PSAP.
3.2.2 AT&T-21STATE will forward the ANI to the calling party number it receives from CLEC and the associated
911 ALI to the PSAP for display. If no ANI is forwarded by CLEC, AT&T-21STATE will forward an
Emergency Service Central Office (ESCO) identification code for display at the PSAP. If ANI is forwarded
by the CLEC, but no ALI record is found in the E911 DBMS, AT&T-21STATE will report this “No Record
Found” condition to the CLEC in accordance with NENA standards.
3.3 Facilities and Trunking:
3.3.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide and maintain sufficient dedicated E911 Trunks from AT&T-21STATE’s E911
SR to the PSAP of the E911 Customer, according to provisions of the appropriate state Commission-
approved tariff and documented specifications of the E911 Customer.
3.3.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide facilities to interconnect the CLEC to the AT&T-21STATE’s E911SR, as
specified in Attachment 02 -Network Interconnection of this Agreement or per the requirements set forth via
the applicable state tariff. Additionally, CLEC has the option to secure interconnection facilities from another
provider or provide such interconnection using their own facilities. If diverse facilities are requested by
CLEC, AT&T-21STATE will provide such diversity where technically feasible, at standard applicable tariff
rates.
3.4 Database:
3.4.1 Where AT&T-21STATE manages the E911 Database, AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC access to the
E911 Database to store CLEC's End User “911 Records” (i.e., the name, address, and associated
telephone number(s) for each of CLEC’s End Users). CLEC or its representative(s) is responsible for
electronically providing End User 911 Records and updating this information.
3.4.2 Where AT&T-21STATE manages the E911 Database, AT&T-21STATE shall coordinate access to the
AT&T-21STATE DBMS for the initial loading and updating of CLEC End User 911 Records.
3.4.3 Where AT&T-21STATE manages the E911 Database, AT&T-21STATE’s E911 Database shall accept
electronically transmitted files that are based upon NENA standards. Manual (i.e., facsimile) entry shall be
utilized only in the event that the DBMS is not functioning properly.
4.0 CLEC Responsibilities
4.1 Call Routing (for CLEC’s own switches):

Attachment 05 - 911-E911/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 7
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 – CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
4.1.1 CLEC will transport the appropriate 911 calls from each Point of Interconnection (POI) to the appropriate
AT&T-21STATE E911 SR location.
4.1.2 CLEC will forward the ANI information of the party calling 911 to the AT&T-21STATE E911 SR.
4.2 Facilities and Trunking (for CLEC’s own switches):
4.2.1 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to each AT&T-21STATE E911 SR that
serves the Exchange Areas in which CLEC is authorized to and will provide Telephone Exchange Service.
4.2.2 CLEC acknowledges that its End Users in a single local calling scope may be served by different E911 SRs
and CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to route 911 calls from its End Users to
the proper E911 SR.
4.2.3 CLEC shall order a minimum of two (2) one-way outgoing E911 Trunk(s) dedicated for originating 911
Emergency Service calls for each default PSAP or default ESN to interconnect to each appropriate AT&T-
21STATE E911 SR, where applicable. Where Signaling System 7 (SS7) connectivity is available and
required by the applicable E911 Customer, the Parties agree to implement Common Channel Signaling
(CCS) trunking rather than Multi-Frequency (MF) trunking.
4.2.4 CLEC is responsible for ordering a separate E911 Trunk group from AT&T-21STATE for each county,
default PSAP or other geographic area that the CLEC serves if the E911 Customer for such county or
geographic area has a specified varying default routing condition. Where PSAPs do not have the technical
capability to receive 10-digit ANI, E911 traffic must be transmitted over a separate trunk group specific to
the underlying technology. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this
trunk group. Where the parties utilize SS7 signaling and the E911 network has the technology available,
only one (1) E911 Trunk group shall be established to handle multiple NPAs within the local Exchange Area
or LATA. If the E911 network does not have the appropriate technology available, a SS7 trunk group shall
be established per NPA in the local Exchange Area or LATA. In addition, 911 traffic originating in one (1)
NPA must be transmitted over a separate 911 Trunk group from 911 traffic originating in any other NPA 911.
4.2.5 CLEC shall maintain facility transport capacity sufficient to route 911 traffic over trunks dedicated to 911
Interconnection between the CLEC switch and the AT&T-21STATE E911 SR.
4.2.6 CLEC shall order sufficient trunking to route CLEC's originating 911 calls to the designated AT&T-21STATE
E911 SR.
4.2.7 Diverse (i.e., separate) 911 facilities are highly recommended and may be required by the Commission or
E911 Customer. If required by the E911 Customer, diverse 911 Trunks shall be ordered in the same
fashion as the primary 911 Trunks. CLEC is responsible for initiating trunking and facility orders for diverse
routes for 911 Interconnection.
4.2.8 CLEC is responsible for determining the proper quantity of trunks and transport facilities from its switch (es)
to interconnect with the AT&T-21STATE E911 SR.
4.2.9 CLEC shall engineer its 911 Trunks to attain a minimum P.01 grade of service as measured using the time
consistent average busy season busy hour twenty (20) day averaged loads applied to industry standard
Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity algorithms (using Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness
factor), or such other minimum grade of service as required by Applicable Law.
4.2.10 CLEC shall monitor its 911 Trunks for the purpose of determining originating network traffic volumes. If
CLEC's traffic study indicates that additional 911 Trunks are needed to meet the current level of 911 call
volumes, CLEC shall provision additional 911 Trunks for Interconnection with AT&T-21STATE.
4.2.11 CLEC is responsible for the isolation, coordination and restoration of all 911 facility and trunking
maintenance problems from CLEC’s demarcation (for example, collocation) to the AT&T-21STATE E911
SR(s). CLEC is responsible for advising AT&T-21STATE of the 911 Trunk identification and the fact that
the trunks are dedicated for 911 traffic when notifying AT&T-21STATE of a failure or outage. The Parties

agree to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve any 911 outage. AT&T-21STATE will refer
network trouble to CLEC if no defect is found in AT&T-21STATE’s 911 network. The Parties agree that 911
network problem resolution will be managed expeditiously at all times.
4.2.12 CLEC will not turn up live traffic until successful testing of E911 Trunks is completed by both Parties.
4.2.13 Where required, CLEC will comply with Commission directives regarding 911 facility and/or 911 Trunking
requirements.
4.3 Database:
4.3.1 Once the 911 Interconnection between CLEC and all appropriate AT&T-21STATE E911 SR(s) has been
established and tested, CLEC or its representatives shall be responsible for providing CLEC's End User 911
Records to AT&T-21STATE for inclusion in AT&T-21STATE’s DBMS on a timely basis.
4.3.2 CLEC or its agent shall provide initial and ongoing updates of CLEC's End User 911 Records that are
Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) valid in electronic format based upon established NENA standards.
4.3.3 CLEC shall adopt use of a Company/NENA ID on all CLEC End User 911 Records in accordance with
NENA standards. The Company ID is used to identify the carrier of record in facility configurations.
4.3.4 CLEC is responsible for providing AT&T-21STATE updates to the E911 database; in addition, CLEC is
responsible for correcting any errors that may occur during the entry of their data to the AT&T-21STATE
911 DBMS.
5.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
5.1 For CLEC’s own switch(es), both Parties shall jointly coordinate the provisioning of transport capacity sufficient to
route originating E911 calls from CLEC’s POI to the designated AT&T-21STATE E911 SR(s).
5.1.1 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC will cooperate to promptly test all trunks and facilities between CLEC's network
and the AT&T-21STATE E911 SR(s).
5.2 911 Surcharge Remittance to PSAP:
5.2.1 For CLEC’s own switch(es), the Parties agree that:
5.2.1.1 AT&T-21STATE is not responsible for collecting and remitting applicable 911 surcharges or fees
directly to municipalities or government entities where such surcharges or fees are assessed by
said municipality or government entity, and
5.2.1.2 AT&T-21STATE is not responsible for providing the 911 Customer detailed monthly listings of
the actual number of access lines, or breakdowns between the types of access lines (e.g.,
residential, business, payphone, Centrex, PBX, and exempt lines).
5.2.1.3 Facility based CLECs shall be responsible for collecting and remitting all applicable 911 fees and
surcharges on a per line basis to the appropriate PSAP or other governmental authority
responsible for collection of such fees and surcharges.
5.2.2 For Resellers, the ILEC shall serve as a clearinghouse between Resellers and PSAPs except where state
law requires Reseller to collect and remit directly to the appropriate 911 Authority. The Parties agree that:
5.2.2.1 AT&T-12STATE shall include Reseller information when providing the 911 Customer with
detailed monthly listings of the actual number of access lines, or breakdowns between the
types of access lines (e.g., residential, business, payphone, Centrex, PBX, and exempt lines).
5.2.2.2 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will provide the 911 Customer a monthly settlement
letter which provides the total number of access lines broken down into residence and

1.0 Introduction
1.1 The following services are provided as Customer Information Services – Operator Services/Directory Assistance
(OS/DA), Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW), Directory Assistance Listings (DAL) and White Pages.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches,
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service, or
1.2.1.3 Leased Local Circuit Switching from AT&T-21STATE.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates,
and CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the
OS/DA retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its
OS/DA retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where technically feasible and
available, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC
(see Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business
office” questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a
CLEC-provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.8 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 INW:
1.3.1 This Attachment also sets forth terms and conditions for INW for Facilities-Based CLECs.
1.3.2 Where technically feasible and available, when an operator dials the appropriate Toll Center Code in
addition to the inward code, the AT&T-21STATE INW operator will provide the Busy Line Verification (BLV)
service and Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I) service.
1.4 DAL:
1.4.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions under which CLEC agrees to purchase DAL information
from AT&T-21STATE.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/17/14
1.5 White Pages:
1.5.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Facility-Based CLECs for subscriber listing
information in white page directories provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Busy Line Verification (BLV)” means a service in which an End User asks an operator to verify a conversation in
progress.
2.2 “Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I)” means a service in which an End User asks an operator to verify and
interrupt a conversation in progress, to determine if one of the parties is willing to speak to the caller requesting the
interrupt.
2.3 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.4 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch, a Third Party provider’s switch
or via local circuit switching leased from AT&T-21STATE via a stand-alone agreement.
2.5 “General Assistance” means a service in which an operator calls the INW operator seeking assistance in dialing a
number. For example, the assistance could be required for attempting to dial a number where a ‘no ring’ condition
has been encountered.
2.6 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA), Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW),
Directory Assistance Listings (DAL) and White Pages.
2.7 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (ATC) code that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in
the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions. An
operator dials the appropriate area code + ATC + OPR SVC CODE to obtain INW.
3.0 Operator Services (OS) / Directory Services (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where technically feasible and/or available, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) within which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411,
1411, or 555-1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of
the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411, 1411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 06 – Customer Information Services/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 13
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/17/14
billing address, regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the
OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch (es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-
Digit Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized,
and a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements:
3.3.6.1 OS Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group
will be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the
trunk group transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then
the group will be designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for
combined services. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2 DA/ DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch
to the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk
group transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use
code and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together
on a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/17/14
traffic use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose
of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI) Trunks:
3.3.6.3.1 Where available, when CLEC wishes for AT&T-21STATE to perform Busy Line
Verification or Emergency Interrupt for CLEC End Users a segregated one-way
BLV trunk group with MF signaling from AT&T-21STATE’s OS switch to CLEC’s
switch serving End Users in that LATA will be required. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
The BLV trunk group will be designated with the appropriate traffic use code and
modifier.
3.4 OS Offerings:
3.4.1 OS Rate Structure:
3.4.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is
receiving (a) manual OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch
equipment voice recognition feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where
technically feasible and/or available). The Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and
nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 OS Call Processing:
3.4.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where technically feasible and/or available
to AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at
the time the CLEC End User makes an OS call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following OS
services to CLEC End User:
3.4.2.1.1 General Assistance - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS operator to
provide local and intraLATA dialing assistance for the purposes of completing calls,
or requesting information on how to place calls (e.g., handling emergency calls,
handling credits, etc.).
3.4.2.1.2 Calling Card - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, provides the OS operator with a
Calling Card number for billing purposes, and seeks assistance in completing the
call.
3.4.2.1.3 Collect - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS operator to bill the charges
associated with the call to the called number, provided such billing is accepted by
the called number.

3.5.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where technically feasible and
available to AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and

3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 The incoming OS/DA call is automatically answered by a pre-recorded greeting loaded into the OS/DA
switch itself. CLEC may custom brand or brand with silence.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner.
CLEC will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.2 If CLEC does not wish to custom brand the OS/DA calls, CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting
with the OS/DA switch by having AT&T-21STATE load a recording of silence into the automatic, pre-
recorded announcement slot, set for the shortest possible duration allowed by the switch, to then be routed
to OS/DA platform with all other OS/DA calls, for which brand loading charges will still apply.
3.6.2.1 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary
mechanical handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.2.2 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to
identify the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.3 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording or the silent announcement
into all applicable OS and/or DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at
parity with that provided to AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial

recording or silent announcement loading charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any
subsequent loading charges if new recordings or silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.4 Branding/Silent Announcement load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For
example, a CLEC Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations,
and therefore two separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the Branding/Silent
Announcement charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.5 Where CRR is technically feasible and/or available, the applicable CLEC-charged retail OS/DA rates and a
CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office or repair call center) are loaded
into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.6 Where CRR is available, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided OS/DA retail
rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will be responsible for
paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.
3.6.7 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where Consolidated Reference Rater is
available, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its
Facilities-Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and
therefore separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading
incurring the rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the
Pricing Sheet.
3.6.8 Converting End Users from Prior Branded Service to CLEC or Silent-Branded Service, or between Resale
and facilities-based service:
3.6.8.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.8.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring
charges apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6
above, and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW)
4.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:

CLEC’s responsibilities are described below.
4.1.2 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC

the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch utilizing MF signaling.
4.2 CLEC will request in writing, thirty calendar (30) days in advance of the date when the INW are to be provided,
unless otherwise agreed to by AT&T-21STATE. CLEC or its designated OS providers shall submit an ASR to AT&T-
21STATE to establish any new interconnection trunking arrangements.
4.2.1 CLEC must provide one (1) Carrier Identification Code (CIC) for its CLEC or Incumbent Exchange Carrier
business operation and an additional CIC for its IXC business operation if the CLEC wishes to receive
separate billing data for its CLEC and IXC operations.

directory publishers, CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s
receipt of the subscriber list information or for the subsequent release of this information to
directory publishers. Such CLEC subscriber list information shall be intermingled with AT&T-

this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE shall no longer be obligated to offer access and use of OSS for that ICA Service.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Service Bureau Provider (SBP)” means a company which has been engaged by a CLEC to act on its behalf for
purposes of accessing AT&T-21STATE OSS application-to-application interfaces via a dedicated connection over
which multiple CLEC’s local service transactions are transported.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-21STATE’s OSS are comprised of systems and processes that are in some cases region-specific (hereinafter
referred to as “Regional OSS”). Regional OSS is available only in the regions where such systems and processes
are currently operational.
3.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide electronic access to OSS via web-based GUIs and application-to-application interfaces.
These GUIs and interfaces will allow CLEC to perform pre-order, order, provisioning, maintenance and repair
functions. AT&T-21STATE will follow industry guidelines and the Change Management Process (CMP) in the
development of these interfaces.
3.3 AT&T-21STATE will provide all relevant documentation (manuals, user guides, specifications, etc.) regarding
business rules and other formatting information, as well as practices and procedures, necessary to handle OSS
related requests. All relevant documentation will be readily accessible at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
Documentation may be amended by AT&T-21STATE in its sole discretion from time to time. All Parties agree to
abide by the procedures contained in the then-current documentation.
3.4 AT&T-21STATE’s OSS are designed to accommodate requests for both current and projected demands of CLEC
and other CLECs in the aggregate.

3.11 AT&T-21STATE shall provide nondiscriminatory access to OSS processes. When OSS processes are not available
electronically, AT&T-21STATE shall make manual processes available.
3.12 The Parties agree that a collaborative CMP will be used to manage changes to existing interfaces, introduction of
new interfaces and retirement of interfaces. The CMP will cover changes to AT&T-21STATE’s electronic interfaces,
AT&T-21STATE’s CLEC testing environment, associated manual process improvements, and relevant
documentation. The process will define a procedure for resolution of CMP disputes.
3.13 Due to enhancements and on-going development of access to AT&T-21STATE CLEC OSS functions, certain
interfaces may be modified, may be temporarily unavailable, or may be phased out after execution of this Agreement.

of electronic access to OSS functionality. In addition, CLEC shall be responsible for and indemnifies AT&T-
21STATE against any cost, expense or liability relating to any unauthorized entry or access into, or use or
manipulation of AT&T-21STATE’s OSS from CLEC systems, workstations or terminals or by CLEC
employees, agents, or any Third Party gaining access through information and/or facilities obtained from or
utilized by CLEC and shall pay AT&T-21STATE for any and all damages caused by such unauthorized
entry.
3.15.2 CLEC’s access to pre-order functions will only be used to view Customer Proprietary Network Information
(CPNI) of another carrier’s End User where CLEC has obtained an authorization from the End User for
release of CPNI.
3.15.2.1 CLEC must maintain records of individual End Users’ authorizations for change in local
Exchange Service and release of CPNI which adhere to all requirements of state and federal
law, as applicable.
3.15.2.2 CLEC is solely responsible for determining whether proper authorization has been obtained and
holds AT&T-21STATE harmless from any loss on account of CLEC’s failure to obtain proper
CPNI consent from an End User. The Parties agree not to view, copy, or otherwise obtain
access to the customer record information about any other carriers’ End Users without proper

3.15.5 In the event AT&T-21STATE has good cause to believe that CLEC has used AT&T-21STATE OSS in a
way that conflicts with this Agreement or Applicable Law, AT&T-21STATE shall give CLEC written Notice
describing the alleged misuse (“Notice of Misuse”). CLEC shall immediately refrain from the alleged misuse
until such time that CLEC responds in writing to the Notice of Misuse, which CLEC shall provide to AT&T-
21STATE within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Misuse. In the event CLEC agrees
with the allegation of misuse, CLEC shall refrain from the alleged misuse during the term of this Agreement.
3.15.6 In the event CLEC does not respond to the Notice of Misuse or does not agree that the CLEC’s use of
AT&T-21STATE OSS is inconsistent with this Agreement or Applicable Law, then the Parties agree to the
following steps:
3.15.6.1 If such misuse involves improper access of pre-order applications or involves a violation of the
security guidelines contained herein, or negatively affects another OSS user’s ability to use OSS,
CLEC shall continue to refrain from using the particular OSS functionality in the manner alleged
by AT&T-21STATE to be improper, until CLEC has implemented a mutually agreeable remedy
to the alleged misuse.
3.15.6.2 To remedy the misuse for the balance of the Agreement, the Parties will work together as
necessary to mutually determine a permanent resolution for the balance of the term of the
Agreement.
3.16 In order to determine whether CLEC has engaged in the alleged misuse described in the Notice of Misuse, AT&T-
21STATE shall have the right to conduct an audit of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-21STATE OSS. Such audit shall be
limited to auditing those aspects of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-21STATE OSS that relate to the allegation of misuse as
set forth in the Notice of Misuse. AT&T-21STATE shall give ten (10) calendar days advance written Notice of its
intent to audit CLEC (“Audit Notice”) under this Section, and shall identify the type of information needed for the audit.
Such Audit Notice may not precede the Notice of Misuse. Within a reasonable time following the Audit Notice, but no
less than fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of the Audit Notice (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties),
CLEC shall provide AT&T-21STATE with access to the requested information in any reasonably requested format, at
an appropriate CLEC location, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. The audit shall be at AT&T-21STATE’s
expense. All information obtained through such an audit shall be deemed proprietary and/or confidential and subject
to confidential treatment without necessity for marking such information confidential. AT&T-21STATE agrees that it
shall only use employees or outside parties to conduct the audit who do not have marketing, strategic analysis,
competitive assessment or similar responsibilities within AT&T-21STATE. If CLEC fails to cooperate in the audit,
AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to terminate CLEC’s access to electronic processes.

telephone number where applicable. CLEC shall provide such End User service records within twenty-four (24)
hours of a valid request, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
4.4 Data validation files provided are described on the AT&T CLEC Online website. These files provide an alternate
method of acquiring pre-ordering information that is considered relatively static and are available via the pre-order
GUI, AT&T’s CLEC Online website, or other distribution methods.
5.0 Ordering
5.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide ordering functionality. To order any ICA Services CLEC will format a Local Service
Request (LSR) to identify the features, services or elements CLEC is requesting AT&T-21STATE to provision in
accordance with applicable AT&T-21STATE ordering requirements and other terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Ordering requirements are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.2 In ordering and provisioning, Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT) and local Interconnection trunks, CLEC and
AT&T-21STATE will use industry Access Service Request (ASR) guidelines, based upon AT&T-21STATE ordering
requirements. AT&T-21STATE’s ASR guidelines are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.3 AT&T-21STATE product/service intervals are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.4 AT&T-21STATE shall return a Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) in accordance with the applicable performance
intervals. CLEC shall provide to AT&T-21STATE an FOC per the guidelines located on AT&T’s CLEC Online
website.
5.5 When an AT&T-21STATE provided ICA Service is replaced by CLEC’s facility-based service using any AT&T-
21STATE provided ICA Services, CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests, to both disconnect the existing
service and order ICA Services. These requests will be processed by AT&T-21STATE, and CLEC will be charged
the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each individual ICA
Service and cross-connect ordered. Similarly, when an End User is served by one CLEC using AT&T-21STATE
provided ICA Services is converted to another CLEC’s service using any AT&T-21STATE provided ICA Services, the
requesting CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests to both disconnect the existing service and connect new
service to the requesting CLEC End User. These requests will be processed by AT&T-21STATE and the CLEC will
be charged the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each
individual ICA Service and cross-connect ordered.
5.6 AT&T-21STATE shall bill to CLEC an LSR charge and/or appropriate service order charges based on the manner in
which the order is submitted (e.g. manually, semi-mechanized, mechanized) at the rate set forth in the applicable
Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides to this Agreement for each LSR submitted. An
individual LSR will be identified for billing purposes by its Purchase Order Number (PON).
5.7 The Commissions, in some states, have ordered per element manual additive nonrecurring charges for ICA Services
ordered by means other than one of the interactive interfaces (“Additional Charges”). Additional Charges shall
charges will apply in these states as set forth in the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or
service guides.
6.0 Provisioning
6.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory provisioning of ICA Services. Access to order status and
provisioning order status is available via the regional pre-ordering and ordering GUIs, AT&T’s CLEC Online website,
and application-to-application interfaces.
6.2 AT&T-21STATE shall provision services during its regular working hours. To the extent CLEC requests provisioning
of service to be performed outside AT&T-21STATE’s regular working hours, or the work so requested requires
AT&T-21STATE’s technicians or project managers to work outside of regular working hours, AT&T-21STATE will
assess overtime charges set forth in the Pricing Schedule/AT&T-21STATE’s intrastate Access Services Tariff.
6.3 In the event AT&T-21STATE must dispatch to the End User’s location more than once for provisioning of ICA
Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect contact

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems/AT&T-21STATE
Page 7 of 13
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 4Q14 - CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
name/number, etc.), AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to provision the circuit due
to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-21STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges from the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides.
6.4 Cancellation Charges:
6.4.1 If CLEC cancels an order for ICA Services subsequent to AT&T-21STATE’s generation of a service order,
any costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE in conjunction with provisioning of services as requested on the
cancelled LSR will be recovered in accordance with the cancellation methodology set forth in the
Cancellation Charge Percentage Chart found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website. In addition, AT&T-
21STATE reserves the right to assess cancellation charges if CLEC fails to respond within nine (9)
Business Days to a Missed Appointment order notification.
6.4.1.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CLEC places an LSR based upon AT&T-21STATE’s loop
makeup information, and such information is inaccurate resulting in the inability of AT&T-
21STATE to provision the ICA Services requested and another spare compatible facility cannot
be found with the transmission characteristics of the ICA Services originally requested,
cancellation charges shall not apply. Where CLEC places a single LSR for multiple ICA Services
based upon loop makeup information, and information as to some, but not all, of the ICA
Services is inaccurate, if AT&T-21STATE cannot provision the ICA Services that were the
subject of the inaccurate loop makeup information, CLEC may cancel its request for those ICA
Services without incurring cancellation charges. In such instance, should CLEC elect to cancel
the entire LSR, cancellation charges as shall apply to those ICA Services that were not the
subject of inaccurate loop makeup.
6.5 Expedite Charges:
6.5.1 For Expedite requests by CLEC, charges from the Pricing Schedule will apply for intervals less than the
standard interval as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
6.6 Order Modification Charges:
6.6.1 If CLEC modifies an order after being sent a FOC from AT&T-21STATE, the Order Modification Charge
(OMC) or Order Modification Charge Additional Dispatch (OMCAD) will be accessed from the Pricing
Schedule as applicable.
7.0 Maintenance/Repair
7.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC with access to electronic interfaces for the purpose of reporting and monitoring
trouble.
7.2 The methods and procedures for trouble reporting outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website shall be used.
7.3 AT&T-21STATE will maintain, repair and/or replace ICA Services in accordance with the FCC requirements and
applicable tariffs.
7.4 CLEC shall make available at mutually agreeable times the 251(c)(3) UNEs provided pursuant to this Agreement in
order to permit AT&T-21STATE to test and make adjustments appropriate for maintaining the 251(c)(3) UNEs in
satisfactory operating condition. No credit will be allowed for any interruptions involved during such testing and
adjustments.
7.5 Neither CLEC or its End Users shall rearrange, move, disconnect, remove or attempt to repair any facilities owned by
AT&T-21STATE except with the prior written consent of AT&T-21STATE.
7.6 CLEC will be responsible for testing and isolating troubles on ICA Services. CLEC must test and isolate trouble to
the AT&T-21STATE network before reporting the trouble to the Maintenance Center. Upon request from AT&T-
21STATE at the time of the trouble report, CLEC will be required to provide the results of the CLEC test isolating the
trouble to the AT&T-21STATE network.

AT&T-21STATE.
7.9 AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to contact CLEC’s End Users, if deemed necessary, for provisioning or
maintenance purposes.
7.10 Repair requests are billed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If CLEC reports a trouble on a
AT&T-21STATE ICA Service and no trouble is found in AT&T-21STATE’s network, AT&T-21STATE will charge
CLEC a Maintenance of Service Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material
Charges/Additional Labor Charges for any dispatching and testing (both inside and outside the Central Office)
required by AT&T-21STATE in order to confirm the working status. AT&T-21STATE will assess these charges at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule and/or applicable tariffs.
7.11 In the event AT&T-21STATE must dispatch to an End User’s location more than once for repair or maintenance of
ICA Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect
contact name/number, etc.), AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to repair the circuit
due to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-21STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
7.12 CLEC shall pay Time and Material charges when AT&T-21STATE dispatches personnel and the trouble is in
equipment or communications systems provided an entity by other than AT&T-21STATE or in detariffed CPE
provided by AT&T-21STATE, unless covered under a separate maintenance agreement.
7.13 CLEC shall pay Maintenance of Service charges when the trouble clearance did not otherwise require dispatch, but
dispatch was requested for repair verification or cooperative testing, and the circuit did not exceed maintenance
limits.
7.14 If CLEC issues a trouble report allowing AT&T-21STATE access to End User's premises and AT&T-21STATE
personnel are dispatched but denied access to the premises, then Time and Material charges will apply for the period
of time that AT&T-21STATE personnel are dispatched. Subsequently, if AT&T-21STATE personnel are allowed
access to the premises, these charges will still apply.
7.15 Time and Material charges apply on a first and additional basis for each half-hour or fraction thereof. If more than
one technician is dispatched in conjunction with the same trouble report, the total time for all technicians dispatched
will be aggregated prior to the distribution of time between the “First Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” and “Each
Additional Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” rate categories. Basic Time is work-related efforts of AT&T-21STATE
performed during normally scheduled working hours on a normally scheduled workday. Overtime is work-related
efforts of AT&T-21STATE performed on a normally scheduled workday, but outside of normally scheduled working
hours. Premium Time is work related efforts of AT&T-21STATE performed other than on a normally scheduled
workday.
7.15.1 If CLEC requests or approves an AT&T-21STATE technician to perform services in excess of or not
otherwise contemplated by the nonrecurring charges herein, CLEC will pay Time and Material charges for
any additional work to perform such services, including requests for installation or other work outside of
normally scheduled working hours.
8.0 Billing
8.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory access to associated billing information as necessary to
allow CLEC to perform billing functions.

21STATE, as appropriate to the ownership of a failed component. As necessary, CLEC and AT&T-
21STATE will work together to resolve problems where the responsibility of either Party is not easily
identified.
9.5 Information Security Policies And Guidelines For Access To Computers, Networks and Information By Non-Employee
Personnel:
9.5.1 Information security policies and guidelines are designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and
availability of computer, networks and information resources. Section 9.6 below through Section 9.12 below
inclusive summarizes the general policies and principles for individuals who are not employees of the Party
that provides the computer, network or information, but have authorized access to that Party’s systems,
networks or information. Questions should be referred to CLEC or AT&T-21STATE, respectively, as the
providers of the computer, network or information in question.
9.5.2 It is each Party’s responsibility to notify its employees, contractors and vendors who will have access to the
other Party’s network, on the proper security responsibilities identified within this Attachment. Adherence to
these policies is a requirement for continued access to the other Party’s systems, networks or information.
Exceptions to the policies must be requested in writing and approved by the other Party’s information
security organization.
9.6 General Policies:
9.6.1 Each Party’s resources are for approved this Agreement’s business purposes only.

Version: 4Q14 - CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
9.6.3 Individuals will only be given access to resources that they are authorized to receive and which they need to
perform their job duties. Users must not attempt to access resources for which they are not authorized.
9.6.4 Authorized users shall not develop, copy or use any program or code which circumvents or bypasses
system security or privilege mechanism or distorts accountability or audit mechanisms.
9.6.5 Actual or suspected unauthorized access events must be reported immediately to each Party’s security
organization or to an alternate contact identified by that Party. Each Party shall provide its respective
security contact information to the other.
9.7 User Identification:
9.7.1 Access to each Party’s corporate resources will be based on identifying and authenticating individual users
in order to maintain clear and personal accountability for each user’s actions.
9.7.2 User identification shall be accomplished by the assignment of a unique, permanent user ID, and each user
ID shall have an associated identification number for security purposes.
9.7.3 User IDs will be revalidated on a monthly basis.
9.8 User Authentication:
9.8.1 Users will usually be authenticated by use of a password. Strong authentication methods (e.g. one-time
passwords, digital signatures, etc.) may be required in the future.
9.8.2 Passwords must not be stored in script files.
9.8.3 Passwords must be entered by the user.
9.8.4 Passwords must be at least six (6) to eight (8) characters in length, not blank or a repeat of the user ID;
contain at least one (1) letter, and at least one (1) number or special character must be in a position other
than the first or last position. This format will ensure that the password is hard to guess. Most systems are
capable of being configured to automatically enforce these requirements. Where a system does not
mechanically require this format, the users must manually follow the format.
9.8.5 Systems will require users to change their passwords regularly (usually every thirty-one (31) days).
9.8.6 Systems are to be configured to prevent users from reusing the same password for six (6) changes/months.
9.8.7 Personal passwords must not be shared. Any user who has shared his password is responsible for any use
made of the password.
9.9 Access and Session Control:
9.9.1 Destination restrictions will be enforced at remote access facilities used for access to OSS Interfaces.
These connections must be approved by each Party’s corporate security organization.

9.12 Monitoring and Audit:
9.12.1 To deter unauthorized access events, a warning or no trespassing message will be displayed at the point of
initial entry (i.e., network entry or applications with direct entry points). Each Party should have several
approved versions of this message. Users should expect to see a warning message similar to this one:
“This is a(n) (AT&T or CLEC) system restricted to Company official business and subject
to being monitored at any time. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such
monitoring and to any evidence of unauthorized access, use, or modification being used
for criminal prosecution.”
9.12.2 After successful authentication, each session will display the last logon date/time and the number of
unsuccessful logon attempts. The user is responsible for reporting discrepancies.
10.0 Miscellaneous
10.1 To the extent AT&T-21STATE seeks to recover costs associated with OSS system access and connectivity, AT&T-
21STATE shall not be foreclosed from seeking recovery of such costs via negotiation, arbitration, or generic
proceeding during the term of this Agreement.
10.2 Unless otherwise specified herein, charges for the use of AT&T-21STATE’s OSS, and other charges applicable to
pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning and maintenance and repair, shall be at the applicable rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule.
10.3 Single Point of Contact:
10.3.1 CLEC will be the single point of contact with AT&T-21STATE for ordering activity for ICA Services used by
CLEC to provide services to its End Users, except that AT&T-21STATE may accept a request directly from
another CLEC, or AT&T-21STATE, acting with authorization of the affected End User. Pursuant to a
request from another carrier, AT&T-21STATE may disconnect any ICA Service being used by CLEC to
provide service to that End User and may reuse such network elements or facilities to enable such other
carrier to provide service to the End User. AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been
processed but will not be required to notify CLEC in advance of such processing.
10.4 Use of Facilities:
10.4.1 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another LEC, including
AT&T-21STATE, AT&T-21STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as ICA Services, and regardless of whether the End User served
with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or otherwise.
AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
10.5 AT&T-21STATE will provide loss notifications to CLEC. This notification alerts CLEC that a change requested by
another Telecommunications provider has/or may result in a change in the Local Service Provider associated with a
given telephone number. It will be provided via the ordering GUI and application-to-application interfaces and
AT&T’s CLEC Online website, as applicable.

11.0 Service Bureau Provider Arrangements for Shared Access to OSS
11.1 Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement regarding access to OSS to the contrary, CLEC shall be permitted
to access AT&T-21STATE OSS via a Service Bureau Provider as follows:
11.1.1 CLEC shall be permitted to access AT&T-21STATE application-to-application OSS interfaces, via a Service
Bureau Provider where CLEC has entered into an agency relationship with such Service Bureau Provider,
and the Service Bureau Provider has executed an Agreement with AT&T-21STATE to allow Service Bureau
Provider to establish access to and use of AT&T-21STATE’s OSS.
11.1.2 CLEC’s use of a Service Bureau Provider shall not relieve CLEC of the obligation to abide by all terms and
conditions of this Agreement. CLEC must ensure that its agent properly performs all OSS obligations of
CLEC under this Agreement, which CLEC delegates to Service Bureau Provider.
11.1.3 It shall be the obligation of CLEC to provide Notice in accordance with the Notice provisions of the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement whenever it establishes an agency relationship with a Service
Bureau Provider or terminates such a relationship. AT&T-21STATE shall have a reasonable transition time
to establish a connection to a Service Bureau Provider once CLEC provides Notice. Additionally, AT&T-
21STATE shall have a reasonable transition period to terminate any such connection after Notice from
CLEC that it has terminated its agency relationship with a Service Bureau Provider.
11.2 AT&T-21STATE shall not be obligated to pay liquidated damages or assessments for noncompliance with a
performance measurement to the extent that such noncompliance was the result of actions or events beyond AT&T-
21STATE’s control associated with Third Party systems or equipment including systems, equipment and services
provided by a Service Bureau Provider (acting as CLEC’s agent for connection to AT&T-21STATE’s OSS) which
could not be avoided by AT&T-21STATE through the exercise of reasonable diligence or delays or other problems
resulting from actions of a Service Bureau Provider, including Service Bureau provided processes, services, systems
or connectivity.

Page 3 of 4
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 4Q14 - CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
1.0 Introduction
1.1 The Parties agree that CLEC is entitled to order any Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be made available
by FCC requirements pursuant to the Act. A Bona Fide Request (BFR) is to be used when CLEC makes a request of
AT&T-21STATE to provide a new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element that is not currently offered by AT&T-
21STATE but is required to be made available via the Act.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “BFR” means a Bona Fide Request pursuant to the Act.
2.2 “Complex Request Evaluation Fee” means an Individual Case Basis (ICB) fee to compensate AT&T-21STATE for
the extraordinary expenses directly related to the CLEC’s BFR which is a complex request that requires the allocation
and engagement of additional resources above the existing allocated resources used on BFR cost development
which include, but are not limited to, expenditure of funds to develop feasibility studies, specific resources that are
required to determine request requirements (such as operation support system analysts, technical managers,
software developers), software impact analysis by specific software developers; software architecture development,
hardware impact analysis by specific system analysts, etc.
2.3 “Development Rate” means the estimated cost for AT&T-21STATE to develop the new or modified 251(c)(3) element
and other network elements.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 A BFR shall be submitted by CLEC on the BFR Application Form, located on the AT&T CLEC Online website to their
designated AT&T-21STATE Senior Carrier Accounts Manager (SrCAM) and shall specifically identify the requested
service date, technical requirements, and/or such other specifications that clearly define the request such that AT&T-
21STATE has sufficient information to analyze and prepare a response. Such a request shall also include CLEC’s
designation of the BFR being pursuant to the Act.
3.1.1 CLEC shall include with its BFR Application Form a “BFR Deposit” to cover preliminary evaluation costs.
See Pricing Schedule for the BFR Deposit amount.
3.1.2 If the BFR Deposit amount identified in the Pricing Schedule is not made at the time of the BFR Application,
CLEC shall be responsible for all preliminary evaluation costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE to complete the
preliminary analysis (regardless of whether such costs are greater or lesser than the BFR Deposit amount in
the Pricing Schedule).
3.1.3 If CLEC submits a BFR Deposit with its BFR, and AT&T-21STATE is not able to process the request or
determines that the request does not qualify for BFR treatment, then AT&T-21STATE will credit the BFR
Deposit amount to the CLEC’s account. Similarly, if the costs incurred to complete the Preliminary Analysis
are less than the BFR Deposit, the balance of the deposit will, at the option of CLEC, either be credited
toward the CLEC’s account or credited toward any additional developmental costs authorized by CLEC.
3.2 Within two (2) Business Days of AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of a fully complete and valid BFR, AT&T-21STATE shall
acknowledge, in writing, its receipt and identify a single point of contact responsible for responding to the BFR and
shall request any additional information needed to process the BFR to the extent known at that time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-21STATE may reasonably request additional information from CLEC at any
time during the processing of the BFR.
3.3 For any new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be unbundled by Act, if AT&T-21STATE
determines that the preliminary analysis of the requested BFR is of such complexity that it will cause AT&T-
21STATE to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR, AT&T-21STATE shall notify CLEC within ten (10)
Business Days of AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the BFR that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee will be required prior
to the preliminary analysis of the BFR being performed by AT&T-21STATE. If CLEC accepts the Complex Request
Evaluation Fee proposed by AT&T-21STATE, CLEC shall submit such fee within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-
21STATE’s notice that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee is required. AT&T-21STATE will not be obligated to
further process the BFR until such Complex Request Evaluation Fee is received by AT&T-21STATE. Within thirty

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 4Q14 - CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
(30) Business Days of AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, AT&T-21STATE shall
respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis.
3.4 If AT&T-21STATE is not required to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR as described in Section 3.3
above, then within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s fully complete and valid BFR,
AT&T-21STATE shall respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis of the new or modified Section 251 or
251(c)(3) element. The preliminary analysis shall confirm either that AT&T-21STATE will or will not offer the new or
modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element.
3.5 CLEC may cancel a BFR at any time up until thirty (30) Business Days after receiving AT&T-21STATE’s preliminary
analysis. If CLEC cancels the BFR within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of AT&T-21STATE’s preliminary
analysis, AT&T-21STATE shall be entitled to retain the BFR Deposit or any Complex Request Evaluation Fee, minus
those costs that have not been incurred by AT&T-21STATE as of the date of cancellation.
3.6 CLEC will have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the preliminary analysis to accept the preliminary analysis.
CLEC must provide acceptance of the preliminary analysis in writing and provide the payment of the estimated
Development Rate for the new or modified network element quoted in the preliminary analysis. If CLEC fails to
respond within this thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR will be deemed cancelled.
3.7 As soon as feasible, but not more than ninety (90) calendar days after AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s written
acceptance of the preliminary analysis and payment of the estimated Development Rate, AT&T-21STATE shall
provide to CLEC a firm price quote. The firm price quote will include any additional Development Rates, the
nonrecurring rate and the recurring rate, and a detailed implementation plan. The firm nonrecurring rate will not
include any of the Development Rate or the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, if required, in the calculation of this
rate.
3.8 CLEC shall have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the firm price quote to accept or deny the firm price quote
in writing and submit any additional Development Rates or nonrecurring rates quoted in the firm price quote. If
AT&T-21STATE does not receive Notice of any of the foregoing within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR
shall be deemed canceled. CLEC shall be responsible to reimburse AT&T-21STATE for its costs incurred up to the
date of cancellation (whether affirmatively canceled or deemed canceled by AT&T-21STATE).
3.9 Unless CLEC agrees otherwise, all prices shall be consistent with the applicable pricing principles and provisions of
the Act.
3.10 If CLEC believes that AT&T-21STATE’s firm price quote is not consistent with the requirements of the Act, either
Party may seek dispute resolution in accordance with the Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
3.11 Upon agreement to the rates, terms and conditions of the BFR, an amendment to this Agreement may be required
and the Parties shall negotiate such amendment in good faith.

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 2Q14 - CLEC ICA – 04/03/14
1.0 General Provisions
1.1 The Performance Measurements Plans referenced herein, notwithstanding any provisions in any other attachment in
this Agreement, are not intended to create, modify or otherwise affect Parties’ rights and obligations. The existence
of any particular performance measure, or the language describing that measure, is not evidence that CLEC is
entitled to any particular manner of access, nor is it evidence that AT&T-21STATE is limited to providing any
particular manner of access. The Parties’ rights and obligations to such access are defined elsewhere, including the
relevant laws, FCC and Commission decisions/regulations and within this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T-21STATE’s implementation of the Performance Measurements Plans addressed by this Attachment
(Performance Measurement Plan(s), the Plan(s)) will not be considered as an admission against interest or an
admission of liability in any legal, regulatory, or other proceeding relating to the same performance. The Parties
agree that CLEC may not use the existence of such Plans as evidence that AT&T-21STATE has discriminated in the
provision of any facilities or services under Sections 251 or 252, or has violated any state or federal law or regulation.
AT&T-21STATE’s conduct underlying its performance, and the performance data provided under the Performance
Measurements Plans, however, are not made inadmissible by these terms. AT&T-21STATE’s performance as
measured by these plans may not be used as an admission of liability or culpability for a violation of any state or
federal law or regulation.
1.3 Nothing herein shall be interpreted to be a waiver of AT&T-21STATE’s right to argue and contend in any forum, in
the future, that Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 do not impose any duty or legal
obligation to negotiate and/or mediate or arbitrate a self-executing liquidated damages or remedy plan.

Exchange and not in the originating State.
6.4 CLEC agrees to pay AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE a processing charge in consideration of AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE’s performance of CH services. This charge is located in the Pricing Schedule.
6.5 CLEC agrees to pay a per message charge to the LEC responsible for billing the message, including AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE when AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE bills the message. This charge is
located in the Pricing Schedule.
6.6 The Parties agree that processing of retroactive messages through the CH is acceptable, if such messages utilize the
industry standard format for call records, pursuant to 6.3 above. The Parties agree that lost messages are the
complete responsibility of the originating LEC or CLEC. If messages are lost by any Party, and cannot be recreated
or retransmitted, the originating LEC or CLEC will estimate messages, minutes, and associated revenues based on
the best available data. No estimate will be made for messages, which are more than two (2) years old at the time
the estimate is made. The estimates will be off-line calculations (i.e., not part of the routine CH processing) and will
be included as a supplement to the monthly settlement report.
7.0 CH Responsibilities of the Parties
7.1 CLEC agrees that it will provide AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE billing records for CH processing that are in
industry standard format acceptable to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. The records shall at minimum
display the telephone number of the End User to whom the call is to be billed, and data about the call sufficient for a
carrier to comply with all applicable state regulatory billing requirements. CH Records will detail intraLATA toll calls
which were originated by use of the single digit access code (i.e., 0+ and 0-) in one LEC or CLEC Exchange but are
to be billed to an End User in a second LEC’s or CLEC Exchange. Such records are referred to as category ninety-
two (92) records for CH processing purposes.
7.2 CLEC agrees that all CH Records it generates will display indicators denoting whether category ninety-two (92)
Records should be forwarded to CH. CLEC will retain its originating records for ninety (90) calendar days such that
the category ninety-two (92) Records can be retransmitted to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE for CH
processing, if needed.
7.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will provide and maintain such systems it believes are required to furnish
the CH service described herein. AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, in its capacity as operator of the CH,
agrees to retain all CH Records processed through the CH for two (2) years.
7.4 CLEC will timely furnish to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE all CH Records required to provide the CH
service.
7.5 Presently, in operating the CH, AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE relies upon NXX codes to identify messages
for transmission to participating billing companies. To the extent any sub-processes are required to settle CH
messages due to the use of ported numbers, such sub-processing will be the responsibility of the porting entity.
8.0 CH Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
8.1 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will issue monthly reports containing the results of the processing of CH
Records to each participating LEC and CLEC. These reports list the:
8.1.1 amounts owed by CLEC for billing messages originated by others;
8.1.2 amounts due to CLEC for CLEC originated messages billed by others;
8.1.3 applicable billing charges; and
8.1.4 processing charges.
9.0 Limitation of Liability
9.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Limitation of Liability will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions of
this Agreement.

revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable
to it for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports
or performing any other act under this Attachment.
9.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable for any losses or damages arising out of errors,
interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those
arising from associated equipment and data processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole
negligence of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE is held liable under this Attachment for CH will in no event exceed the amount of processing
charges incurred by CLEC for the services provided hereunder during the period beginning at the time AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE receives notice of the error, interruption, defect, failure or malfunction, to the time
service is restored.
9.4 CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE harmless against and with respect to
any and all Third Party claims, demands, liabilities or court actions arising from any of its actions, omissions,
mistakes or negligence occurring during the course of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE’s performance

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions under which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will perform the revenue settlement of LEC-carried intrastate/intraLATA or
interstate/intraLATA local/toll alternately billed calls between each of the aforementioned regions and the CLEC via
the Centralized Message Distribution System (CMDS) Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS) reports.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS)” means a revenue settlement process for messages which originate from
CLEC and bill to AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and messages
which originate from AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and bill to
CLEC. NICS messages must originate and bill within the same AT&T-Owned ILEC across the fourteen (14)
individual states which make up these two regions.
2.2 “Non-Intercompany Settlements System” or “NICS System” means the national system administered by Telcordia
that is used in the settlement of revenues for calls that are originated and billed by two (2) different Local Exchange
Carriers (LECs) within a single CMDS Direct Participant’s territory to another for billing. NICS applies to calls
involving another LEC where the Earning Company and the Billing Company are located within both AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 NICS shall apply only to alternately billed messages (calling card, third number billed and collect calls) originated by
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE billed by CLEC (when the CLEC is
using its own End Office Switch),or messages originated by CLEC and billed by AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE
and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE within the same AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE State (i.e., messages for intrastate/intraLATA traffic only).
3.1.1 For example, an alternately billed call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS territory and billed to a CLEC within
AT&T-ILLINOIS would be covered by this section; a call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS but billing
outside of AT&T-ILLINOIS would not be covered by NICS.
3.2 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also collect the revenue earned by CLEC within the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE territory from another LEC also within the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE where the
messages are billed, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing Schedule, on behalf of
CLEC. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will remit the revenue billed by CLEC within region to the LEC also
within region, where the messages originated, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing
Schedule. These two amounts will be netted together by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and the resulting
charge or credit issued to CLEC via a monthly invoice in arrears.
3.3 NICS does not extend to 900 or 976 calls or to other pay per call services.
3.4 The Telcordia Technologies NICS report is the source for revenue to be settled between AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and CLEC. NICS settlement will be incorporated into the CLEC's
monthly invoice.
3.5 This Attachment does not cover calls originating and billing within a state outside of AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.6 NICS does not include any interLATA and/or intraLATA long distance charges assessed by an Interexchange Carrier
(IXC).
3.7 The Party billing the End User shall be responsible for all uncollectible amounts.
3.8 Net payment shall be due within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the invoice.

4.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
4.1 Each Party is responsible for submitting the appropriate Exchange Message Interface (EMI) End User billable record
(as defined in the Telcordia Technologies NICS System Specifications document) to Telcordia CMDS for inclusion in
the NICS report when an alternately billed call originates from its End User.
5.0 Limitation of Liability
5.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Limitation of Liability will be governed by the General Terms & Conditions of
this Agreement:
5.1.1 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE assume no liability for
any LEC’s or CLEC’s receipt of appropriate revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable to it
for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports or performing any other act under this
Attachment.
5.1.2 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable for
any losses or damages arising out of errors, interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services
provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those arising from associated equipment and data
processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole negligence of AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is held liable under this
Attachment will in no event exceed the amount that CLEC would have billed AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE per CLEC’s existing tariff for the services provided
hereunder during the period beginning at the time AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE receives notice of the error, interruption, failure or malfunction, to the time
service is restored.
5.1.3 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&TSOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE assumes no
responsibility with regard to the correctness of the data supplied by CLEC when this data is accessed and
used by a Third Party.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC a Daily Usage File (DUF) for services provided
hereunder. A DUF will be provided by AT&T-21STATE in accordance with Exchange Message Interface (EMI)
guidelines supported by the Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF). Any exceptions to the supported formats will be
noted in the DUF implementation requirements documentation. The DUF will include (i) specific daily usage,
including both Section 251(b)(5) Traffic (if and where applicable) and LEC-carried IntraLATA Toll Traffic, in EMI
format for usage sensitive services furnished in connection with each service to the extent that similar usage
sensitive information is provided to retail End Users of AT&T-21STATE within that state, (ii) with sufficient detail to
enable CLEC to bill its End Users for usage sensitive services furnished by AT&T-21STATE in connection with
service provided by AT&T-21STATE, and (iii) operator handled calls provided by AT&T-21STATE. Procedures and
processes for implementing the interfaces with AT&T-21STATE will be included in implementation requirements
documentation.
2.0 General Provisions
2.1 Where available, DUF may be requested on flat-rated Resale lines as well as measured-rated Resale lines. DUF
provided in this instance is labeled as Enhanced DUF (EDUF). In order to receive EDUF on flat-rated Resale lines,
CLEC must also request and receive DUF on its measure-rated Resale lines.
2.2 File transmission for DUF is requested by each unique State and OCN combination. CLEC must provide to AT&T-
21STATE a separate written request for each unique State and OCN combination no less than sixty (60) calendar
days prior to the desired first transmission date for each file.
2.3 AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC for DUF in accordance with the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule
under “Electronic Billing Information Data (Daily Usage) per message”, “Provision of Message Detail a.k.a. Daily
Usage File (DUF), “FB-CLEC Operator Recording (Daily Usage) per message”, and “Daily Usage File (DUF) Data
Transmission, per Message.“ There will be individual rates listed for DUF provided for measure-rated Resale lines
and for EDUF provided on flat-rated Resale lines.
2.4 Call detail for LEC-carried calls that are alternately billed to CLEC End Users’ lines provided by AT&T-21STATE
through Resale will be forwarded to CLEC as rated call detail on the DUF.
2.5 Interexchange call detail on Resale Services that is forwarded to AT&T-21STATE for billing, which would otherwise
be processed by AT&T-21STATE for its retail End Users, will be returned to the IXC and will not be passed through
to CLEC. This call detail will be returned to the IXC with a transaction code indicating that the returned call originated
from a resold account. Billing for Information Services and other ancillary services traffic on Resale Services will be
passed through when AT&T-21STATE records the message.
2.6 Where CLEC is operating its own switch-based service and has contracted with AT&T-21STATE to provide operator
services, upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC a DUF for operator handled calls
handled by AT&T-21STATE.

pursuant to 47 USC 251(c)(6) without the need for a specific request by the CLEC that such new
rates be implemented for each such Collocation arrangement. Adoption of a new rate structure
shall not by itself require purchaser to incur any new non-recurring Collocation area modification or
application charges. In the event that any order for any 251(c)(6) Collocation submitted by
Collocator is pending as of the Effective Date of the Agreement, any NRCs then due and owing or
otherwise then contemplated by such pending order shall be assessed in accordance with the

activities (including power additions or modifications) in the general area of the Collocator’s Dedicated
Space with potential to disrupt the Collocator’s services. AT&T-21STATE will provide such notification to
the Collocator at least twenty (20) Business Days before the scheduled start date of such major construction
activity. AT&T-21STATE will inform the Collocator as soon as practicable by telephone of all emergency-
related activities that AT&T-21STATE or its subcontractors are performing in the general area of the
Collocator’s Dedicated Space, or in the general area of the AC and DC power plants which support the
Collocator’s equipment. If possible, notification of any emergency-related activity will be made immediately
prior to the start of the activity so that the Collocator may take reasonable actions necessary to protect the
Collocator’s Dedicated Space.
3.31 Eligible Structure List:
3.31.1 AT&T-21STATE shall maintain publicly available documents on AT&T CLEC Online website, indicating its
Eligible Structures, if any, that have no space available for Physical Collocation. AT&T-21STATE will
update this document within ten (10) calendar days of the date at which an Eligible Structure runs out of
such Collocation space.
3.31.2 AT&T-21STATE will remove obsolete unused equipment from its Eligible Structures that have no space
available for Collocation upon reasonable request by a Collocator or upon order of the Commission. AT&T-
21STATE shall reserve space for switching, MDF and Digital Cross Connect System (DCS) to

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
3.32.1 Before AT&T-21STATE may make a determination that space in an Eligible Structure is Legitimately
Exhausted, AT&T-21STATE must have removed all unused obsolete equipment from the Eligible Structure,
if requested by CLEC or required by the Commission, and made such space available for Collocation.
Removal of unused obsolete equipment shall not cause a delay in AT&T-21STATE’s response to a
Collocator’s application or in provisioning Collocation arrangements. AT&T-21STATE may reserve space
for transport equipment for the current year plus two (2) years. Additionally, AT&T-21STATE may not
reserve space for equipment for itself, or advanced or interLATA services Affiliates or other Affiliates of
AT&T-21STATE or for future use by AT&T-21STATE or its Affiliates under conditions that are more
favorable than those that apply to other Telecommunications Carriers seeking to reserve Collocation space
for their own use. AT&T-21STATE may reserve space for switching, power, MDF, and DCS up to
anticipated customer growth except as may be restricted in the AT&T CLEC Online Handbook. Additional
information is available in the AT&T CLEC Online Handbook.
3.33 AT&T-21STATE’s Right of Access:

installation, operation, or maintenance , or resulting from the actions or inaction, willful, or negligent, of the CLEC’s
employees, suppliers, or contractors.
4.5 Force Majeure Events shall be governed by the GT&Cs of this Agreement.
4.6 Insurance:
4.6.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Insurance will be governed by the GT&Cs of this Agreement with the
liability limits therein specific to Collocation.
4.6.2 A certificate of insurance stating the types of insurance and policy limits provided the Collocator must be
received prior to commencement of any work. If a certificate is not received, AT&T-21STATE will notify the
Collocator, and the Collocator will have five (5) Business Days to cure the deficiency. If the Collocator does
not cure the deficiency within five (5) Business Days, Collocator hereby authorizes AT&T-21STATE, and
AT&T-21STATE may, but is not required to, obtain insurance on behalf of the Collocator as specified
herein. AT&T-21STATE will invoice Collocator for the costs incurred to so acquire insurance.
4.6.3 The Collocator shall also require all AT&T-21STATE AIS who may enter the Eligible Structure for the
performance of work on their behalf to maintain the same insurance requirements.
4.7 Self-Insured:
4.7.1 Self-insurance in lieu of the insurance requirements listed preceding Section 4.6 above shall be permitted if
the Collocator 1) has a tangible net worth of fifty (50) million dollars or greater, and 2) files a financial
statement annually with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or having a financial strength rating
of 4A or 5A assigned by Dun & Bradstreet. The ability to self-insure shall continue so long as the Collocator
meets all of the requirements of this Section. If the Collocator subsequently no longer satisfies this Section,
the coverage requirements in the GT&Cs Insurance Section will immediately apply.
4.8 Indemnification of AT&T-21STATE:
4.8.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Indemnification is governed by the GT&Cs of this Agreement.
4.9 Casualty Loss:
4.9.1 Damage to Collocation Space:
4.9.1.1 If the Collocation Space is damaged by fire or other casualty that is not the result of the
Collocator’s or Collocator’s AT&T-21STATE AIS actions or those of a Third Party as hereinafter
described, and (1) the Collocation Space is not rendered untenantable in whole or in part, AT&T-
21STATE shall repair the same at its expense and the monthly charge shall not be abated, or (2)
the Collocation Space is rendered untenable in whole or in part and such damage or destruction
can be repaired within ninety (90) Business Days, AT&T-21STATE has the option to repair the
Collocation Space at its expense and the monthly charges shall be proportionately abated while
the Collocator was deprived of the use. If the Collocation Space cannot be repaired within ninety
(90) Business Days, or AT&T-21STATE opts not to rebuild, then AT&T-21STATE shall notify the
Collocator within thirty (30) Business Days following such occurrence that the Collocator’s use of
the Collocation Space will terminate as of the date of such damage. Upon the Collocator’s
election, subject to space availability and technical feasibility, AT&T-21STATE must provide to
the Collocator, a comparable substitute Collocation arrangement at another mutually agreeable
location at the applicable non-recurring charges for that arrangement and location.
4.9.1.2 Any obligation on the part of AT&T-21STATE to repair the Dedicated Space shall be limited to
repairing, restoring and rebuilding the Dedicated Space as prepared for the Collocator by AT&T-
21STATE.
4.10 Damage to Eligible Structure:
4.10.1 Notwithstanding that the Collocator’s Collocation Space may be unaffected thereby, in the event that the
Eligible Structure in which the Collocation Space is located shall be so damaged by fire or other casualty
that closing, demolition or substantial alteration or reconstruction of the Eligible Structure shall, in AT&T-
21STATE’s opinion be advisable, AT&T-21STATE, at its option, may terminate services provided via this

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE
Page 17 of 34
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
Attachment. AT&T-21STATE shall provide the Collocator ten (10) Business Days prior written notice of
termination within thirty (30) Business Days following the date of such occurrence, if possible.
4.11 Security:
4.11.1 AT&T-21STATE may impose the following reasonable security measures on Collocator to assist in
protecting its network and equipment from harm. AT&T-21STATE may use security measures expressly
allowed by the FCC. In addition, AT&T-21STATE may impose security arrangements as stringent as the
security arrangements AT&T-21STATE maintains at its own Eligible Structures either for its own employees
or for authorized contractors. To the extent security arrangements are more stringent for one group than the
other, AT&T-21STATE may impose the more stringent requirements. AT&T-21STATE will not impose
discriminatory security requirements that result in increased Collocation costs without the concomitant
benefit of providing necessary protection of AT&T-21STATE’s equipment. Neither Party will use any
information collected in the course of implementing or operating security arrangements for any marketing or
other purpose in aid of competing with the other Party.
4.11.2 Collocator will conduct background checks of its employee and/or the AT&T-21STATE AIS who will have
access to the Collocation space. Such background checks will include but are not to be limited to criminal
background checks for offenses involving theft or damage to property, and a check of FBI listings of known
or suspected terrorists.
4.11.3 Collocator shall provide its employees and/or the AT&T-21STATE AIS with picture identification, which must
be worn and visible at all times while in Collocator’s Collocation space or other areas in or around the
AT&T-21STATE Premises. The photo identification card shall bear, at a minimum, the employee’s name
and photo and Collocator’s name. AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to remove from an AT&T-21STATE
Premise any employee of Collocator not possessing identification issued by Collocator or who has violated
any of AT&T-21STATE’s policies as outlined in the CLEC Security Training documents.
4.11.3.1 Collocator technicians will be security-qualified by the Collocator and will be required to be
knowledgeable of AT&T-21STATE’s security standards. Collocator personnel and technicians
will undergo the same level of security training or its equivalent that AT&T-21STATE’s own
employees and authorized contractors must undergo. AT&T-21STATE will not, however,
require Collocator to receive security training from AT&T-21STATE, but will provide information
to Collocator on the specific type of training required. Collocator can then provide its employees
with its own security training.
4.11.3.2 Collocator and AT&T-21STATE will each establish disciplinary procedures up to and including
dismissal or denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other property of AT&T-21STATE for
certain specified actions that damage, or place the equipment, facilities, or the network or
personnel of the Collocator or AT&T-21STATE in jeopardy. The following are actions that could
damage or place the Eligible Structure, or the network or the personnel of the Collocator or
AT&T-21STATE in jeopardy and may justify disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or
the denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other AT&T-21STATE property:
4.11.3.2.1 Theft or destruction of AT&T-21STATE’s or Collocator’s property;
4.11.3.2.2 Use/sale or attempted use/sale of alcohol or illegal drugs on AT&T-21STATE
property;
4.11.3.2.3 Threats or violent acts against other persons on AT&T-21STATE property;
4.11.3.2.4 Knowing violations of any local, state or federal law or the requirements of this
Agreement on AT&T-21STATE property;
4.11.3.2.5 Permitting unauthorized persons access to AT&T-21STATE or Collocator’s
equipment on AT&T-21STATE property; and
4.11.3.2.6 Carrying a weapon on AT&T-21STATE property.
4.11.3.3 In addition, AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to interview Collocator’s employees, agents,
suppliers, or Guests in the event of wrongdoing in or around an AT&T-21STATE Premises or

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE
Page 18 of 34
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
involving AT&T-21STATE’s or another Collocated Telecommunications Carrier’s property or
personnel, provided that AT&T-21STATE shall provide reasonable notice to Collocator’s
Security representative of such interview. Collocator and its employees, agents, suppliers, or
Guests shall reasonably cooperate with AT&T-21STATE’s investigation into allegations of
wrongdoing or criminal conduct committed by, witnessed by, or involving Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests. Additionally, AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to bill
Collocator for all reasonable costs associated with investigations involving its employees,
agents, suppliers, or Guests if it is established and mutually agreed in good faith that Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests are responsible for the alleged act(s). Collocator and
AT&T-21STATE will take appropriate disciplinary steps as determined by each Party to address
any violations reported by AT&T-21STATE or the Collocator.
4.11.3.4 AT&T-21STATE may use reasonable security measures to protect its equipment. In the event
AT&T-21STATE elects to erect an interior security partition in a given Eligible Structure to
separate its equipment, AT&T-21STATE may recover the costs of the partition in lieu of the
costs of other reasonable security measures if the partition costs are lower than the costs of any
other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. In no event shall a Collocator be
required to pay for both an interior security partition to separate AT&T-21STATE’s equipment in
an Eligible Structure and any other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. If
AT&T-21STATE elects to erect an interior security partition and recover the cost, it must
demonstrate to the Physical Collocator that other reasonable security methods cost more than
an interior security partition around AT&T-21STATE’s equipment at the time the price quote is
given.
4.11.3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own
equipment shall not interfere with a CLEC’s access to its equipment, including
equipment Collocated directly adjacent to AT&T-21STATE’s equipment. AT&T-
21STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own equipment
shall not impede a Telecommunications Carrier’s ability to Collocate within AT&T-
21STATE’s space. To the extent that AT&T-21STATE is required to install
additional security measures within its interior security partition because a CLEC
has access to its own equipment within the area, such security measures shall be
constructed and maintained at AT&T-21STATE’s expense.
4.11.3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE’s enclosure of its own equipment will not unreasonably increase a
CLEC’s cost nor shall it result in duplicative security costs. The cost of an interior
security partition around AT&T-21STATE’s equipment cannot include any
embedded costs of any other security measures for the Eligible Structure.
5.0 Collocation Space
5.1 Use of Collocation Space:
5.1.1 Nature of Use – Equipment Permitted to be Collocated
5.1.1.1 Equipment is considered necessary for Interconnection if an inability to deploy that equipment
would, as a practical, economic, or operations matter, preclude the Collocator from obtaining
Interconnection with AT&T-21STATE at a level equal in quality to that which AT&T-21STATE
obtains within its own network or AT&T-21STATE provides to an Affiliate, subsidiary, or other
Party.
5.1.1.2 Equipment is considered necessary for access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if an inability to deploy that
equipment would, as a practical, economic, or operational matter, preclude the Collocator from
obtaining non-discriminatory access to that 251(c)(3) UNE.
5.1.1.3 Examples of equipment that would not be considered necessary include, but are not limited to:
traditional circuit switching equipment, equipment used exclusively for call-related databases,
computer servers used exclusively for providing information services, OSS equipment used to
support collocated Telecommunications carrier network operations, equipment that generates

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
customer orders, manages trouble tickets or inventory, or stores customer records in centralized
databases, etc.
5.1.1.4 AT&T-21STATE will determine upon receipt of an application if the requested equipment is
necessary based on the criteria established by the FCC. In order to make this determination,
AT&T-21STATE may need to request additional information from Collocator. Collocator agrees
to use its best efforts to provide such information to AT&T-21STATE in a timely manner.
5.1.2 Multi-functional equipment shall be deemed necessary for Interconnection or access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if,
and only if, the primary purpose and function of the equipment (as the Collocator seeks to deploy it) meets
either or both of the standards set forth above in this Section. For a piece of multi-functional equipment to
be utilized primarily to obtain equal in quality Interconnection or non-discriminatory access to one (1) or
more 251(c)(3) UNEs, there also must be a logical connection or link between the additional functions the
equipment would perform and the Telecommunication Services the Collocator seeks to provide to its End
Users by means of the interconnection or 251(c)(3) UNE. The additional functions of the equipment that, as
stand-alone functions, do not meet either of the standards set forth above in this Section must not cause the
equipment to significantly increase the burden of AT&T-21STATE’s property.
5.2 Demarcation Point - AT&T-21STATE
5.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will designate the point(s) of demarcation between Collocator’s equipment and/or network
facilities and AT&T-21STATE’s network facilities. For DS0, DS1, DS3 and fiber terminations, AT&T-
21STATE shall designate, provide and install demarcation point hardware on a per arrangement basis.
Collocator shall utilize an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 to installing their interconnection cabling to the AT&T-
21STATE designated demarcation point.
5.2.2 The Physical Collocator or its AT&T-21STATE AIS, must install, maintain and operate the
equipment/facilities on its side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be
required within its own Collocation Space to activate service requests.
5.2.3 The Virtual Collocator via its AT&T-21STATE AIS must install and operate the equipment/facilities on its
side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be required within its own
Collocation Space to activate service requests. AT&T-21STATE will maintain the Virtual Collocation
arrangement.
5.3 Types of Available Physical Collocation Arrangements:
5.3.1 AT&T-21STATE will make each of the arrangements outlined below available within its Eligible Structures in
accordance with this Attachment and the AT&T CLEC Online Collocation Handbook so that Collocator will
have a variety of Collocation options from which to choose.
5.3.2 Caged Physical Collocation:
5.3.2.1 Caged Collocation option provides the Physical Collocator with an individual enclosure (not
including a top). This enclosure is an area designated by AT&T-21STATE within an Eligible
Structure to be used by the Physical Collocator for the sole purpose of installing, maintaining and
operating the Physical Collocator-provided equipment for the purpose of Interconnection under
Section 251(c)(2) and access to 251(c)(3) UNEs. Accordingly, AT&T-21STATE will not provide
the Physical Collocator with direct access to AT&T-21STATE’s MDF, with the exception of the
AT&T-21STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.3.2.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide floor space, floor space site conditioning, cage common systems
materials, cage preparation, and safety and security charges in increments of one (1) square
foot. For this reason, the Physical Collocator will be able to order space and a cage enclosure in
amounts as small as that sufficient to house and maintain a single rack or bay of equipment
(minimum of fifty (50) square feet of caged space) and will ensure that the first Physical
Collocator in an AT&T-21STATE Premises will not be responsible for the entire cost of site
preparation and security.

5.3.2.3 At the Physical Collocator’s option, the Collocator may elect to install its own enclosure, but must
comply with all methods, procedures and guidelines followed by AT&T-21STATE in constructing
such an arrangement. The Physical Collocator may provide a cage enclosure (which shall not
include a top), cable rack and support structure inside the cage, lighting, receptacles, cage
grounding, cage sign and door key set. In addition, terms and conditions for contractors
performing cage construction activities as set forth following will apply.
5.3.3 Shared Caged Collocation:
5.3.3.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide Shared Caged Collocation as set forth in the AT&T CLEC Online
Handbook. Two (2) or more Physical Collocators may initially apply at the same time to share a
Caged Collocation space as set forth in 2.0 above. Charges to each Physical Collocator will be
based upon the percentage of total space utilized by each Physical Collocator.
5.3.4 Guest-Host Collocation (Also known as Sub-Lease Collocation):
5.3.4.1 The Physical Collocator may allow other Telecommunications Carriers to share the Physical
Collocator’s caged Collocation space, pursuant to the terms and conditions agreed to by the
Physical Collocator (Host) and the other Telecommunication Carriers (Guests) which must be
consistent with the provisions contained in this Section and this Agreement, except where the
AT&T-21STATE Premises is located within a leased space and AT&T-21STATE is prohibited by
said lease from offering such an option to the Physical Collocator. AT&T-21STATE shall be
notified in writing by the Physical Collocator upon the execution of any agreement between the
Host and its Guest(s) prior to the submission of an application. Further, such notification shall
include the name of the Guest(s), the term of the agreement, and a certification by the Physical
Collocator that said agreement imposes upon the Guest(s) the same terms and conditions for
Collocation space as set forth in this Attachment between AT&T-21STATE and the Physical
Collocator. The term of the agreement between the Host and its Guest(s) shall not exceed the
term of this Agreement between AT&T-21STATE and the Physical Collocator.
5.3.4.2 The Physical Collocator, as the Host, shall be the sole interface and the responsible Party to
AT&T-21STATE for the assessment and billing of rates and charges contained within this
Attachment and for the purposes of ensuring that the safety and security requirements of this
Attachment are fully complied with by the Guest(s), the Guest(s) employees and agents. There
will be a minimum charge of one (1) bay/rack per Host/Guest. In addition to the above, the
Physical Collocator shall be the responsible Party to AT&T-21STATE for the purpose of
submitting applications for initial and additional equipment placement for the Guest(s).
5.3.4.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guest(s) may submit service orders to AT&T-21STATE to
request the provisioning of interconnecting facilities between AT&T-21STATE and the Guest(s),
the provisioning of services, and/or access to Section 251(c)(3) UNEs. The bill for these
interconnecting facilities, services and Section 251(c)(3) UNEs will be charged to the Guest(s)
pursuant to the applicable the Guest’s Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-21STATE.
5.3.5 Cageless Collocation:
5.3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide cageless Collocation in any Collocation space that is supported by
the existing Telecommunications infrastructure. AT&T-21STATE will provide space in single bay
increments, including available space adjacent to or next to AT&T-21STATE’s equipment as
needed.
5.3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall allow the Physical Collocator to collocate the Physical Collocator’s
equipment and facilities without requiring the construction of a cage or similar structure.
5.3.5.3 Except where the Physical Collocator’s equipment requires special technical considerations
(e.g., special cable racking or isolated ground plane), AT&T-21STATE shall assign cageless
Collocation arrangement in conventional equipment rack lineups where feasible. For equipment
requiring special technical considerations, the Physical Collocator must provide the equipment

contained in TP-76200, and shall be responsible for compliance with all special technical
requirements associated with such equipment.
5.4 Adjacent On-Site Collocation:
5.4.1 Where Physical Collocation space within the AT&T-21STATE CO is Legitimately Exhausted AT&T-
21STATE will permit the Physical Collocator to Physically Collocate on AT&T-21STATE’s property in the
Physical Collocator’s adjacent structures similar to structures that AT&T-21STATE uses to house
Telecommunication Equipment, to the extent Technically Feasible.
5.4.2 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC will mutually agree on the location of the designated space on AT&T-21STATE
premises where the Adjacent Structure will be placed. AT&T-21STATE will not unreasonably withhold
agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator. Safety and maintenance requirements, zoning,
future building expansion and other state and local regulations are all examples of reasonable grounds to
withhold agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator.
5.4.3 AT&T-21STATE will offer the following increments of power to the Adjacent Structure:
5.4.3.1 a standard offering of one hundred (100) amps of AC power to the Adjacent Structure when CO
Switchboard AC capacity exists; or
5.4.3.2 DC power within two (2) cable options that allow increments of 2-100 (100A feed and 100B feed)
Amp Power Feeds, 2-200 (200A feed and 200B feed) Amp Power Feeds, 2-300 (300A feed and
300B feed) Amp Power Feeds, and 2-400 (400A feed and 400B feed) Amp Power Feeds to the
Adjacent Structure from the CO Power source.
5.4.4 At its option, the Physical Collocator may choose to provide its own AC and DC power to the Adjacent
Structure.
5.4.5 AT&T-21STATE will provide Physical Collocation services to such Adjacent Structures, subject to the same
requirements as other Collocation arrangements in this Attachment.
5.4.6 AT&T-21STATE shall permit the Physical Collocator to place its own equipment, including, but not limited
to, copper cables, coaxial cables, fiber cables and Telecommunications Equipment, in adjacent facilities
constructed by the Physical Collocator’s AT&T-21STATE AIS. Accordingly, AT&T-21STATE will not
provide the Physical Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-21STATE’s MDF, with the
exception of the AT&T-21STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.4.7 The Physical Collocator shall be responsible for securing all required licenses and permits, the required site
preparations and shall further retain responsibility for securing and/or constructing the Adjacent Structure
and any building and site maintenance associated with the placement of such Adjacent Structure.
5.4.8 Regeneration is required for Collocation in an Adjacent Structure if the cabling distance between the
Physical Collocator’s POT bay or termination point located in an Adjacent Structure and AT&T-21STATE’s
cross-connect bay exceeds American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) limitations. Regeneration is
not required in any other circumstances except where the Physical Collocator specifically requests
regeneration. Required regeneration and Physical Collocator requested regeneration will be provided at the
Physical Collocator’s expense.
5.4.9 In the event that interior space in an Eligible Structure becomes available, AT&T-21STATE will provide the
option to the Physical Collocator to relocate its equipment from an Adjacent on-site facility into the interior
space. In the event the Physical Collocator chooses to relocate its equipment into the interior space,
appropriate charges applicable for Collocation within the Eligible Structure will apply.
5.4.10 If a Physical Collocator elects to provide an Adjacent On-Site Space Collocation as described above, when
all available space for Physical Collocation is Legitimately Exhausted inside an AT&T-21STATE Eligible
Structure, AT&T-21STATE will charge Planning Fees to recover the costs incurred to estimate the quotation
of charges for the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site Collocation arrangement request. Rates and charges are
found in the Pricing Schedule. In addition, should the Collocator elect to have AT&T-21STATE provision an
extension of DC Power Service from the Eligible Structure to the Adjacent Structure, a Collocator
Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) will be required.

5.4.11 Adjacent On-site Planning Fee:
5.4.11.1 An initial Planning Fee will apply when a Collocator is requesting any Interconnection
Terminations between the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure and AT&T-21STATE on an
initial or subsequent Adjacent On-site collocation application. This fee recovers the design route
of the Interconnection Terminations as well as the design route of the power arrangement to the
Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure.
5.5 Virtual Collocation:
5.5.1 Virtual Collocation for the purpose of Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) to AT&T-21STATE or access
to AT&T-21STATE provided 251(c)(3) UNEs is ordered as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s Interconnector’s
Collocation Services Handbook for Virtual Collocation. AT&T-21STATE will designate the location or
locations within its wire centers, CEVs, huts and cabinets for the placement of all equipment and facilities
associated with Virtual Collocation. Virtual Collocation does not involve the reservation of segregated CO or
CEV, hut and Cabinet space for the use of Virtual Collocator. AT&T-21STATE will provide Virtual
Collocation for the Virtual Collocator’s comparable equipment as it provides to itself in the CO, wire center,
CEV, hut or Cabinet, as the case may be, subject to the requirements of this Agreement.
6.0 Reports
6.1 Space Availability Report:
6.1.1 CLEC may request a space availability report prior to its application for Collocation space within AT&T-
21STATE’s Eligible Structures. This report will specify the amount of Collocation space available at each
requested Eligible Structure, the number of Collocators, and any modifications in the use of the space since
the last report. The report will also include measures that AT&T-21STATE is taking to make additional
space available for Collocation. CLEC may access the appropriate form for the space availability report on
the AT&T CLEC Online website. A space availability report does not reserve space at the AT&T-21STATE
Premises for which the space availability report was requested by CLEC.
6.1.2 Fees for such reports are shown in the Pricing Schedule.
7.0 Application Process
7.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide Collocation arrangements in Eligible Structures on a “first-come, first-served” basis. To
apply for a Dedicated Space in a particular Eligible Structure CLEC and AT&T-21STATE will follow the Collocation
Application (“Application”) process in the AT&T-21STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook at the
AT&T CLEC Online website. The Collocator will provide a completed Application through the Collocation Application
Web Portal via AT&T-21STATE’s CLEC Online website and will pay AT&T-21STATE an initial Planning/Application
Fee as found in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.1 Application for Multiple Methods of Collocation:
7.1.1.1 A Collocator wishing AT&T-21STATE to consider multiple methods for Collocation in an Eligible
Structure on a single Application will need to include in each Application a prioritized list of its
preferred methods of collocating, (e.g., caged, cageless, or other, as well as adequate
information), (e.g., specific layout requirements, cage size, number of bays, requirements
relative to adjacent bays, etc.) for AT&T-21STATE to process the Application for each of the
preferred methods. If a Collocator provides adequate information and its preferences with its
Application, AT&T-21STATE would not require an additional Application, nor would the
Collocator be required to restart the quotation interval should its first choice not be available in
an Eligible Structure.
7.2 Complete and Accurate Application Review Process:
7.2.1 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and initial Planning/Application Fee
payment, AT&T-21STATE will begin development of the quotation.
7.2.2 In responding to an Application request, if space and interconnection facilities are available and all other
Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-21STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request for space is

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
granted, confirm the applicable NRC and MRC rates and the estimated provisioning interval. AT&T-
21STATE will not select for Collocator the type of Collocation to be ordered.
7.2.3 All applicable NRCs are required to be paid to AT&T-21STATE prior to the Collocation space being turned
over to the Collocator. AT&T-12STATE processes the payment of the aforementioned NRCs in two
installments: Fifty percent (50%) of the applicable NRCs are due upon the Collocator’s deliverance of the
signed BFFO to AT&T-12STATE with the remaining fifty percent (50%) payment due two (2) weeks prior to
the Collocation space turnover. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will issue a bill for all applicable
NRCs to the Collocator’s after the Collocator’s deliverance of the signed BFFO.
7.3 Space Unavailability Determination and Resolution:
7.3.1 In responding to an Application request if space is not available, AT&T-21STATE will notify the Collocator
that its application for Collocation Space is denied due to the lack of space and no Application fee shall
apply. If AT&T-21STATE knows when additional Collocation space may become available at the AT&T-
21STATE CO requested by Collocator such information will be provided to Collocator in AT&T-21STATE’s
written denial of Collocation Space. AT&T-21STATE in its denial will provide the Collocator with any other
known methods of Collocation that may be available within the Eligible Structure that the Collocator’s
Application addressed. If the Collocator determines the alternative method of collocation meets their needs,
the Collocator will be required to submit a new collocation application and pay the initial Planning Fee.
7.3.2 The notification will include a possible future space relief date, if applicable. At that time, any non-recurring
charges collected with the Application, including the Planning Fee, will be returned to the Collocator. When
AT&T-21STATE’s response includes an amount of space less than that requested by Collocator or space
that is configured differently, no Application fee will apply. If Collocator decides to accept the available
space, Collocator must resubmit its Application to reflect the actual space available including the
reconfiguration of the space. When Collocator resubmits its Application to accept the available space,
AT&T-21STATE will bill the applicable Application/Planning fee.
7.3.3 In the event of a denial, AT&T-21STATE will file a notice that the Collocator’s request was denied with the
Commission. When contested in support of its denial, AT&T-21STATE will concurrently submit to both the
Commission and the Collocator, provided under seal and subject to proprietary protections, the following
when applicable:
7.3.3.1 central office common language location identifier (CLLI);
7.3.3.2 the identity of the requesting Collocator;
7.3.3.3 amount of space requested by the Collocator;
7.3.3.4 the total amount of space at the AT&T-21STATE premises;
7.3.3.5 floor plan documentation (as provided for in the Space Availability Determination section of the
Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook);
7.3.3.6 identification of switch turnaround plans and other equipment removal plans and timelines; if any,
7.3.3.7 CO rearrangement/expansion plans; if any,
7.3.3.8 and description of other plans, if any, that may relieve space exhaustion.
7.3.4 In the event AT&T-21STATE denies a Collocator’s request and the Collocator disputes the denial, the
Collocator may request a tour of the Eligible Structure to verify space availability or the lack thereof. The
request shall be submitted to AT&T-21STATE’s designated representative in writing. Time limits
established by the FCC must be respected. The inspection tour shall be scheduled as mutually agreeable.
7.3.5 Prior to the inspection tour, a “Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement” shall be signed by the designated
AT&T-21STATE representative and the representative the Collocator, who will participate in the tour.
7.3.6 AT&T-21STATE will provide all relevant documentation to the Collocator including blueprints and plans for
future facility expansions or enhancements, subject to executing the Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement.
AT&T-21STATE’s representative will accompany and supervise the Collocator agent on the inspection tour.

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
7.3.7 If the Collocator believes, based on the inspection tour of the Eligible Structure facilities, that the denial of
Physical Collocation space is unsupportable, the Collocator agent shall promptly so advise AT&T-
21STATE. The Collocator and AT&T-21STATE shall then each concurrently prepare a report detailing its
own findings of the inspection tour. The Collocator and AT&T-21STATE reports shall be concurrently
served on each other and submitted to the Commission no later than forty-five (45) calendar days following
the filing of the request for space. The burden of proof shall be on AT&T-21STATE to justify the basis for
any denial of collocation requests.
7.4 Revisions:
7.4.1 If a modification or revision is made to any information in the Application after AT&T-21STATE has provided
the Application response and prior to a BFFO, with the exception of modifications to (1) Customer
Information, (2) Contact Information or (3) Billing Contact Information, whether at the request of Collocator
or as necessitated by technical considerations, the Application shall be considered a new Application and
handled as a new Application with respect to the response and provisioning intervals. AT&T-21STATE will
charge Collocator the appropriate Application/Augment fee associated with the level of assessment
performed by AT&T-21STATE.
7.4.2 Once AT&T-21STATE has provided the BFFO/quote and CLEC has accepted and authorized AT&T-
21STATE to begin construction, any further modifications and/or revisions must be made via a subsequent
Collocation Application and the appropriate fees will apply.
7.5 Augments:
7.5.1 A request from a Collocator to add or modify space, equipment, and/or cable to an existing Collocation
arrangement is considered an Augment. Such a request must be made via a complete and accurate
Application.
7.5.2 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and Planning Fee payment, AT&T-
21STATE will begin development of the Augment quotation. In responding to an Augment request, if power
and/or Interconnection facilities are available and all other Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-
21STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request is granted, confirm the applicable non-recurring and
recurring rates and the estimated provisioning interval.
7.5.3 Several types of Augments are identified in the Collocation Section of the AT&T CLEC Online website.
Those Augments will have associated pricing within the Pricing Schedule. Examples are:
7.5.3.1 100 Copper cable pair connections
7.5.3.2 28 DS1 connections; and/or
7.5.3.3 1 DS3 connections; and/or
7.5.3.4 24 fiber connections
7.6 For all Augments other than provided above, AT&T-21STATE will work cooperatively with Collocator to negotiate a
mutually agreeable delivery interval. All intervals and procedures associated with Augment Applications can be
found in AT&T-21STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook at the AT&T CLEC Online website.
7.7 Intervals for Interconnection & Power Cabling:
7.7.1 CLEC shall consult the AT&T CLEC Online Handbook for information regarding interval changes regarding
Interconnection to and/or Power Cabling changes. CLEC must use an AT&T-21STATE AIS to establish
Interconnection and/or Power cabling as outlined in the appropriate TP.
8.0 Augment Application
8.1 In the event Collocator or the Physical Collocator’s Guest(s) desires to modify its use of the Collocation space in a
CO after a BFFO, Collocator shall complete a new Application that contains all of the detailed information associated
with a requested alteration of the Collocation space. The subsequent Application will be processed by AT&T-
21STATE when it is complete and accurate, meaning that all of the required fields on the Subsequent Application
have been completed with the appropriate type of information associated with the requested alteration. AT&T-

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE
Page 25 of 34
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
21STATE shall determine what modifications, if any, to the AT&T-21STATE Premises are required to accommodate
the change(s) requested by Collocator in the subsequent Application. Such modifications to the AT&T-21STATE
Premises may include, but are not limited to, floor loading changes, changes necessary to meet HVAC requirements,
changes to power plant requirements, equipment additions, etc.
9.0 Cancellation Prior to Due Date
9.1 In the event that the Collocator cancels its Collocation Application after AT&T-21STATE has begun preparation of
the Telecommunications Infrastructure Space and Dedicated Space, but before AT&T-21STATE has been paid the
entire amounts due under this Attachment, then in addition to other remedies that AT&T-21STATE might have, the
Collocator shall be liable in the amount equal to the non-recoverable costs less estimated net salvage, the total of
which is not to exceed the Preparation Charges. Non-recoverable costs include the non-recoverable cost of
equipment and material ordered, provided or used; the non-recoverable cost of installation and removal, including the
costs of equipment and material ordered, provided or used; labor; transportation and any other associated costs.
Upon Collocator’s request, AT&T-21STATE will provide the Collocator with a detailed invoice showing the costs it
incurred associated with preparation.
10.0 Occupancy – Physical Collocation Only
10.1 Unless there are unusual circumstances, AT&T-21STATE will notify the Physical Collocator that the Dedicated
Space is ready for occupancy after AT&T-21STATE’s completion of preparation of the Dedicated Space. All MRCs
and NRCs will begin to accrue on the date that the Collocation space construction had been completed by AT&T-
21STATE (“Space Ready Date”), regardless of any failure by the Physical Collocator to complete its work or occupy
the space.
10.2 After the Physical Collocator’s receipt of such notice, the Physical Collocator shall request within fifteen (15) calendar
days an acceptance walk-through of the Collocation space with AT&T-21STATE. The acceptance walk-through will
be scheduled on a mutually agreed upon date. Any material deviations from mutually agreed Application
specifications may be noted by the Physical Collocator as exceptions, which to qualify as exceptions, must be agreed
to as exceptions by AT&T-21STATE. The agreed upon exceptions shall be corrected by AT&T-21STATE by a
mutually agreed upon date. The correction of these exceptions shall be at AT&T-21STATE’s expense. AT&T-
21STATE will then establish a new Space Ready Date.
10.3 Upon completion of corrections described in Section 10.2, AT&T-21STATE will again notify the Physical Collocator
that the Dedicated Space is ready for occupancy and the Parties will, upon Collocator’s request, conduct a follow-up
acceptance walk-through as set forth in this Section. This follow-up acceptance walkthrough will be limited to only
those corrections identified and agreed to by the Parties in the initial walkthrough, as described in Section 10.2
above. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is not requested by the Physical Collocator within fifteen (15) calendar
days, the Space Ready Date shall be deemed to be the Delivery Date. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is
requested, but no continuing material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date of the follow-up acceptance walk-through. If a follow-up acceptance
walk-through is requested, and material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date upon which the Physical Collocator accepts all corrections to such
exceptions, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.4 All charges to the Physical Collocator will begin to accrue on the Effective Billing Date, regardless of any failure by
Collocator to complete its work or occupy the space. In the case of the termination of this Agreement prior to term, or
the early termination of any Collocation services, AT&T-21STATE shall be entitled to full payment within thirty (30)
calendar days of such expiration or termination for all services performed and expenses accrued or incurred that
AT&T-21STATE is entitled to recover under the provisions of this Attachment for establishing such Collocation
arrangement prior to such expiration or termination.
10.5 If the Physical Collocator cancels or abandons its Collocation space in any of AT&T-21STATE COs before AT&T-
21STATE has recovered the full cost associated with providing that space to the Physical Collocator, the amount of
any such remaining costs shall become immediately due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Physical Collocator abandons that space.

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE
Page 26 of 34
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
10.6 For purposes of this Section, the Collocator’s Telecommunications Equipment is considered to be operational and
Interconnected when it is connected to either AT&T-21STATE’s network or interconnected to another Third Party
Collocator’s equipment that resides within the same structure, provided the Third Party Collocator’s equipment is
used for Interconnection with AT&T-21STATE’s network or to obtain access to AT&T-21STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs.
10.7 Early Space Acceptance:
10.7.1 If Physical Collocator decides to occupy the Collocation space prior to the Space Ready Date, the date
Physical Collocator executes the Agreement for “Customer Access and Acceptance to Unfinished
Collocation Space” is the date that will be deemed the space acceptance date and billing will begin from that
date.
10.7.2 The Physical Collocator will, whenever possible, place its Telecommunications Equipment in the Collocation
space within thirty (30) calendar days of space turnover. Operational Telecommunications Equipment must
be placed in the Dedicated Space and interconnected to AT&T-21STATE’s network pursuant to Section
251(c)(2) or used to obtain access to AT&T-21STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs within one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after receipt of Notice that AT&T-21STATE has completed its work as required by the
complete and accurate Collocation Application.
10.8 Reclamation of Dedicated Space:
10.8.1 If the Physical Collocator fails to place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space
to Interconnect with AT&T-21STATE to obtain access to AT&T-21STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs meeting all the
requirements of Section 5.1 above and 10.7 above and the space is needed to meet customer demand
(filed application for space, accompanied by all fees) for another Collocator or to avoid construction of a
building addition, then AT&T-21STATE has the right to reclaim the Dedicated Space. AT&T-21STATE will
send the Physical Collocator written Notice of its intent to terminate the Physical Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement in the prepared Dedicated Space within ten (10) Business Days after the notice date. If the
Physical Collocator does not place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space and
interconnect with AT&T-21STATE or obtain access to AT&T-21STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs by that tenth (10th)
Business Day then the Collocation is deemed terminated and the Physical Collocator shall be liable in an
amount equal to the unpaid balance of the applicable charges.
10.8.2 If the Physical Collocator causes AT&T-21STATE to prepare the Dedicated Space and then the Physical
Collocator does not use the Dedicated Space (or all of the Dedicated Space), the Physical Collocator will
pay AT&T-21STATE the monthly recurring and other applicable charges as if the Physical Collocator were
using the entire Dedicated Space, until such time as the Physical Collocator submits a complete and
accurate decommissioning Application, and the decommissioning process is completed as required.
11.0 Efficiently Used
11.1 Orders for additional space will not be accepted until the Collocator’s existing Collocation space in the requested
Eligible Structure is Efficiently Used (as defined in Section 2 this Attachment) except to the extent the Collocator
establishes to AT&T-21STATE’s satisfaction that the Collocator’s apparent inefficient use of space is caused by the
CLEC holding Unused Space for future use on the same basis that AT&T-21STATE holds Unused Space for future
use.

the A & B feeds) must be engineered (sized), and installed by Collocator’s AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1, in accordance
with the number of DC amps requested by Collocator on Collocator’s Initial Application or any Subsequent
Applications. Collocator is also responsible for contracting with an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 to run the power

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-21STATE
Page 33 of 34
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
distribution feeder cable from the AT&T-21STATE Power Source to the equipment in Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement. The AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 contracted by Collocator must provide AT&T-21STATE with a copy of
the engineering power specifications prior to the day on which Collocator’s equipment becomes operational
(hereinafter “Commencement Date”). AT&T-21STATE will provide the common power feeder cable support
structure between the AT&T Power Source and Collocator’s Collocation arrangement. Collocator shall contract with
an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 who shall be responsible for performing those power provisioning activities required to
enable Collocator’s equipment to become operational, which may include, but are not limited to, the installation,
removal or replacement of the following: dedicated power cable support structure within Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement, power cable feeds and terminations of the power cabling. Collocator and Collocator’s AT&T-21STATE
AIS Tier 1 shall comply with all applicable NEC, AT&T TP-76300, Telcordia and ANSI Standards that address power
cabling, installation and maintenance.
19.2 AT&T-21STATE will permit Collocator to request DC power in ten (10) amp increments up to one hundred (100)
amps from the AT&T-21STATE Power source.
19.3 Collocator Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) – (Options):
19.3.1 A Collocator Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) with maximum 200 amp capacity may be ordered from
AT&T-21STATE or an equivalent panel provided by the Collocator’s AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1. At least
one (1) DC power panel is required with each application requiring DC Power when designed to provide
between 50 and 200 amps per feed of DC current. However the Collocator may substitute the required
power panel with an equivalent power panel subject to meeting NEBS Level 1 Safety and review by AT&T-
21STATE technical support. See the Collocation Handbook for additional information.
19.4 Eligible Structure Ground Cable Arrangement, Each:
19.4.1 The ground cable arrangement is the cabling arrangement designed to provide grounding for equipment
within the Collocator’s Dedicated Space. Separate Ground Cable Arrangements are required for Integrated
and Isolated Ground Planes. AT&T-21STATE provides an Integrated Ground Plane to serve the
Collocator’s equipment in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE equipment. Requests for an “Isolated”
Ground Plane will be treated on an ICB basis.
19.5 Power Reduction:
19.5.1 The Collocator may request to decrease the amount of existing power available to a Collocation
Arrangement. This can be done either by disconnecting and removing a power cable feed or by replacing
the existing fuse with a fuse of a lower breakdown rating on a power cable feed. If the Collocator desires to
disconnect a power arrangement (A&B feed), the Collocator will be responsible for hiring an AT&T-
21STATE AIS Tier 1 to remove the terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to
the AT&T-21STATE rack level that make up the power arrangement. If the Collocator desires to reduce the
amperage on a power cable feed, the Collocator will be responsible for paying the costs necessary to
change the fuse that serves the A&B feeds at the AT&T-21STATE power source. In either case, the
Collocator must maintain a minimum amount of power on at least one power arrangement (A&B feed) to
service their Collocation Arrangement when submitting their power reduction request. The Collocator shall
submit an augment application in order to process this request.
19.5.2 If the Collocator desires to only reduce the fuse capacity on an existing power arrangement (A&B feed)
rather than disconnect and remove cable to an existing power arrangement, they may only reduce the fuse
size to the lowest power amp increment offered in this Attachment referenced in 19.2 above. Different
minimum amp increments apply for power arrangements fed from either an AT&T-21STATE BDFB or an
AT&T-21STATE power plant. When the Collocator is requesting to reduce the fuse capacity only, the fees
referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply. When the Collocator has only one power arrangement (A&B
feed) serving their Collocation Arrangement, a fuse reduction is the only power reduction option available to
the Collocator.
19.5.3 When a power reduction request involves a fuse change only on a power arrangement serviced from the
AT&T-21STATE BDFB (e.g., power arrangements less than or equal to a fifty (50) amp A feed and a fifty
(50) amp B feed) the Collocator must hire an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 to coordinate fuse changes at the
AT&T-21STATE BDFB. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule will still apply. When a power

reduction request involves a fuse change on a power arrangement serviced from the AT&T-21STATE
Power Plant (e.g., power arrangements consisting of a one hundred (100) amp A feed and a one hundred
(100) amp B feed and above), the Collocator must hire an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 power supplier to
coordinate the fuse changes at the AT&T-21STATE power plant.
19.5.4 When a power reduction request requires disconnecting and removing a power cable feed from either the
AT&T-21STATE’s BDFB (Battery Distribution Fuse Bay) or power plant, the AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 will
perform the power cable removal work up to the rack level. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule
will apply. Within thirty (30) calendar days after submitting its power reduction request to disconnect and
remove a power arrangement, the Collocator must perform the following activity:
19.5.4.1 Remove terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to the AT&T-
21STATE rack level. Collocator must use an AT&T-21STATE AIS Tier 1 for this procedure and
that supplier must follow TP76300 guidelines for cutting and capping the cable at the rack level.
19.6 When the Collocator has multiple power arrangement serving a Collocation Arrangement (e.g., one power
arrangement consisting of fifty (50) amps on the A feed and fifty (50) amps on the B feed and a second power
arrangement consisting of twenty (20) amps on the A feed and twenty (20) amps on the B feed), the Collocator has
the option of either fusing down the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed) or disconnecting and removing the
power cable feed from the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed). If the Collocator chooses to disconnect and
remove the power cable feed from a power arrangement (A&B feed), then the charges referenced in Pricing
Schedule will apply. If the Collocator has multiple power arrangements (A&B feed) where they can request both a
fuse reduction and a power cable removal for one Collocation Arrangement [e.g., reduce one power arrangement
from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to twenty (20) amps (A&B feed) and remove the power cable from a second power
arrangement from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to ten (10) amps (A&B feed)], then the project management fee for
power cable removal referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply in addition to the individual charges referenced in
the Pricing Schedule associated with the overall power reduction request.
19.7 For any power reduction request (one which involves either a disconnect and removal, re-fusing only, or a
combination of the two), the Collocator must submit an augment application for this request along with the
appropriate application and project management fees referenced in the Pricing Schedule. The same Augment
intervals that are outlined in this Attachment for adding power will apply to power reduction requests.
20.0 Collocation in CEVs, Huts and Cabinets
20.1 Remote Terminals - When the requirements of this Agreement are met, collocation will be allowed in Controlled
Environmental Vaults (CEVs), Huts and Cabinets and other AT&T-21STATE owned or controlled premises where
Collocation is practical and Technically Feasible, (e.g., where heat dissipation is not severely limited and there is
sufficient space for Collocator’s equipment).
20.2 AT&T-12STATE will assign space in a RT in two-inch vertical mounting space increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of two-inch vertical mounting spaces required is
determined by the size of the equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and
ventilation of the equipment to be placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates.
20.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also assign space in a RT in single bay increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of bays required is determined by the size of the
equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and ventilation of the equipment to be
placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates and charges.
20.4 AT&T-21STATE: RT Collocation Arrangements - AT&T-21STATE shall make available -48V DC power for
Collocator’s RT Collocation arrangement at an AT&T-21STATE power source within the RT. The charge for power
shall be assessed as part of the MRCs per the Pricing Schedule. If the power requirements for Collocator’s
equipment exceed the capacity available, then such additional power requirements shall be assessed on an
individual case basis.

Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-21STATE will furnish CLEC with
access to Unbundled Network Elements pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Telecommunications Act (herein
referred to as “251(c)(3) UNEs” or “UNEs”) for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act, Section
251(c)(3)) in AT&T-21STATE’s incumbent local Exchange areas.
1.2 Nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute consent by AT&T-21STATE that any item
identified in this Agreement as a UNE or network element is a network element or UNE under Section 251(c)(3) of
the Act, as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and effective FCC and judicial
orders, that AT&T-21STATE is required to provide to CLEC alone, or in combination with other network elements or
UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise), or commingled with other network elements, UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise) or other
services or facilities.
1.3 The preceding includes without limitation that AT&T-21STATE shall not be obligated to provide combinations
(whether considered new, pre-existing or existing) or other arrangements (including, where applicable, Commingled
Arrangements) involving AT&T-21STATE network elements that do not constitute 251(c)(3) UNEs, or where
251(c)(3) UNEs are not requested for permissible purposes.
1.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Amendment to this Agreement, including but not limited
to intervening law, change in law or other substantively similar provision in the Agreement or any Amendment, if an
element described as an Unbundled Network Element or 251(c)(3) UNE in this Agreement is Declassified or is
otherwise no longer a 251(c)(3) UNE, then the Transition Procedure defined in Section 3.5 below, shall govern.
1.5 Access to 251(c)(3) UNEs is provided under this Agreement over such routes, technologies, and facilities as AT&T-
21STATE may elect at its own discretion. AT&T-21STATE will provide access to 251(c)(3) UNEs where technically
feasible. Where facilities and equipment are not available, AT&T-21STATE shall not be required to provide 251(c)(3)
UNEs.
1.6 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC under the provisions of this Attachment shall remain the property of AT&T-
21STATE.
1.7 Subject to the terms herein, AT&T-21STATE is responsible only for the installation, operation and maintenance of
the 251(c)(3) UNEs it provides. AT&T-21STATE is not otherwise responsible for the Telecommunications Services
provided by CLEC through the use of those 251(c)(3) UNEs.
1.8 Where 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC are dedicated to a single End User, if such 251(c)(3) UNEs are for any
reason disconnected they shall be made available to AT&T-21STATE for future provisioning needs, unless such
251(c)(3) UNE is disconnected in error. CLEC agrees to relinquish control of any such 251(c)(3) UNE concurrent
with the disconnection of a its End User’s service.
1.9 The Parties intend that this Attachment contains the sole and exclusive terms and conditions by which CLEC will
obtain UNEs from AT&T-21STATE. Accordingly, except as may be specifically permitted by this Attachment, and
then only to the extent permitted, CLEC and its Affiliates hereby fully and irrevocably waive any right or ability any of
them might have to purchase any UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs (or
otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling or otherwise) directly from any
AT&T-21STATE tariff, to the extent such tariff(s) is/are available, and agree not to so purchase or attempt to so
purchase from any such tariff. Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding
waiver, estoppel, laches, or similar concepts in other situations, the failure of AT&T-21STATE to enforce the
foregoing (including if AT&T-21STATE fails to reject or otherwise block orders for, or provides or continues to
provide, UNEs, or otherwise, under tariff) shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or
other similar concepts shall not act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder. At its option, AT&T-21STATE
may either reject any such order submitted under tariff, or without the need for any further contact with or consent
from CLEC, AT&T-21STATE may process any such order as being submitted under this Attachment and, further,
may convert any element provided under tariff, to this Attachment effective as of the later in time of (i) the Effective
Date of this Agreement, or (ii) the submission of the order by CLEC.

1.10 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another local exchange carrier,
including AT&T-21STATE, AT&T-21STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as network elements or as part of a resold service, and regardless of whether
the End User served with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or
otherwise. AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 AT&T-21STATE Premise(s) means as defined in Attachment 12 – Collocation.
2.2 “Building” or “same building” means a structure under one (1) roof or two (2) or more structures on one (1) premises
which are connected by an enclosed or covered passageway.
2.3 “Commingling” or “Commingled Arrangement” means an arrangement connecting, attaching, or otherwise linking of a
UNE, or a combination of UNEs, to one (1) or more facilities or services that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from
AT&T-21STATE, or the combining of a UNE, or a combination of UNEs, with one (1) or more such facilities or
services. Commingling in its entirety (the ability of CLEC to Commingle, AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to perform the
functions necessary to Commingle, and Commingled Arrangements) shall not apply to or otherwise include, involve
or encompass AT&T-21STATE offerings pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 271 that are not 251(c)(3) UNEs under 47 U.S.C. §
251(c)(3).
2.4 “Declassified UNE” or “Declassified” means a UNE that ceases to be a UNE under this Agreement because it is no
longer required by Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated
251(c)(3) and effective FCC and judicial orders.
2.5 “Demarcation Point” means the point on the loop where AT&T-21STATE’s control of the wire ceases and the End
User’s control (or in the case of some multi-unit premises, the landlord’s control) of the wire begins.
2.6 “Enhanced Extended Link (EEL)” means a 251(c)(3) UNE combination consisting of an Unbundled Local Loop(s) and
Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT), together with any facilities, equipment, or functions necessary to combine
those UNEs (including, for example, multiplexing capabilities) subject to the Cap limitations as identified within the
Unbundled Local Loop and Unbundled Transport sections below. A DS1 or higher EEL is required to terminate in a
Collocation arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.3.1 below of this Attachment (e.g., the end of the
UDT that is opposite the end connected to the 251(c)(3) UNE Local Loop, must be accessed by CLEC at such a
CLEC collocation arrangement via a cross-connect).
2.7 “Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) Loops” means local Loops consisting of fiber optic cable connecting to a copper
distribution plant that is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the End User’s premises or, in the case of
predominantly residential MDUs, not more than five hundred (500) feet from the MDU’s MPOE. The fiber optic cable
in a FTTC Loop must connect to a copper distribution plant at a serving area interface from which every other copper
distribution subloop also is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the respective End User’s premises.
2.8 “Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Loops” means local Loops consisting entirely of fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit,
serving an End User’s premises or, in the case of predominantly residential multiple dwelling units (MDUs), a fiber
optic cable, whether dark or lit, that extends to the MDU minimum point of entry (MPOE).
2.9 “Hybrid UNE Loop” means a Local UNE Loop composed of both fiber optic cable, usually in the feeder plant, and
copper twisted wire and cable, usually in the distribution plant. AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC access to Hybrid
UNE Loops pursuant to the requirements of 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(a)(2).
2.10 “Unbundled Local Loop(s) (UNE Loop)” means a transmission facility between a distribution frame (or its equivalent)
in an AT&T-21STATE central office and the UNE Loop Demarcation Point at an End User premises. Facilities that
do not terminate at a Demarcation Point at an End User premises, including, by way of example, but not limited to,
facilities that terminate to another carrier’s switch or premises, a cell site, mobile switching center or base station, do
not constitute UNE Loops. The UNE Loop includes all features, functions, and capabilities of the transmission
facilities, including the Network Interface Device, and attached electronics (except those used for the provision of
advanced services, such as Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs)), optronics and intermediate

devices (including repeaters and load coils) used to establish the transmission path to the End User’s premises,
including inside wire owned or controlled by AT&T-21STATE.
2.11 “Network Interface Device (NID)” means any interconnection of End User premises wiring to AT&T-21STATE’s
distribution UNE Loop facilities, such as a cross-connect device used for that purpose. Fundamentally, the NID
establishes the final (and official) network demarcation point between the UNE Loop and the End User’s inside wire.
2.12 “Ratcheting” means a pricing mechanism that involves billing a single circuit at multiple rates to develop a single,
blended rate.
2.13 “Route” means a transmission path between one of AT&T-21STATE’s Wire Centers or switches and another of
AT&T-21STATE’s Wire Centers or switches. A Route between two points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire
Center or switch “Z”) may pass through one (1) or more intermediate Wire Centers or switches (e.g., Wire Center or
switch “X”). Transmission paths between identical end points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire Center or
switch “Z”) are the same Route, irrespective of whether they pass through the same intermediate Wire Centers or
switches, if any.
2.14 “Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT)” means AT&T-21STATE interoffice transmission facilities between Wire
Centers or switches owned by AT&T-21STATE, or between Wire Centers or switches owned by AT&T-21STATE
and switches owned by requesting Telecommunications Carriers, dedicated to a particular End User or carrier.
AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access to Dedicated Transport that does not
connect a pair of AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers.
2.15 “UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber/Dark Fiber Transport” means AT&T-21STATE dark fiber interoffice
transmission facilities dedicated to a particular CLEC that are within AT&T-21STATE’s network, connecting AT&T-
21STATE switches or Wire Centers within a LATA. Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber consists of un-activated optical
interoffice transmission facilities.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 The rates for UNEs, UNE Combinations and Other Services are set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
3.2 If CLEC procures any UNEs, UNE Combinations and/or Other Services for which rates are not currently in the Pricing
Schedule, AT&T-21STATE then reserves the right to charge a current state-specific price/market-based rate.
3.3 Without limitation, a UNE under this Agreement is Declassified upon or by (a) the issuance of an effective finding by
a court or regulatory agency acting within its authority that requesting Telecommunications Carriers are not impaired
without access to a particular UNE; or (b) an effective determination by a legislative, judicial or regulatory body
finding that an ILEC is not required, or is no longer required, to provide the UNE pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the
Act; or (c) the absence, by vacatur or otherwise, of a legally effective FCC rule requiring the provision of the UNE on
an unbundled basis pursuant to Section 251(c)(3). By way of example only, a UNE can be Declassified generally, or
on an element-specific, Route-specific or geographically-specific basis or on a class of elements basis. For
declassification of elements as the result of changes to Wire Center designations, Section 14.0 below shall apply.
3.4 If this Agreement requires or appears to require UNE(s) or the unbundling of an element without specifically noting a
particular UNE or UNEs, the reference shall be deemed to be a reference to 251(c )(3) UNE(s), as defined in this
Attachment. If a UNE is Declassified or is not required to be provided under this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment and/or
not described in this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment, it is the Parties’ intent that the UNE is not available under this
Agreement, notwithstanding any reference to the UNE elsewhere in the Agreement, including in any other
Attachment, or in the Pricing Schedule.
3.5 Transition Procedure for UNEs that are Declassified during the Term of the Agreement:
3.5.1 The procedure set forth in this Section does not apply to the Declassification events described in Sections
8.1.4 below, Section 9.1.6 below which set forth the consequences for Declassification of DS1 and DS3
Loops, DS1 and DS3 Transport and Dark Fiber Transport, where applicable Caps are met, or where
Declassification occurs because Wire Centers/Routes meet the criteria set forth in the FCC’s TRO Remand
Order (TRRO).

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
3.5.1.1 AT&T-21STATE shall only be obligated to provide Section 251 (c)(3) UNEs under this
Agreement as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and
effective FCC and judicial orders. To the extent an element described as a UNE or an
Unbundled Network Element in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a UNE,
AT&T-21STATE may discontinue the provision of such element, whether previously provided
alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement with other UNEs or other
elements or services. Accordingly, in the event one (1) or more elements described as UNEs or
as Unbundled Network Elements in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a
UNE, AT&T-21STATE will identify such Declassified UNEs and provide written Notice to CLEC
of its discontinuance of the element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the
element(s) has been previously provided. During a “Transitional Period” of thirty (30) calendar
days from the date of such Notice, AT&T-21STATE agrees to continue providing such
element(s) under the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of such written Notice, CLEC will
cease ordering elements that are identified as Declassified or as otherwise no longer being
available as a UNE in the AT&T-21STATE Notice letter. AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to
review CLEC’s orders transmitted to AT&T-21STATE and to the extent that CLEC has
processed orders and such orders are provisioned after the Transitional Period, such elements
are still subject to this Section, including the options set forth in (a) and (b) below, and AT&T-
21STATE’s rights of discontinuance or conversion in the event the options are not accomplished.
During the Transitional Period, the following options are available to CLEC with regard to the
element(s) identified in the AT&T-21STATE Notice, including the combination or other
arrangement in which the element(s) were previously provided:
3.5.1.1.1 CLEC may issue a Local Service Request (LSR) or Access Service Request
(ASR), as applicable, to seek disconnection or other discontinuance of the
element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the element(s)
were previously provided; or
3.5.1.1.2 AT&T-21STATE and CLEC may agree upon another service arrangement or
element (e.g., via a separate agreement at market-based rates to the extent AT&T-
21STATE offers such an agreement, or an equivalent tariffed AT&T-21STATE
service, or resale), or may agree that an analogous access product or service may
be substituted, if available.
3.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at
the end of that thirty (30) calendar day Transitional Period described in Section 3.5.1.1 above, unless CLEC
has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as applicable, under (a), above, and/or if CLEC
and AT&T-21STATE have failed to reach agreement under (b), above, as to a substitute service
arrangement or element, then AT&T-21STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect the element(s), whether
previously provided alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement, or convert the subject
element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement to an analogous
resale or access service, if available.
4.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
4.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide access to UNEs for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act,
Section 251(c)(3)).
4.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for the services it provides to its End Users and to other Telecommunications
Carriers.
4.3 CLEC’s use of any AT&T-21STATE UNE, or of its own equipment or facilities in conjunction with any AT&T-
21STATE UNE, must not materially interfere with or impair service over any facilities of AT&T-21STATE, its affiliated
companies or its connecting and concurring carriers involved in its services, cause damage to their plant, impair the
privacy of any communications carried over their facilities or create hazards to the employees of any of them or the
public. Upon reasonable written Notice and opportunity to cure, AT&T-21STATE may discontinue or refuse service if

Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-21STATE
Page 7 of 24
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
CLEC violates this provision, provided that such termination of service will be limited to CLEC’s use of the UNE(s)
causing the violation.
4.4 Where processes for any UNE provided pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or in conjunction with any other
UNE(s) or service(s), are not already in place, AT&T-21STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any
associated rates, terms and conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable change management guidelines
found on AT&T CLEC Online website.
4.5 Performance of UNEs:
4.5.1 Each UNE will be provided in accordance with AT&T-21STATE technical publications or other written
descriptions, if any, as changed from time to time by AT&T-21STATE at its sole discretion.
4.5.2 Nothing in this Attachment shall limit either Party’s ability to upgrade its network through the incorporation of
new equipment, new software or otherwise or to otherwise change and/or modify its network including,
without limitation, through the retirement and/or replacement of equipment, software or otherwise. Each
Party agrees to comply with the Network Disclosure rules adopted by the FCC in CC Docket No. 96-98,
Second Report and Order, codified at 47 C.F.R. §§ 51.325 through 51.335, as such rules maybe amended
from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
4.5.3 AT&T-21STATE may elect to conduct upgrades or conversions for the improvement of its network or
systems. During such upgrades or conversions, CLEC orders for UNEs from affected Wire Center(s) may
be suspended for a period of a few days prior and one (1) day after the upgrade or conversion date,
consistent with the suspension AT&T-21STATE places on itself for orders from its End Users and other
CLECs’ End Users.
4.5.4 CLEC will be solely responsible, at its own expense, for the overall design of its Telecommunications
Services and for any redesigning or rearrangement of its Telecommunications Services that may be
required because of changes in facilities, operations, or procedure of AT&T-21STATE minimum network
protection criteria, or operating or maintenance characteristics of the facilities.
4.6 Conditions for Access to UNEs:
4.6.1 CLEC cannot use a UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs, or otherwise),
with a network element possessed by CLEC (or otherwise) to provide service to itself, or for other
administrative purpose(s).
4.6.2 CLEC may not access UNEs for the exclusive provision of mobile wireless services, or long distance
services or interexchange services.
4.6.3 Other conditions to accessing and using any UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with
other UNEs, with a network element possessed by CLEC, or otherwise) may be applicable under effective
FCC rules. Associated and effective FCC and judicial orders shall also apply.
4.6.4 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Access to UNEs without compromising the security, integrity, and reliability of
the public switched network, as well as to minimize potential service disruptions.
4.6.5 Reference Attachment 12 - Collocation for methods of access to and/or Interconnection with AT&T-
21STATE 251(c )(3) UNEs.
5.0 Cross-Connects / Central Office Channel Interfaces (COCI)
5.1.1 In the AT&T-21STATE Premises where CLEC is either Physically Collocated (e.g., in a caged, cageless or
shared cage arrangement) or Virtually Collocated (see Attachment 12 - Collocation), AT&T-21STATE will
extend AT&T-21STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs via-cross connects to CLEC’s Physical or Virtual Collocation Point
of Termination (POT), within the same AT&T-21STATE Premises where the 251(c)(3) UNEs are located.
5.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide cross-connects at the rates, terms, and conditions set forth in the Pricing
Schedule.

of this Agreement.
6.2.4 Orders for Conversions will be handled in accordance with the guidelines posted on AT&T CLEC Online
website.
6.2.5 Where processes for the Conversion requested pursuant to this Attachment are not already in place, the
Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum guidelines.
6.2.6 If CLEC does not meet the applicable eligibility criteria or, for any reason, stops meeting the eligibility criteria
for a particular Conversion of a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the equivalent
251(c)(3) UNE, or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, CLEC shall not request such Conversion or continue
using such 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNEs that result from such Conversion. To the extent CLEC fails to
meet (including ceases to meet) the eligibility criteria applicable to a 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of
251(c)(3) UNEs, AT&T-21STATE may convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNE combination to the
equivalent wholesale service or group of wholesale services, upon written Notice to CLEC.
6.2.6.1 This Section applies to any 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, including whether
or not such 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs had been previously converted
from an AT&T-21STATE service.
6.2.6.2 AT&T-21STATE may exercise its rights provided for hereunder and those allowed by law to
ensure compliance with any applicable eligibility criteria.
6.2.7 Conversion Pricing:
6.2.7.1 AT&T-21STATE shall charge the applicable non-recurring service order charge and applicable
switch-as-is rates as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, for Conversions to specific UNE/UNE
Combinations. AT&T-21STATE shall also charge the applicable non-recurring service order
charge and applicable switch-as-is rates, as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, when converting
from UNE/UNE combinations.
6.3 Commingling:
6.3.1 Commingling is not permitted, nor is AT&T-21STATE required to perform the functions necessary to
Commingle, where the Commingled Arrangement (i) is not technically feasible, including that network
reliability and security would be impaired; or (ii) would impair AT&T-21STATE’s ability to retain responsibility
for the management, control, and performance of its network; or (iii) would place AT&T-21STATE at a
disadvantage in operating its own network; or (iv) would undermine the ability of other Telecommunications
Carriers to obtain access to UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s network.
6.3.2 Where processes for any Commingling requested pursuant to this Agreement (including, by way of
example, for existing services sought to be converted to a Commingled Arrangement) are not already in
place, AT&T-21STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and
conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum (CUF)
guidelines and/or will be developed pursuant to the BFR process.
6.3.3 Any Commingling obligation is limited solely to Commingling of one (1) or more facilities or services that are
provided at wholesale from AT&T-21STATE with UNEs; accordingly, no other facilities, services or
functionalities are subject to Commingling, including but not limited to facilities, services or functionalities
that AT&T-21STATE might offer pursuant to Section 271 of the Act.
6.3.4 Except as provided in Section 6.3 above and, further, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,

AT&T-21STATE to complete the actual Commingling), except that AT&T-21STATE shall have no obligation
to perform the functions necessary to Commingle (or to complete the actual Commingling) if (i) Section 6.2.1
above applies to the Commingled Arrangement sought by CLEC; or (ii) CLEC is able to perform those
functions itself. Where CLEC is a new entrant and is unaware that it needs to Commingle to provide a
Telecommunications Service, AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to Commingle ceases if AT&T-21STATE
informs CLEC of such need to Commingle.
6.3.6 For purposes of Section 6.3.1 above and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
Commingle for itself, CLEC is deemed able to Commingle for itself when the UNE(s), UNE combination, and
facilities or services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-21STATE are available to CLEC at CLEC’s
Collocation Arrangement. For Collocation terms and conditions see Attachment 12 – Collocation.
6.3.7 AT&T-21STATE has developed a list of Commingled Arrangements that will be available for ordering. This
list is posted on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
6.3.7.1 Any request by CLEC for a Commingled Arrangement not included in such list may be made via
Attachment 08 - Bona Fide Request. In any such BFR, CLEC must designate among other
things the 251(c)(3) UNE(s), combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, and the facilities or services that
CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-21STATE sought to be Commingled and the
needed location(s), the order in which such 251(c)(3) UNEs, such combinations of 251(c)(3)
UNEs, and such facilities and services are to be Commingled, and how each connection (e.g.,
cross-connected) is to be made between them.
6.3.8 AT&T-21STATE will charge the appropriate recurring and non-recurring rates as identified in the Pricing
Schedule. AT&T-21STATE shall charge the appropriate non-recurring rates as set forth in the Pricing
Schedule(s) applicable to the 251(c)(3) UNEs (or 251(c)(3) UNE combinations) that are Commingled on a
251(c)(3) UNE-by-251(c)(3) UNE basis, and for the facilities and services that are Commingled (under this
Section 6.3 above) on a facility-by-facility, service-by-service basis, including without limitation for the type
of service and activity being requested to create the Commingled Arrangement.
6.3.9 AT&T-21STATE shall not be required to, and shall not, provide Ratcheting as a result of Commingling or a
Commingled Arrangement.
6.4 Mandatory Eligibility Criteria for Access to Certain UNEs
6.4.1 Except as provided below in this Section or elsewhere in the Agreement and subject to this Section and
Section 6.2 above, Conversion of Wholesale Services to 251(c)(3) UNEs, of this Attachment, AT&T-
21STATE shall provide access to 251(c)(3) UNEs and combinations of 251(c)(3) UNEs without regard to
whether CLEC seeks access to the 251(c)(3) UNEs to establish a new circuit or to convert an existing circuit
from a wholesale service to 251(c)(3) UNEs.
6.4.2 AT&T-21STATE is not obligated, and shall not, provide access to (1) an unbundled DS1 UNE Loop in
combination, or Commingled, with a DS1 UDT facility or service or a DS3 or higher UDT facility or service,

(“Local Telephone Number”), prior to the provision of service over that circuit (and
for each circuit, CLEC will provide the corresponding Local Telephone Number(s)
as part of the required certification); and
6.4.2.1.2 Each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 EEL or on any other Included Arrangement,
must have its own Local Telephone Number assignment, so that each DS3 must
have at least twenty-eight (28) Local voice Telephone Numbers assigned to it; and
6.4.2.1.3 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will have 911 or E911 capability prior
to the provision of service over that circuit; and
6.4.2.1.4 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will terminate in a Collocation
arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.3 below of this
Attachment; and
6.4.2.1.5 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be served by an Interconnection
Trunk that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.4 below of this Attachment; and
6.4.2.1.6 For each twenty-four (24) DS1 EELs, or other facilities having equivalent capacity,
CLEC will have at least one active DS1 local service interconnection Trunk that
meets the requirements of Section 6.4.4 below of this Attachment; and
6.4.2.1.7 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be served by a switch capable of

6.4.2.1.8 AT&T-21STATE shall not be required to provide, and shall not provide, any
251(c)(3) UNE Combination of a 251(c)(3) UNE Local Loop and UDT at DS1 or
higher (whether as a UNE Combination by themselves, with a network element
possessed by CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling, or whether as a new
arrangement or from a Conversion of an existing service/circuit) that does not
terminate to a Collocation arrangement that meets the requirements of Section
6.4.3 below of this Attachment.
6.4.3 A Collocation arrangement meets the requirements of Section 6.4 above of this Attachment if it is:
6.4.3.1 Established pursuant to Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and located at AT&T-21STATE Premises
within the same LATA as the End User’s premises, when AT&T-21STATE is not the Collocator;
or
6.4.3.2 Located at a Third Party’s premises within the same LATA as the End User’s premises, when
AT&T-21STATE is the Collocator.
6.4.4 An Interconnection Trunk meets the requirements of Section 6.4.2.1.5 above and Section 6.4.2.1.6 above of
this Attachment if CLEC will transmit the calling party’s local telephone number in connection with calls
exchanged over the Trunk, and the Trunk is located in the same LATA as the End User premises served by
the Included Arrangement.
6.4.5 For a new circuit to which Section 6.4.2 above applies, CLEC may initiate the ordering process if CLEC
certifies that it will not begin to provide any service over that circuit until a local telephone number is
assigned and 911/E911 capability is provided, as required by Section 6.4.2.1.1 above and Section 6.4.2.1.3
above respectively. In such case, CLEC shall satisfy Section 6.4.2.1.1 above and/or Section 6.4.2.1.3
above if it assigns the required Local Telephone Number(s), and implements 911/E911 capability, within
thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-21STATE provisions such new circuit. CLEC must provide AT&T-
21STATE with sufficient proof that such assignment and/or implementation has occurred by the end of such
thirtieth (30th) day.
6.4.5.1 Section 6.4.5 above does not apply to existing circuits to which Section 6.4.2 above applies,
including Conversions or migrations (e.g., CLEC shall not be excused from meeting the Section

Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
6.4.2.1.1 above and Section 6.4.2.1.3 above requirements for existing circuits at the time it
initiates the ordering process).
6.4.6 CLEC hereby agrees that by submitting an order to AT&T-21STATE for an Included Arrangement (whether
new, as a result of a requested Conversion, or otherwise), CLEC is certifying that it meets and will continue
to meet the requirements of Section 6.4 above as to such Included Arrangement(s) on a circuit-by-
circuit/service-by-service/Included Arrangement-by-Included Arrangement basis. Such certification-by-order
shall have the same weight and effect as a separate certification, and certification-by-order shall not
diminish or otherwise affect CLEC’s obligation to meet and to continue to comply with the criteria or
certification requirements set forth in this Section.
6.4.6.1 If the information previously provided in a certification is inaccurate (or ceases to be accurate),
CLEC shall update such certification promptly with AT&T-21STATE.
6.4.7 In addition to any other audit rights provided for this Agreement and those allowed by law, AT&T-21STATE
may obtain and pay for an independent auditor to audit CLEC, on an annual basis, applied on a State-by-
State basis, for compliance with this Section. For purposes of calculating and applying an “annual basis”, it
means a consecutive twelve (12) month period for each individual State, beginning upon AT&T-21STATE’s
written Notice that an audit will be performed for that State, subject to Section 6.4.7.4 below.
6.4.7.1 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties (including at the time of the audit), the independent
auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the standards established by the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which will require the auditor to
perform an “examination engagement” and issue an opinion regarding CLEC’s compliance with
the qualifying service eligibility criteria.
6.4.7.2 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all material respects
with this Section 6.4 above.
6.4.7.3 Consistent with standard auditing practices, such audits require compliance testing designed by
the independent auditor, which typically includes an examination of a sample selected in
accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment.
6.4.7.4 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with this
Section 6.4 above, CLEC must true-up any difference in payments beginning from the date that
the non-compliant circuit was established as a 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combination, in whole or in
part (notwithstanding any other provision hereof), CLEC must convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or
251(c)(3) UNE Combination, or Commingled Arrangement, to an equivalent or substantially
similar wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, (and AT&T-21STATE may initiate and
affect such a conversion on its own without any further consent by CLEC), and CLEC shall timely
make the correct payments on a going-forward basis, and all applicable remedies for failure to
make such payments shall be available to AT&T-21STATE. In no event shall rates set under
Section 252(d)(1) of the Act apply for the use of any 251(c)(3) UNE for any period in which CLEC
does not meet the conditions set forth in this Section 6.4 above for that 251(c)(3) UNE,
arrangement, or circuit, as the case may be. Also, the “annual basis” calculation and application
shall be immediately reset, (e.g., AT&T-21STATE shall not have to wait the remaining part of the
consecutive twelve (12) month period before it is permitted to audit again in that state).
6.4.7.4.1 To the extent that the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to
comply in all material respects with this Section 6.4 above, CLEC must reimburse
AT&T-21STATE for the cost of the independent auditor and for AT&T-21STATE’s
costs in the same manner and using the same methodology and rates that AT&T-
21STATE is required to pay CLEC’s costs under Section 6.4.7.4.2 below.
6.4.7.4.2 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC complied in all
material respects with this Section 6.4 above, AT&T-21STATE must reimburse
CLEC for its reasonable staff time and other reasonable costs associated in

responding to the audit (e.g., collecting data in response to the auditor’s inquiries,
meeting for interviews, etc.).
6.4.7.5 CLEC will maintain the appropriate documentation to support its eligibility certifications including,
without limitation, call detail records, local telephone number assignment documentation, and
switch assignment documentation.
6.4.8 Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel, laches,
or similar concepts in other situations, CLEC shall fully comply with this Section in all cases and, further, the
failure of AT&T-21STATE to require such compliance, including if AT&T-21STATE provides a circuit(s), an
EEL(s), or a Commingled circuit, that does not meet any eligibility criteria, including those in this Section,
shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not
act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder.
7.0 Network Interface Device (NID)
7.1.1 Subject to Section 3.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE shall provide unbundled access to the
Unbundled Network Interface Device (NID) under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
7.1.2 The Maintenance and control of the End User’s inside wiring (on the End User’s side of the UNE NID) is
under the control of the End User. Conflicts between telephone service providers for access to the End
User’s inside wire must be resolved by the End User. Pursuant to applicable FCC rules, AT&T-21STATE
offers nondiscriminatory access to the NID on an unbundled basis to CLEC for the provision of a
Telecommunications Service.
7.1.3 AT&T-21STATE will permit CLEC to connect its UNE Loop facilities to an End User’s premises wiring
through AT&T-21STATE’s NID, or at any other technically feasible point.
7.1.4 Any repairs, upgrade and rearrangements to the NID required by CLEC will be performed by AT&T-
21STATE based on Time and Material charges. AT&T-21STATE, at the request of CLEC, will disconnect
the AT&T-21STATE UNE Loop from the NID at charges reflected in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.5 With respect to multiple dwelling units or multiple-unit business premises, CLEC will connect directly with
the End User’s premises wire, or may connect with the End User’s premises wire via AT&T-21STATE’s NID
where necessary.
7.1.6 The AT&T-21STATE NIDs that CLEC uses under this Attachment will be existing NIDs installed by AT&T-
21STATE to serve its End Users.
7.1.7 CLEC shall not attach to or disconnect AT&T-21STATE’s ground. CLEC shall not cut or disconnect AT&T-
21STATE’s UNE Loop from the NID and/or its protector. CLEC shall not cut any other leads in the UNE
NID.
7.1.8 CLEC, when it has constructed its own NID at a premises and needs only to make contact with AT&T-
21STATE’s NID, can disconnect the End User’s wiring from AT&T-21STATE’s NID and reconnect it to
CLEC’s NID.
8.0 UNE Loop
8.1.1 Subject to Section 3.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE shall provide unbundled access to UNE
Loops under the terms and conditions in this subsection.
8.1.2 Consistent with the applicable FCC rules, AT&T-21STATE will make available the UNE Loops set forth
herein below between a distribution frame (or its equivalent) in an AT&T-21STATE central office and the
UNE Loop demarcation point at an End User premises. The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-
21STATE shall not be obligated to provision any of the UNE Loops provided for herein to cellular sites or to
any other location that does not constitute an End User premises. Where applicable, the UNE Loop
includes all wire within multiple dwelling and tenant Buildings and campuses that provides access to End
User premises wiring, provided such wire is owned and controlled by AT&T-21STATE. The UNE Loop
includes, but is not limited to copper UNE Loops (two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade copper UNE

as two-wire and four-wire copper UNE Loops conditioned, at CLEC’s request and subject to charges, to
transmit the digital signals needed to provide digital subscriber line services, DS1 UNE Loops (where they
have not been Declassified and subject to Caps set forth in Section 8.1.3.4.4 below) and DS3 UNE Loops
(where they have not been Declassified and subject to Caps set forth in Section 8.1.3.5.4 below) where
such UNE Loops are deployed and available in AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers. CLEC agrees to operate
each UNE Loop type within applicable technical standards and parameters.
8.1.2.1 When a UNE Local Loop is ordered to a high voltage area, the Parties understand and agree
that such UNE Loop will require High Voltage Protective Equipment (HVPE) (e.g., a positron), to
ensure the safety and integrity of the network, the Parties’ employees and/or representatives,
and CLEC’s End User. Therefore, any request by CLEC for a UNE Loop to a high voltage area
will be submitted by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE via the BFR process set forth in Attachment 08 –
Bona Fide Request, and CLEC shall be required to pay AT&T-21STATE for any HVPE that is
provisioned by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC in connection with CLEC’s UNE Local Loop order to
the high voltage area.
8.1.3 The following types of UNE Loops will be provided at the rates, terms, and conditions set forth in this

CLEC has already obtained ten DS1 UNE Loops at the same Building. If,
notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such an order, at AT&T-21STATE’s
option it may accept or reject the order, but convert any requested DS1 UNE
Loop(s) in excess of the Cap to Special Access; applicable Special Access charges
will apply to CLEC for such DS1 UNE Loop(s) as of the date of provisioning.
8.1.3.5 AT&T-21STATE DS3 UNE Loop
8.1.3.5.1 A DS3 UNE Loop provides a digital transmission facility from an AT&T-21STATE
central office to an End User’s premises. A DS3 loop is a digital local loop having a
total digital speed of 44.736 Mbps.
8.1.3.5.2 DS3 UNE Loops will be offered and/or provided only where such UNE Loops have
not been Declassified.
8.1.3.5.3 The procedures set forth in Section 8.1.4.2 below will apply in the event DS3 UNE
Loops are or have been Declassified.
8.1.3.5.4 DS3 UNE Loop “Caps” – AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to provide to CLEC more
than one (1) DS3 UNE Loop per requesting carrier to any single Building in which
DS3 UNE Loops have not been otherwise Declassified; accordingly, CLEC may not
order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering unbundled DS3 UNE
Loops once CLEC has already obtained one DS3 UNE Loop at the same Building.
If, notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such an order, at AT&T-21STATE’s
option it may accept or reject the order, but convert any requested DS3 UNE
Loop(s) in excess of the Cap to Special Access; applicable Special Access charges
will apply to CLEC for such DS3 UNE Loop(s) as of the date of provisioning.
8.1.3.6 FTTH/FTTC Loops
8.1.3.6.1 In new build (i.e., greenfield) areas, AT&T-21STATE is not required to provide
access to any FTTH/FTTC Loops on an unbundled basis when AT&T-21STATE
deploys any such Loop to a residential unit that previously has not been served by
any Loop facility.
8.1.3.6.2 In Overbuild situations where AT&T-21STATE has deployed a FTTH or FTTC
Loop parallel to, or in replacement of, an existing copper Loop facility and has not
retired the copper Loop pursuant to 47 C.F.R § 51.319(a)(3)(iv), AT&T-21STATE is
not required to provide access to any FTTH/FTTC Loops on an unbundled basis
when AT&T-21STATE has deployed any such Loop parallel to, or in replacement
of an existing copper Loop facility, except that:
8.1.3.6.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will maintain the existing copper Loop connected to
the particular End User’s premises after deploying the FTTH/FTTC
Loop and provide nondiscriminatory access to that copper Loop on
an unbundled basis, unless AT&T-21STATE retires the copper Loop
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(a)(3)(iv).
8.1.3.6.2.2 When AT&T-21STATE maintains the existing copper Loops pursuant
to 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(a)(3)(iii)(A), AT&T-21STATE need not incur
any expenses to ensure that the existing copper Loop remains
capable of transmitting signals prior to receiving a request for access
pursuant to that section, in which case AT&T-21STATE shall restore
the copper Loop to serviceable condition upon request.
8.1.3.6.2.3 AT&T-21STATE may retire copper Loops that have been replaced
with FTTH/FTTC facilities using the FCC’s network disclosure

shall provide CLEC with access to a DS1 UNE Loop, where available, to any Building not served
by a Wire Center with sixty thousand (60,000) or more business lines and four (4) or more fiber-
based Collocators. Once a Wire Center exceeds these thresholds, no future DS1 Loop
unbundling will be required in that Wire Center, or any Buildings served by that Wire Center, and
DS1 UNE Loops in that Wire Center, or any Buildings served by that Wire Center, shall be
Declassified and no longer available as UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may
not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering DS1 UNE Loops in such Wire
Center(s), or any Buildings served by such Wire Center(s).
8.1.4.2 DS3 UNE Loop – Subject to the Cap described in Section 8.1.3.5.4 above, AT&T-21STATE
shall provide CLEC with access to a DS3 UNELoop, where available, to any Building not served
by a Wire Center with at least 38,000 business lines and at least four (4) fiber-based Collocators.
Once a Wire Center exceeds these thresholds, no future DS3 UNE Loop unbundling will be
required in that Wire Center, or any Buildings served by that Wire Center, and DS3 UNE Loops
in that Wire Center, or any Buildings served by that Wire Center, shall be Declassified, and no
longer available as UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise
obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering DS3 UNE Loops in such Wire Center(s), or any Buildings
served by such Wire Center(s).
8.1.4.3 Effect on Embedded Base – Upon Declassification of DS1 UNE Loops and/or DS3 UNE Loops
already purchased by CLEC as UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE will provide
written Notice to CLEC of such Declassification and proceed in accordance with Sections 14.0
below 15.0 below, and 16.0 below.
8.1.4.3.1 Products provided by AT&T-21STATE in conjunction with such UNE Loops (e.g.,
cross-connects) shall also be subject to re-pricing under this Section and Section
14.0 below where such UNE Loops are Declassified.

9.1.5.1 Multiplexing – an option ordered in conjunction with DS1 or DS3 UDT that converts a circuit from
higher to lower bandwidth, or from digital to voice grade. Multiplexing is only available when
ordered at the same time as DS1 or DS3 UDT and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
9.1.5.2 DS3 UDT Caps – AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to provide to CLEC more than twelve (12)
DS3 UDT circuits on each Route on which DS3 Dedicated Transport has not been otherwise
Declassified; accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease
ordering unbundled DS3 Dedicated Transport once CLEC has already obtained twelve DS3 UDT
circuits on the same Route. If, notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such an order, at
AT&T-21STATE’s option, it may accept or reject the order, but convert any requested DS3 UDT
in excess of the Cap to Special Access; applicable Special Access charges will apply to CLEC
for such DS3 Dedicated Transport circuits as of the date of provisioning.
9.1.5.3 DS1 UDT Caps - AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to provide to CLEC more than ten (10) DS1
251(c)(3) UDT circuits on each route on which DS1 Dedicated Transport has not been otherwise
Declassified; accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease
ordering unbundled DS1 Dedicated Transport once CLEC has already obtained ten DS1
251(c)(3) UDT circuits on the same route. If, notwithstanding this Section, CLEC submits such
an order, at AT&T-21STATE’s option it may accept the order, but convert any requested DS1
251(c)(3) UDT in excess of the Cap to Special Access, and applicable Special Access charges
will apply to CLEC for such DS1 Dedicated Transport circuits as of the date of provisioning.
9.1.6 Declassification Procedure
9.1.6.1 Wire Center “Tiers” – For purposes of Sections 9.0 above and 10.0 below Wire Centers are
classified into three “tiers” as follows:
9.1.6.1.1 Tier 1 Wire Centers are those AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers that contain at least
four (4) fiber-based Collocators, at least 38,000 business lines, or both. Tier 1 Wire
Centers also are those AT&T-21STATE tandem switching locations that have no
Line-Side switching facilities, but nevertheless serve as a point of traffic
aggregation accessible by CLEC. Once a Wire Center is determined to be a Tier 1
Wire Center, that Wire Center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 2 or
Tier 3 Wire Center.
9.1.6.1.2 Tier 2 Wire Centers are those AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers that are not Tier 1
Wire Centers, but contain at least three (3) fiber-based Collocators, at least 24,000
business lines, or both. Once a Wire Center is determined to be a Tier 2 Wire
Center, that Wire Center is not subject to later reclassification as a Tier 3 Wire
Center.
9.1.6.1.3 Tier 3 Wire Centers are those AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers that do not meet the
criteria for Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers.
9.1.6.2 DS1 Dedicated Transport Declassification
9.1.6.2.1 Subject to the Cap described in Section 9.1.5.3 above AT&T-21STATE shall
provide CLEC with access to DS1 UDT on Routes, except Routes where both Wire
Centers defining the Route are Tier 1 Wire Centers. As such, AT&T-21STATE
must provide UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport under this Agreement only if a Wire
Center at either end of a requested Route is not a Tier 1 Wire Center, or if neither
is a Tier 1 Wire Center. DS1 Dedicated Transport circuits on Routes between Tier
1 Wire Centers are Declassified and no longer available as UNEs under this
Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will
cease ordering DS1 UNE Dedicated Transport on such Route(s).
9.1.6.3 DS3 Dedicated Transport Declassification

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
9.1.6.3.1 Subject to the Cap described in 9.1.5.2 above, AT&T-21STATE shall provide
CLEC with access to DS3 UDT, except on Routes where both Wire Centers
defining the Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers. As such, AT&T-
21STATE must provide DS3 UDT under this Agreement only if a Wire Center on
either end of the requested Route is a Tier 3 Wire Center. If both Wire Centers
defining a requested Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, then DS3
Dedicated Transport circuits on such Routes are Declassified and no longer
available as UNEs under this Agreement. Accordingly, CLEC may not order or
otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering DS3 UNE Dedicated Transport on
such Route(s).
9.1.6.4 Effect on Embedded Base – Upon Declassification of DS1 Dedicated Transport or DS3
Dedicated Transport already purchased by CLEC as UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-
21STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC of such Declassification, and proceed in
accordance with Sections 14.0 below, 15.0 below and 16.0 below.
9.1.6.4.1 Products provided by AT&T-21STATE in conjunction with UNE DS1 and DS3
Dedicated Transport (e.g., cross-connects) shall also be subject to re-pricing under
the section where Dedicated Transport is Declassified.
9.1.6.5 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-21STATE under this Section 9.1.7 above shall not be
subject to the Network Disclosure Rules.
10.0 UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber
10.1 Subject to Section 4.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE shall provide unbundled access to Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber under the following terms and conditions in this subsection. AT&T-21STATE is not required to
provide UNE Loop and/or Dark Fiber Loop on an unbundled basis.
10.2 Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is deployed, unlit optical fiber within AT&T-21STATE’s network. Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber charges are set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
10.3 At Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber segments in Routes that have not been Declassified, AT&T-21STATE will provide
a UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber segment that is considered “spare” as defined in Sections 10.4 below.
AT&T-21STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access to Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber that
does not connect a pair of AT&T-21STATE Wire Centers. AT&T-21STATE will offer UNE Dedicated Transport Dark
Fiber to CLEC when CLEC has Collocation space in each AT&T-21STATE central office where the requested UNE
Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber(s) terminate.
10.4 Spare Dark Fiber Transport Inventory Availability and Condition:
10.4.1 All available spare UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber will be provided as is. No conditioning will be
offered.
10.4.2 Spare Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is fiber that can be spliced in all segments, point to point but not
assigned. Spare Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber does not include maintenance spares, fibers set aside and
documented for AT&T-21STATE’s forecasted growth, defective fibers, or fibers subscribed to by other
Telecommunications Carriers.
10.4.3 CLEC will not obtain any more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the spare UNE Dedicated Transport Dark
Fiber contained in the requested segment during any two (2) year period.
10.5 CLEC requesting UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber must submit a Dark Fiber Facility Inquiry, providing CLEC’s
specific point-to-point (A to Z) dark fiber requirements. Rates for the Dark Fiber Facility Inquiry are as set forth in the

Page 19 of 24
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
10.7.1 Right of revocation of access to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is distinguishable from
Declassification. For clarification purposes, AT&T-21STATE’s right of revocation of access under this
Section applies even when the affected Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber remains a UNE, subject to
unbundling obligations under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, in which case CLEC’s rights to the affected
network element may be revoked as provided in this Section.
10.7.2 Should CLEC not utilize the fiber strand(s) subscribed to within the twelve (12) month period following the
date AT&T-21STATE provided the fiber(s), AT&T-21STATE may revoke CLEC’s access to the UNE
Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber and recover those fiber facilities and return them to AT&T-21STATE’s
inventory.
10.7.3 AT&T-21STATE may reclaim from CLEC the right to use UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, whether or
not such fiber is being utilized by CLEC, upon twelve (12) months written Notice to CLEC. If the reclaimed
UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber is not otherwise Declassified during the Notice period, AT&T-
21STATE will provide an alternative facility for CLEC with the same bandwidth CLEC was using prior to
reclaiming the facility. AT&T-21STATE must also demonstrate upon CLEC’s request that the reclaimed
Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber will be needed to meet AT&T-21STATE’s bandwidth requirements within
the twelve (12) months following the revocation.
10.8 Access Methods Specific to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber:
10.8.1 The termination point for UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber at central offices will be in an AT&T-
21STATE-approved splitter shelf. This arrangement allows for non-intrusive testing.
10.8.2 At central offices, UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber terminates on a fiber distribution frame, or
equivalent, in the central office. CLEC access is provided via Collocation.
10.9 For Installation and Maintenance for UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, refer to AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
10.9.1 AT&T-21STATE will install termination points and place the fiber jumpers from the fiber optic terminals to
the termination point. CLEC will run its fiber jumpers from the termination point (1x2, 90-10 optical splitter)
to CLEC.
10.10 Dark Fiber Transport Declassification:
10.10.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide CLEC with access to UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, except on Routes
where both Wire Centers defining the Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, as described in Section
14.0 below As such, AT&T-21STATE must provide UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber under this
Agreement only if a Wire Center on either end of the requested Route is a Tier 3 Wire Center. If both Wire
Centers defining a requested Route are either Tier 1 or Tier 2 Wire Centers, then Dedicated Transport Dark
Fiber circuits on such Routes are Declassified and no longer available as UNEs under this Agreement.
Accordingly, CLEC may not order or otherwise obtain, and CLEC will cease ordering UNE Dedicated
Transport Dark Fiber on such Route(s).
10.10.2 Effect on Embedded Base – Upon Declassification of Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber already purchased by
CLEC as UNEs under this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC of such
Declassification, and proceed in accordance with Section 14.0 below. At the end of the Notice period under
that Section, provision of the affected Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber to CLEC will be terminated without
further obligation of AT&T-21STATE.
10.10.3 Products provided by AT&T-21STATE in conjunction with UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber, if any, shall
also be subject to termination under this Section where such fiber is Declassified.
10.10.4 The Parties agree that activity by AT&T-21STATE under this Section shall not be subject to the Network
Disclosure Rules.
11.0 Routine Network Modifications for UNE Loops, UNE DS1, DS3 and Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport
11.1.1 AT&T-21STATE shall make Routine Network Modifications (RNM) to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and
Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport facilities used by CLEC where the requested UNE facility has already been

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-21STATE
Page 20 of 24
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
constructed. AT&T-21STATE shall perform RNM to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the UNE facility
being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
11.1.2 A “Routine Network Modification” is an activity that AT&T-21STATE regularly undertakes for its own
customers. RNM include rearranging or splicing of existing cable; adding an equipment case; adding a
doubler or repeater; adding a smart jack; installing a repeater shelf; adding a line card; deploying a new
multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and attaching electronic and other equipment that
AT&T-21STATE ordinarily attaches to activate such UNE Loops or Transport facilities for its own retail End
Users, under the same conditions and in the same manner that AT&T-21STATE does for its own End
Users. RNM may entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial
cable and installing equipment casings. AT&T-21STATE will place drops in the same manner as it does for
its own End Users.
11.1.3 RNM do not include constructing new UNE Loops; or UNE DS1, DS3, or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport;
installing new cable or fiber; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new manholes or
conduits; installing new terminals; or removing or reconfiguring packetized transmission facility. Nor do
RNM include the provision of electronics for the purpose of lighting dark fiber (i.e., optronics). AT&T-
21STATE is not obligated to perform those activities for CLEC.
11.1.4 AT&T-21STATE shall determine whether and how to perform RNM using the same network or outside plant
engineering principles that would be applied in providing service to AT&T-21STATE’s retail End Users.
11.1.5 AT&T-21STATE has no obligation to build Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) capability into new packet-
based networks or into existing packet-based networks that never had TDM capability.
11.1.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-21STATE’s obligations with respect to RNM apply
only where the UNE Loop and Transport transmission facilities are subject to unbundling and do not apply to
FTTH UNE Loops or FTTC UNE Loops.
11.1.7 AT&T-21STATE shall provide RNM at the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this Attachment and in the
Pricing Schedule or at rates to be determined on an individual case basis (ICB) or through the Special
Construction (SC) process. AT&T-21STATE will impose charges for RNM in instances where such charges
are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and non-recurring
charges. The Parties agree that the RNM for which AT&T-21STATE is not recovering costs in existing
recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which costs will be imposed on CLEC as an ICB/SC include,
but are not limited to: (i) adding an equipment case, (ii) adding a doubler or repeater including associated
line card(s), (iii) installing a repeater shelf, and any other necessary work and parts associated with a
repeater shelf, and (iv) where applicable, deploying multiplexing equipment, to the extent such equipment is
not present on the UNE Loop or Transport facility when ordered.
12.0 911/E911 Database
12.1.1 Access to the AT&T-21STATE 911/E911 call-related databases will be provided as described in Attachment
05 - 911/E911.
13.0 Operations Support Systems (OSS) Functions
13.1.1 Operations Support Systems Functions consist of pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance and
repair, and billing functions supported by AT&T-21STATE’s databases and information. AT&T-21STATE
will provide CLEC access to its OSS Functions as outlined in Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems
(OSS).
14.0 Non-Impaired Wire Center Criteria and Related Processes
14.1 AT&T-21STATE has designated and posted, to AT&T CLEC Online website, the Wire Centers where it contends the
thresholds for DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity UNE Loops (as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4) and

Contract Id: 4352361
Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-21STATE
Page 21 of 24
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 3Q14 - CLEC ICA – 07/14/14
Rule 51.319(a)(5) and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Non-Impaired Wire Centers as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i)
and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii)) have been met.
14.2 Commission-approved Wire Center Lists:
14.2.1 In states where the Commission has already determined that a Wire Center is properly designated as a
Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule 51.319(a)(5), Rule
51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), CLEC may no longer self-certify or request DS1/DS3 High-
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
declassified by the non-impairment status of the Wire Center in such Wire Center.
14.3 Wire Center Lists Pending Commission Approval:
14.3.1 In states where the Commission has not previously determined, in any proceeding, that a Wire Center is
properly designated as a Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), AT&T-21STATE’s designations shall be treated
as controlling (even if CLEC believes the list is inaccurate) for purposes of transition and ordering unless
CLEC provides a self-certification as outlined below. If a CLEC withdraws its self-certification after a dispute
has been filed with the Commission, but before the Commission has made a determination regarding the
wire center designation, the wire center designation(s) that were the subject of the dispute will be treated as
though the Commission approved AT&T-21STATE’s designations.
14.4 Self-Certifications:
14.4.1 CLEC shall perform a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine whether, to the best of CLEC’s knowledge,
the Wire Center meets the non-impairment thresholds as set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii).
14.4.2 If, based on its reasonably diligent inquiry, the CLEC disputes the AT&T-21STATE Wire Center non-
impairment designation, the CLEC will provide a self-certification to AT&T-21STATE identifying the Wire
Center(s) for which it is self-certifying. To self-certify, CLEC can send a letter to AT&T-21STATE claiming
Self Certification or CLEC may elect to self-certify using a written or electronic notification sent to AT&T-
21STATE.
14.4.3 If CLEC makes such a self-certification, and CLEC is otherwise entitled to the ordered element under the
Agreement, then AT&T-21STATE shall provision the requested facilities in accordance with CLEC’s order
and within AT&T-21STATE’s standard ordering interval applicable to such facilities.
14.4.4 If AT&T-21STATE in error rejects CLEC orders, where CLEC has provided self certification in accordance
with this Section of this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE will modify its systems to accept such orders within a
reasonable period of time after receipt of CLEC notification to AT&T-21STATE.
14.4.5 CLEC may not submit a self-certification for a Wire Center after the transition period for the DS1/DS3 UNE
Loops and/or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport impacted by the
designation of the Wire Center has passed.
14.5 CLEC may not self-certify that it is entitled to obtain Unbundled DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or Unbundled DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport at a location where CLEC has met the volume Cap set forth in Sections 8.1.3.4.4 above and
8.1.3.5.4 above (for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops) and 9.1.5.3 above and 9.1.5.2 above (for DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport).
14.6 Until CLEC provides a self-certification for High-Capacity UNE Loops and/or Transport for such Wire Center
designations, CLEC will not submit High Capacity UNE Loop and/or Transport orders based on the Wire Center
designation, and if no self-certification is provided will transition any remaining Embedded Base of DS1 and DS3
UNE Loop and Transport and Dark Fiber Transport arrangements affected by the designation by disconnecting or
transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within thirty (30) calendar days of executing this
Agreement. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or arrangement within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, AT&T-21STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning billing CLEC the equivalent special
access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the Transitional Rates.

14.7 AT&T-21STATE will update the AT&T CLEC Online website posted list and will advise CLECs of such posting via
Accessible Letter, which term for the purposes of this Section above of this Agreement shall be deemed to mean an
Accessible Letter issued after the Effective Date of this Agreement, as set forth in this Section 14.0 above of this
Agreement.
14.8 If it desires to do so, AT&T-21STATE can dispute the self-certification and associated CLEC orders for facilities
pursuant to the following procedures:
14.8.1 AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of its intent to dispute CLEC’s self-certification within thirty (30) calendar
days of CLEC’s self-certification or within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date of this Agreement,
whichever is later.
14.8.2 AT&T-21STATE will file the dispute for resolution with the state Commission within sixty (60) calendar days
of CLEC’s self-certification or within sixty (60) calendar days of the Effective Date of this Agreement,
whichever is later.
14.8.3 AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the filing of such a dispute via Accessible Letter.
14.8.4 If the self-certification dispute is filed with the state Commission for resolution, the Parties will not oppose
requests for intervention by other CLECs if such request is related to the disputed Wire Center
designation(s). The Parties agree to urge the state Commission to adopt a case schedule resulting in the
prompt resolution of the dispute.
14.9 During the timeframe of any dispute resolution proceeding, AT&T-21STATE shall continue to provide the High-
Capacity UNE Loop or Transport facility in question to CLEC at the rates in the Pricing Schedule.
14.10 If CLEC withdraws its self-certification, or if the state Commission determines through arbitration or otherwise that
CLEC was not entitled to the provisioned DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport under Section 251, the rates paid by CLEC for the affected UNE Loop or Transport shall be
subject to true-up as follows:
14.10.1 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-21STATE prior to March 11, 2005 and
14.10.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed prior to March 11, 2005,
14.10.2.1 CLEC will provide a true-up calculated using a beginning date of March 11, 2005 based on the
FCC transitional rates which are the rates in effect at the time of the non-impairment
designations plus fifteen percent (15%) (“Transitional Rates”). If affected UNE Loops/Transport
element(s) remain in place after the end of the initial TRRO transition period, CLEC will also
provide a true-up for the period after the end of initial TRRO transition period calculated using
the equivalent special access rates during the period between the end of the initial transition
period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no equivalent special access rate exists,
a true-up will be determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access rate/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply until the facility has
been transitioned.
14.10.2.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed after March 11, 2005, CLEC will
provide a true-up to an equivalent special access rate as of the later of the date billing began for
the provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-21STATE’s Notice of non-
impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the
Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special access rate/Transitional Rates will
continue to apply until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-21STATE after March 11, 2005:
14.10.2.3.1 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered before AT&T-21STATE’s Wire
Center designation,
14.10.2.3.1.1 if the applicable transition period is within the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 15.0 below of this Agreement, CLEC will

provide a true-up during the period between the date that is thirty (30)
calendar days after AT&T-21STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and
the date the circuit is transitioned to the Transitional Rates.
14.10.2.3.1.2 if the applicable transition period is after the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 14.1 above of this Agreement has
expired, CLEC will provide a true-up based on the Transitional Rates
between the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-
21STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and the end of the applicable
transition period described in Section 15.1 below and the equivalent
special access rates during the period between the end of the initial
transition period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no
equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined
using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply
until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3.2 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered after AT&T-21STATE’s Wire
Center designation, CLEC will provide a true-up for the affected UNE
Loop/Transport element(s) to an equivalent special access rate for the affected
UNE Loop/Transport element(s) as of the later of the date billing began for the
provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-21STATE’s Notice of
non-impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be
determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates will continue to apply until the facility has been
transitioned.
14.10.3 In the event of a dispute following CLEC’s Self-Certification, upon request by the Commission or CLEC,
AT&T-21STATE will make available, subject to the appropriate state or federal protective order, and other
reasonable safeguards, all documentation and all data upon which AT&T-21STATE intends to rely, which
will include the detailed business line information for the AT&T-21STATE Wire Center or centers that are
the subject of the dispute.
15.0 Future Wire Center Designations
15.1 The parties recognize that Wire Centers that AT&T-21STATE had not designated as meeting the FCC’s non-
impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005, may meet those thresholds in the future. In the event that a Wire
Center that is not currently designated as meeting one (1) or more of the FCC’s non-impairment thresholds, meets
one (1) or more of these thresholds at a later date, AT&T-21STATE may add the Wire Center to the list of
designated Wire Centers and the Parties will use the following process:
15.1.1 AT&T-21STATE may update the Wire Center list as changes occur.
15.1.2 To designate a Wire Center that had previously not met one (1) or more of the FCC’s impairment thresholds
but subsequently does so, AT&T-21STATE will provide notification to CLEC via Accessible Letter and by a
posting on AT&T CLEC Online website.
15.1.3 AT&T-21STATE will continue to accept CLEC orders for impacted DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport without requiring CLEC self-certification for
thirty (30) calendar days after the date the Accessible Letter is issued.
15.1.4 In the event the CLEC disagrees with AT&T-21STATE’s determination, CLEC will have sixty (60) calendar
days from the issuance of the Accessible Letter to dispute AT&T-21STATE’s Wire Center determination by
providing a self-certification to AT&T-21STATE.
15.1.5 If the CLEC does not use the self-certification process described in Section 15.1.4 above to self-certify
against AT&T-21STATE’s Wire Center designation within sixty (60) calendar days of the issuance of the
Accessible Letter, CLEC must transition all circuits that have been declassified by the Wire Center

designation(s) by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within
thirty (30) calendar days ending on the ninetieth (90th) day after the issuance of the Accessible Letter
providing the Wire Center designation of non-impairment; no additional notification from AT&T-21STATE
will be required. CLEC may not obtain new DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or
Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport in Wire Centers and/or Routes where such circuits have been declassified
during the applicable transition period. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or
arrangement within such thirty (30) day period, AT&T-21STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning
billing CLEC the equivalent special access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be
determined using the transitional rates set forth in Section 15.2 below.
15.1.6 If CLEC does provide self-certification to dispute AT&T-21STATE’s designation determination within sixty
(60) calendar days of the issuance of the Accessible Letter, AT&T-21STATE may dispute CLEC’s self-
certification as described in Section 14.8 above of this Agreement and AT&T-21STATE will accept and
provision the applicable UNE Loop and Transport orders for the CLEC providing the self certification during
a dispute resolution process.
15.2 During the applicable transition period, the transition rates paid will be rates in effect at the time of the non-
impairment designations plus fifteen percent (15%).
16.0 Transition Procedures of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport Arrangements Impacted by Wire Center Designation(s)
16.1 The provisions of Section 14.1 above of this Attachment shall apply to the transition of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements impacted by Wire Center
designation(s). As outlined in Section 14.1 above of this Attachment, requested transitions of DS1/DS3 High
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall be
performed in a manner that reasonably minimizes the disruption or degradation to CLEC’s End User’s service, and all
applicable charges shall apply. Cross-connects provided by AT&T-21STATE in conjunction with such UNE Loops
and/or Transport shall be billed at applicable wholesale rates (e.g., prior to transition, cross connects will be billed at
transitional rates, after transition, if conversion is to an access product, cross connects will be billed at applicable
access rates). Cross-connects that are not associated with such transitioned DS1/DS3 High-Capacity UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall not be re-priced.
16.2 AT&T-21STATE will process CLEC orders for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport, or Dark Fiber
Transport conversion or disconnection. AT&T-21STATE will not convert or disconnect these services prior to the
end of the applicable transitional period unless specifically requested by the CLEC; however, CLEC is responsible for
ensuring that it submits timely orders in order to complete the transition by the end of applicable transitional period in
an orderly manner.
16.3 A Building that is served by both an impaired Wire Center and a non impaired Wire Center and that is not located in
the serving area for the non-impaired Wire Center will continue to have affected elements available from the impaired
Wire Center and support incremental moves, adds, and changes otherwise permitted by the Agreement, as
amended.
16.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at the end
of the applicable transitional period, unless CLEC has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as
applicable, under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement, and if CLEC and AT&T-21STATE have failed to reach
agreement under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement as to a substitute service arrangement or element, then
AT&T-21STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark
Fiber Dedicated Transport, whether previously provided alone or in combination with or as part of any other
arrangement, or convert the subject element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other
arrangement to an analogous resale or access service, if available, at rates applicable to such analogous service or
arrangement.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 AT&T-21STATE will make available xDSL Loops and xDSL/Unbundled Copper Subloop (UCSL) Subloops for the
provision of xDSL-based services or line splitting arrangements provided by CLEC in accordance with the FCC’s
Triennial Review Order and associated lawful and effective implementing rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(i)-(iv) and
(b)(1), as such rules may be modified from time to time.
2.0 General Provisions
2.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide xDSL Loops and xDSL/UCSL Subloops for CLEC to deploy xDSL technologies
presumed acceptable for deployment or non-standard xDSL technologies as defined in this Agreement and as
provided for under the applicable lawful and effective FCC rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.230, as such rule may be modified
from time to time.
2.2 AT&T-21STATE will not guarantee that an xDSL Loop or xDSL/UCSL Subloops ordered by CLEC will perform as
desired by CLEC for xDSL based services, but will guarantee that Loops will be provisioned to meet basic metallic
Loop parameters, including continuity and pair balance. CLEC shall designate on its Local Service Request (LSR),
at CLEC’s sole option, what Loop conditioning AT&T-21STATE is to perform in provisioning the order.
2.3 The Parties shall comply with the FCC’s lawful and effective spectrum management rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.231-233, as
such rules may be modified from time to time. Refer to AT&T CLEC Online website for specific processes addressing
Spectrum Management.
2.4 Maintenance, Repair and Testing:
2.4.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Maintenance Repair and Testing in accordance with the lawful and effective
requirements of 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(iv) and as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website and within
Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems (OSS).
2.4.2 Line and Station Transfer (LST): For a loop currently in service where trouble ticket resolution has identified
that excessive bridged tap(s), load coil(s) and/or repeater(s) are on the loop and transferring to a new loop
is a solution identified by AT&T-12STATE to resolve a trouble, AT&T-12STATE, at its sole option, may
perform an LST to resolve the identified trouble. In the event that a request for conditioning is received from
the CLEC on a loop currently in service and AT&T-12STATE determines that an LST can be performed, the
AT&T-12STATE LOC will contact the CLEC to inform it of the decision to perform an LST in lieu of CLEC’s
requested conditioning. In such case, the charge for the LST set forth in the Pricing Schedule shall apply in
lieu of any loop conditioning charges which would have applied had the requested conditioning been
performed. If, however, the LST does not resolve the reported trouble and the trouble is determined to be
an AT&T-12STATE network-related problem, then CLEC will not be charged the LST rate or for AT&T-
12STATE’s resolution of the trouble. If, however, the trouble is found not to be an AT&T-12STATE network-
related problem, then CLEC shall pay the Maintenance of Service charges referenced in the Pricing
Schedule, in addition to the applicable LST charge.
3.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
3.1 Loop Makeup Information and Ordering:
3.1.1 At the CLEC’s request, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to its Loop
makeup information as it exists in AT&T-21STATE’s database and records via:

3.3.2 All modifications for Loop Conditioning/Line Conditioning in this section will be performed at the rates set
forth in the Pricing Schedule.
3.3.3 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Line Conditioning on 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops, as requested by CLEC,
even in instances where AT&T-21STATE does not provide advanced services to the End User on that
251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop.
3.3.4 AT&T-21STATE will not modify a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop in such a way that it no longer meets the
technical parameters of the original 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop type e.g., voice grade, etc., being ordered.
3.3.5 In AT&T-12STATE (i) If load coils, repeaters or excessive bridged tap are present on a loop less than
12,000 feet in actual loop length, conditioning to remove these elements will be performed without request;
(ii) if the loop qualification indicates conditioning is available on a loop that is 12,000 feet in actual loop
length or greater, CLEC may request that no conditioning be performed or that AT&T-12STATE perform
some or all of the available loop conditioning to remove excessive bridged tap, load coils and/or repeaters at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may obtain loop conditioning information according to the
terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online website; incorporated herein by reference, as
may be modified from time to time.
3.3.6 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will remove load coils only on copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops
that are equal to or less than eighteen thousand (18,000) feet in length. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-

equal to or less than 18,000 feet or, if there is no copper feeder, the distance from the remote terminal (RT)
to the End User is equal to or less than 18,000 feet.
3.3.7 For any copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop being ordered by CLEC which has over six thousand (6,000) feet
of combined bridged tap will be modified, upon request from CLEC, so that the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
will have a maximum of six thousand (6,000) feet of bridged tap. This modification will be performed at no
additional charge to CLEC. In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE loop conditioning orders that require
the removal of bridged tap that serves no network design purpose on a copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
that will result in a combined total of bridged tap between two thousand five hundred (2,500) and six
thousand (6,000) feet will be performed at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may request
removal of any unnecessary and non-Excessive bridged tap (bridged tap between zero (0) and two
thousand five hundred (2,500) feet which serves no network design purpose), at rates pursuant to AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Special Construction (SC) Process, (which is a part of the service
inquiry process), as mutually agreed to by the Parties.
3.3.8 If CLEC requests Unbundled Loop Modification (ULM) on a reserved facility for a new 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop order, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE may perform a pair change and provision a different
251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility in lieu of the reserved facility with ULM if feasible. The 251(c)(3)
Unbundled Loop provisioned will meet or exceed specifications of the requested 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
facility as modified. CLEC will not be charged for ULM if a different 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop is
provisioned. For 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops that require a Design Layout Report (DLR) or its equivalent,
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9 STATE will provide LMU detail of the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
provisioned.
3.3.9 CLEC shall request 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop make up information pursuant to this Attachment prior to
submitting a Service Inquiry, in accordance to the terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online

3.3.10 When requesting ULM for a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has
previously provisioned for CLEC, CLEC will submit a Service Inquiry to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE. If a spare 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility that meets the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop modification
specifications requested by CLEC is available at the location for which the ULM was requested, CLEC will
have the option to change the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility to the qualifying spare facility rather than to
provide ULM. In the event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE changes the 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop facility in lieu of providing ULM, CLEC will not be charged for ULM but will only be charged the service
order charges for submitting an order.
3.4 Loops and Subloops available under this Attachment are further identified in the Pricing Schedule and AT&T CLEC
Online website.
3.5 Pricing/Rates:

Page 3 of 3
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Coordinated Hot Cut (CHC) provided by AT&T-12STATE and for
Order Coordination (OC) and Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) provided by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Conversion of Service” means the matching of the disconnect of one Telecommunications product or service with
the installation of another Telecommunications product or service.
2.2 “Designated Installation” means an installation of service occurring at a specific time of day as specified.
3.0 CHC and OC (CHC/OC) Service Description
3.1 CHC/OC is an optional manual service offering that permits CLEC to request a Designated Installation and/or
Conversion of Service during or after normal business hours.
3.2 CHC/OC allows the Parties to coordinate the installation of the SL2 Loops (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE),
Unbundled Digital Loops and other Loops where CHC/OC may be purchased as an option, to CLEC’s facilities in
order to limit the time an End User may be without service. CHC/OC is available when the Loop is provisioned over
an existing circuit that is currently providing service to the End User. CHC/OC for physical conversions will be
scheduled at AT&T-21STATE’s discretion during normal working hours on the committed due date.
3.3 CLEC will initiate the beginning of a CHC/OC by contacting the appropriate coordination center. This special request
enables CLEC to schedule and coordinate particular provisioning requirements with AT&T-21STATE.
3.4 AT&T-21STATE may limit the number of service orders that can be coordinated based on workload and resources
available. AT&T-21STATE shall approve the CHC/OC request on a non-discriminatory basis, by requesting carrier,
and on a first come first served basis.
3.5 AT&T-21STATE reserves the right to suspend the availability of CHC/OC service during unanticipated heavy
workload/activity periods. Heavy workload includes any unanticipated volume of work that impacts AT&T-
21STATE’s ability to provide its baseline service. Where time permits, AT&T-21STATE will make every effort to
notify CLEC when such unanticipated activities occur.
4.0 CHC/OC Pricing
4.1 CHC/OC is a time sensitive labor operation. Total charges are determined by a number of factors including the
volume of lines, day of the week, and the time of day requested for the coordinated cut.
4.2 When CLEC orders CHC/OC service, AT&T-21STATE shall charge and CLEC agrees to pay for CHC/OC service at
the “additional labor” or “Time and Material” rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
4.3 In the event AT&T-21STATE fails to meet a CHC/OC service commitment for reasons within the control of AT&T-
21STATE, AT&T-21STATE will not charge CLEC a CHC/OC service charge. However, in the event AT&T-
21STATE misses a CHC/OC service commitment due to reasons outside of AT&T-21STATE’s control, including but
not limited to actions of CLEC, its agent or End User, the CHC/OC service charge will still apply. For example, if
CLEC requests any change to an order with CHC/OC service including, but not limited to, no access to the CLEC’s
End User’s premises, or CLEC/End User not ready to proceed with the order, the CHC/OC service charge will apply
and AT&T-21STATE will not be obligated to ensure a CHC/OC for that order.
5.0 Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Only
5.1 OC-TS is a chargeable option for all Loops except Unbundled Copper Loops (UCL) and is billed in addition to the OC
charge. CLEC may specify a time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (local time) Monday through Friday, excluding
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s holidays. If CLEC specifies a time outside this window, or selects a time
or quantity of loops that requires AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE technicians to work outside normal work
hours, overtime charges will apply in addition to the OC and OC-TS charges. Overtime charges will be applied
based on the amount of overtime worked and in accordance with the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. The OC-
TS charges for an order due on the same day at the same location will be applied on a per LSR basis.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Resale Services provided by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC.
1.2 To the extent required by Section 251(c)(4) of the Act, AT&T-21STATE shall make available to CLEC for resale at
wholesale rates Telecommunications Services that AT&T-21STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not
Telecommunications Carriers.
1.3 Each state-specific avoided cost discount applicable to rates paid by CLEC for the resale of Telecommunications
Services is referred to herein as a Resale Discount. Where available, Resale Discounts are listed in the Pricing
Schedule; if not listed in the Pricing Schedule, the Resale Discount(s) and/or rate(s) as stated or reflected in the
applicable Tariff shall apply.
1.4 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific Tariff(s) shall govern the terms, conditions and
charges associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, with the exception of any
resale restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply.
Use limitations shall be in parity with services offered by AT&T-21STATE to its End Users.
1.5 Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is
effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Special Needs Services” means services for the physically disabled as defined in state-specific Tariffs.
2.2 “Tariff” means the most current state-specific retail and, where available, resale tariff(s) and/or Guidebook(s) (the
latter as posted on the AT&T CLEC Online website).
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are concurrently offered to AT&T-21STATE’s End Users at
retail.
3.2 AT&T-21STATE has no obligation to make services available at the Resale Discount to CLEC for its own use or for
the use of one or more of its parent, Affiliates, subsidiaries or similarly-related entities. CLEC shall not use any
Resale Service to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-21STATE’s corresponding retail Tariff(s).
Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Service to provide access or interconnection services to itself,
interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), or other Telecommunications
providers; provided, however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local Exchange telephone service to
access IXCs, wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers.
3.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale at the Resale Discount pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of
the state-specific retail Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that End User’s existing location, both at the time of grandfathering.
3.4 CLEC shall only sell Plexar, Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is being
offered.
3.5 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-21STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of a
service by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
3.6 CLEC shall only resell services provided under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to whom AT&T-
21STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).

3.6.1 Where available for Resale in accordance with state-specific Tariffs, CLEC may resell Special Needs
Services and/or low income assistance services (e.g., LifeLine and Link-Up) to End Users who are eligible
for each such service. To the extent CLEC resells services that require certification on the part of the End
User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as
established by the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
3.6.2 CLEC as a reseller of Lifeline and Link-up Services hereby certifies that it has and will comply with the FCC
requirements governing the Lifeline and Link-Up programs as set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 54.417(a) and (b).
This includes the requirements set forth in AT&T’s GSST, Sections A3.31 and A4.4.7.
3.6.3 CLEC shall maintain documentation of FCC or applicable state eligibility to prove compliance with the
Lifeline and Link-Up programs for the three (3) full preceding calendar years, and CLEC shall provide such
documentation to the FCC or its Administrator upon request.
3.6.3.1 CLEC hereby permits AT&T to provide the FCC or its Administrator, USAC, or any Commission
information concerning CLEC’s participation in Lifeline and Link-Up programs.
3.6.4 AT&T-21STATE will provide the Lifeline Service to CLEC at the applicable Lifeline Local Exchange Tariff or
Guidebook rate, less an additional CLEC state discount as specified in the applicable Pricing Schedule.
AT&T-21STATE is the entity eligible to apply to and receive support from the applicable state Universal
Service Fund and the Federal Universal Service Fund for the Lifeline Service.
3.7 When ordering services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-21STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original end user service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End Users for such offering or promotion. AT&T-21STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each promotion
per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
3.8 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for Resale, whether
at the Resale Discount or otherwise; provided, however, that AT&T-21STATE shall offer Short-Term Promotions for
Resale at no Resale Discount in a particular state if and only to the extent required by Commission order in that
state.
3.9 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this
Attachment.
3.10 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local Exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
3.11 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have thirty (30)
calendar days to correct the violation and notify AT&T-21STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected.
AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC a sum equal to:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for
the stated violation; and
(ii) the actual revenues CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation, whichever
is greater.
Should CLEC dispute the stated violation, CLEC must notify AT&T-21STATE in writing of the specific details and
reasons for its dispute within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Resale Notice from AT&T-21STATE and
comply with the Dispute Resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions (“GT&C”) of the Agreement
(“Dispute Resolution provisions”). Resolution of any dispute under this Attachment shall also be conducted in
compliance with the Dispute Resolution provisions in the GT&C.

3.12 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption (or
resale to similarly-situated end users) of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof (including, without limitation, the wholesale discount, if any,
associated with such resale). Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by both Parties and
approval by the Commission(s).
3.13 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-21STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-21STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-21STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
4.0 Responsibilities of Parties
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-21STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-21STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations, and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.
4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-21STATE is free to reclaim the End
User or process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-21STATE maintenance
center(s) twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, or otherwise shall be in parity with the ability offered
by AT&T-21STATE to its End Users. CLEC will be assigned Maintenance Center(s) when CLEC’s initial service
agreements are made. CLEC End Users calling AT&T-21STATE will be referred to CLEC at the telephone
number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to authorize CLEC to repair,
maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-21STATE’s network facilities, including without limitation those on End User
premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ activation of Call Trace and annoying call complaints shall be handled by the AT&T-21STATE
operations centers responsible for handling such requests. AT&T-21STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End
Users to provide call records to the proper authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case
involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through
CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against
any claim, loss or damage arising from providing this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the
corrective action necessary with its End User who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-
21STATE taking corrective action, up to and including disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-21STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-21STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the GT&Cs of the Agreement.
5.0 Billing and Payment of Rates and Charges

but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.

Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
5.1.1 Interexchange carried traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services
messages) received by AT&T-21STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as
unbillable and will not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those
messages to the carrier indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be
billed by AT&T-21STATE.
5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall not be responsible for the manner in which utilization of Resale Services or the associated
charges are allocated to End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC
under this Attachment will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for calling card, collect, or third number
billed calls (Alternately Billed Traffic or “ABT”) or toll and information services (for example, 900 calls), CLEC
must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this Attachment and pay any
applicable charges. It is the responsibility of CLEC to order the appropriate toll restriction or blocking on
lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for certain types of calls,
including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Express Call Completion. Depending on
the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may bypass
blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any charges
associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that bypass
blocking systems.

provisions of Section 276 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and are not eligible for the Resale Discount
unless required by State Commission order(s). However, given certain billing system limitations, the Resale Discount
may be applied to Payphone Services, unless and until AT&T-21STATE is able to modify its billing system, and
AT&T-21STATE may issue true-up bills in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 12.19 of the General
Terms and Conditions.

1.0 Pricing Schedule
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the pricing terms and conditions. The rate tables included in this Attachment may be
divided into categories. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any
of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
1.2 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
1.2.1 Certain of the current rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established by
the Commission (“Commission-established “Current Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement that are
not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.2, or that are not marked as interim or as
“TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Current Rates. If, during the Term
of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Current Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable (i.e., not an order
or docket relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration) to the
Interconnection Services, either Party may provide written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party,
after the effective date of such order, that it wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim
Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and supersede the Commission-established Current Rate(s) already
set forth in this Agreement. Following such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for
any written amendment or further Commission action, CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC shall pay) the Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Section 1.2.1.1
below and Section 1.2.1.3 below, and the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as
provided in Section 1.2.1.1 below and Section 1.2.1.3 below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a
conforming amendment which shall reflect that the Commission-established Current Rate(s) were replaced
by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval. In addition, as
soon as is reasonably practicable after such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party
any adjustments that are necessary to reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the
Parties as provided:
1.2.1.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective
date of any such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the
effective date of the order, and AT&T-21STATE will issue any adjustments that are appropriate
(e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified
Rate(s) with the Commission-established current Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of
the order, in accordance herewith.
1.2.1.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.2.1.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.2 above, but not within
ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be
deemed effective between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified
Rate(s) into the Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is
approved or is deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, on a
prospective basis only, upon the amendment effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further,
the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established
Current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) if the terms and conditions of this Section 1.2 above were
not part of an approved and effective agreement between the Parties at the time the order became
effective, either Party may still give a Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be
effective as of the date the Parties’ Agreement (containing this Section 1.2,) becomes effective
(following the date the Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the
Commission) and shall apply, beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis
only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Commission-established current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.2 above.

1.3 Replacement of Interim Rates
1.3.1 Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Interconnection Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party
may, within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written
notice (“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the new Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Interim Rate counterpart(s) in this
Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any formal amendment or
further Commission action, AT&T-21STATE will update CLEC’s billing tables to replace the Current Interim
Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the Replacement Rate Notice.
Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect such Replacement Rates and
shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.3.2 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such
order, then the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T-21STATE
will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments)
to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Interim Rates for the period after the effective date
of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.3.3 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the Interim
Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.3.4 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.3 above, but not within ninety (90)
calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is deemed to
have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective date, on a
prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of such
amendment.
1.3.5 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.3 above were not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply, beginning
on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from
replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period
prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above.
1.4 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.4.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Pricing Schedule and Agreement, in the event that any other
CLEC should seek to adopt the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the
Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the current and/or interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of
the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become effective between AT&T-21STATE and the Adopting
CLEC (i.e., following the date the Commission approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting
CLEC’s Section 252(i) adoption (“MFN Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this
Agreement shall entitle an Adopting CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement
to any date prior to the MFN Effective Date and any adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such
claim hereunder.
1.4.2 AT&T-21STATE obligation, under this Agreement, per the GT&C is to only provide Interconnection Services
for which complete rates, terms and conditions are contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent
CLEC orders a product or service for which there are not complete rates, terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, AT&T-21STATE may reject the order. CLEC must amend this Agreement to allow ordering

Contract Id: 4352361
Pricing Schedule/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 5
ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
of products and services for which complete rates, terms and conditions did not exist as of the Effective
Date of the Agreement to the extent such product or service is still available at the time of the request. In
the event that CLEC orders, and AT&T-21STATE provisions, a product or service to CLEC for which there
are not complete rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees that
one of the following will occur:
1.4.3 CLEC shall pay for the product or service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s
applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the product or service or, to the extent there are no tariff rates, terms or
conditions available for the product or service in the applicable state, then CLEC shall pay for the product or
service at AT&T-21STATE’s current generic contract rate for the product or service set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s applicable state-specific generic Pricing Sheet as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website;
or
1.4.4 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.4.3 above, and AT&T-
21STATE may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of the product or
service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement as set
forth in this Section 1.4.2 above. If CLEC and AT&T-21STATE cannot agree on rates, terms, and
conditions either Party may institute the Dispute Resolution provisions as contained in the GT&Cs.
1.4.5 AT&T-21STATE’s provisioning of orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.4.2 above, and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-21STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such products and/or services.
1.4.6 Where the rate for an AT&T-21STATE Interconnection Service is identified as a tariffed rate, any changes
to the tariff rate shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement. The issuance of a Commission
Order approving such rate change shall be the only Notice required under this Agreement. Provided
however, should a tariff or tariff rate, incorporated into this Agreement, be withdrawn or invalidated in any
way during the term of this Agreement, the last rate in effect at the time of such withdrawal or invalidation
shall continue to apply during the remaining term of this Agreement.
1.4.7 The Resale Discount applicable to purchases of Resold Services in each State is the current Commission-
approved rate. Any Commission approved or ordered change in the Resale discount for Resold Services
shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement for the state in which such Commission approves or
orders the change. The issuance of the Commission Order approving such change shall be the only Notice
required under this Agreement.
1.5 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.5.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or “TBD” or no rate is
shown, the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T-
21STATE for that Interconnection Service and incorporated into AT&T-21STATE’s current state-specific
Generic Pricing Sheet as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website, that rate(s) (“Established Rate”)
shall automatically apply to the Interconnection Service provided under this Agreement back to the Effective
Date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T-21STATE provisioned for that
Interconnection Service without the need for any additional modification(s) to this Agreement or further
Commission action. AT&T-21STATE shall provide Written Notice to CLEC of the application of the rate,
price or charge that has been established, and the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate, and the Established Rate will be deemed effective between the
Parties as of the Effective Date of the Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment,
which shall reflect the Established Rate that applies to such Product or Service pursuant to this Section 1.5
above, and shall submit such Amendment to the State Commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is
reasonably practicable after such Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T-21STATE shall bill CLEC to
reflect the application of the Established Rate retroactively to the Effective Date of the Agreement between

ONVOY, LLC
Version: 1Q14 - CLEC ICA – 03/28/14
1.5.2 AT&T-21STATE’s provisioning of such orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.5 above and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-21STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such Interconnection Services.
1.6 Recurring Charges
1.6.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Sheet, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be defined
as a thirty (30) day calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Interconnection Services will
be one (1) month. After the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The
minimum term for Interconnection Services, if applicable, will be specified in the rate tables included in this
Attachment.
1.6.2 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T-21STATE will first compute the mileage using the
V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No 4.
When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T-21STATE will round up to the next whole mile
before determining the mileage and applying rates.
1.7 Non-Recurring Charges:
1.7.1 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“non-recurring charges”.
1.7.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there may be non-recurring charges for each 251(c)(3) UNE.
1.7.3 When CLEC converts an End-User currently receiving non-complex service from AT&T-21STATE, without
any facilities rearrangements to AT&T-21STATE’s network, the normal service order charges and/or
nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
1.7.4 CLEC shall pay the applicable service order processing/administration charge for each service order
submitted by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement,
change, or record order.
1.7.5 In some cases, Commissions have ordered AT&T-21STATE to separate disconnect costs and installation
costs into two separate nonrecurring charges. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted in this Agreement, the
Commission-ordered disconnect charges will be applied at the time the disconnect activity is performed by
AT&T-21STATE, regardless of whether or not a disconnect order is issued by CLEC.
1.7.6 Time and Material charges, also known as Additional Labor Charges, are defined in the Price Sheet
contained herein.
1.7.7 Loop Zone charges are defined in the Price Sheet contained herein.
1.8 AT&T CALIFORNIA only:
1.8.1 The Pricing Sheet contained in this Agreement contains both zone and statewide rates for many of the Rate
Element Descriptions contained within the Unbundled Exchange Access Loop Product. CLEC must select
either zone rates or statewide rates for these rate elements upon the establishment of the BAN(s) for CLEC
in California.
1.8.1.1 CLEC will indicate on the WEST - UNE/UNE-P/LWC™/Commercial Agreements BAN REQUEST
FORM which type of rates that the CLEC wants to be billed: Zone or Statewide. The form is
provided to CLEC in the West Implementation Checklist for Facility-Based/LWC/Resale
package.
1.8.1.2 Once CLEC selects either the zone or statewide rate, that rate type will remain for the life of the
contract.
