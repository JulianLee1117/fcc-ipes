Re: Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Held by Flowroute Inc.;
WC Docket No. 16-265
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Flowroute Inc. (“Flowroute”), pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(iv)(A) of the Commission’s
rules,1 respectfully notifies the Commission of changes to the information associated with its
authorization to obtain numbering resources2 resulting from the acquisition by West Corporation
(“West”) of ultimate control of Flowroute and Flowroute’s wholly owned subsidiary Flowroute
CLEC Inc. (“Flowroute CLEC” and together with Flowroute and West, the “Parties”).3 The
Commission approved this transfer of control of Flowroute and Flowroute CLEC to West on
August 10, 2018,4 and the transaction was consummated on August 15, 2018.
Flowroute currently holds authorization to obtain numbering resources from the
Numbering Administrator as an interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) provider.5
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3)(iv)(A).
2 Notice of Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization Granted, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd
11681 (2016) (“2016 Public Notice”); see also Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization
Application Filed by Flowroute Inc. Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3) of the Commission’s Rules,
WC Docket No. 16-265 (Aug. 15, 2016) (“Flowroute Application”).
3 On June 29, 2018, Flowroute and West submitted to the Commission a Joint Application for
Consent to Transfer Control of International Authorization Pursuant to Section 214 of the
Communications Act. See File No. ITC-T/C-20180629-00141.
4 International Authorizations Granted, Public Notice, Report No. TEL-01921, DA No. 18-855
(rel. Aug. 16, 2018).
5 See 2016 Public Notice.

Pursuant to the Commission’s numbering policies and rules, the Parties submit this letter for
informational purposes to ensure the accuracy of the Commission’s records in connection with
Flowroute’s numbering authorization.
I. INFORMATION REQUIRED BY SECTION 52.15(g)
Section 52.15(g)(1). The Commission’s rules require that an applicant for numbering
resources include in its application any operating company numbers (“OCNs”) its parent company
may hold. As a result of the transaction, Flowroute is now a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of
West, and a direct subsidiary of West Telecom Services, LLC (“West Telecom”). The Parties
hereby submit to the Commission the OCNs held by West Telecom, attached hereto as Attachment
A.
Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(F). The transaction resulted only in a change in the ownership of
Flowroute, and did not affect the identity of Flowroute’s key management and technical personnel,
which are listed below and were set forth in the Flowroute Application.6
Key Personnel: Bayan Towfiq, Chief Executive Officer
Eric Harber, Chief Operating Officer
Justin Grow, Director Carrier Operations
Jeff Heinen, Vice President of Engineering
Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(B). Flowroute acknowledges that the numbering authorization it
holds is subject to compliance with applicable Commission numbering rules, numbering authority
delegated to the states, and industry guidelines and practices. Flowroute certifies that it currently
complies with such rules and will continue to do so under the ultimate control of West.
Section 52.15(g)(3)(iv). As required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(iv), the Parties will continue
to maintain the accuracy of all contact information and certifications in the Flowroute Application
and will file a correction with the Commission within 30 days of any future changes. Flowroute
will also furnish accurate regulatory and numbering contact information to each state commission
when requesting numbers in that state.
