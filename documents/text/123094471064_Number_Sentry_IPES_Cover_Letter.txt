Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Number Sentry,

Number Sentry, LLC respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of
the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from
public inspection, Exhibits C&D to this application in its entirety as confidential because
the documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive “Pricing” information
that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. §
552(b)(4). The information in Exhibit C&D is “of a kind that would not customarily be
released to the public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment
under FOIA. Number Sentry, LLC respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial
competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Exhibits C&D are accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed Under
Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,

0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use Number Sentry, LLC’s proprietary and commercial
