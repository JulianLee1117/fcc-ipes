Request for Confidential Treatment
Dear Ms. Dortch:
NumberBarn, LLC (“NumberBarn” or “Applicant”), by its attorneys and at the advice of the
Commission’s staff, hereby submits the enclosed Supplement to the above-referenced Application for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources (the “Application”). The Application was filed on April 10,
2019.
NumberBarn respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection,
Supplemental Exhibit A to this Supplement in its entirety as confidential because the documents contain
commercially sensitive information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), including identifying information regarding a third party contractor and
contractual terms.
The information in Supplemental Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not customarily be released
to the public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
NumberBarn respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information
were disclosed. Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed Under Seal
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
