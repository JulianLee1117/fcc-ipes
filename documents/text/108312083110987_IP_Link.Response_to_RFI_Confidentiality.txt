RE: WC Docket No. 21-218; Request for Confidential Treatment for Response to
Request for Information filed on August 18, 2021
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, IP Link Telecom,
Inc. (“IP Link”) hereby submits its Response to Request for Information.
IP Link respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibit A to this response in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive information that falls within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The
information in Exhibit A is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
IP Link respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed
Under Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s
rules, IP Link hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT PURSUANT TO
47 CFR § 0.459(b)(1).
IP Link seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit A in its entirety.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(2).

IP Link is submitting the confidential agreements between it and Inteliquent. as
proof of IP Link’s compliance with CALEA.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which IP Link seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors”
as defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibit A consists of
commercial agreements between IP Link and its LEC partner of which contain
proprietary information concerning IP Link’s network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to IP Link’s disadvantage. IP Link has numerous
competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it operates. Detailed
commercial information on operations of the type provided by IP Link could
compromise its position in this highly competitive industry. Release of this
information would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to IP Link.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR
§ 0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use IP Link’s proprietary and commercial information to its
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how IP Link provides
services as well as about IP Link’s commercial agreements with others in the
market that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47
CFR § 0.459(b)(6).
IP Link has not distributed the information in Confidential Exhibit A to the public
or any parties within IP Link or outside IP Link except on a need-to-know basis.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF
THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(7).
IP Link has not previously disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibit A.

8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(8).
IP Link requests that Confidential Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of
ten years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in
Confidential Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT IP LINK BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(9).
The information concerns IP Link’s proprietary network, related to current and
planned operations, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
If you should have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at
your convenience.
Respectfully submitted,
