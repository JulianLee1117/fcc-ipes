Re: CSC Voice, LLC’s Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources &
Request for Confidential Treatment, WC Docket No. 22-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
CSC Voice, LLC (“CSC Voice”) encloses for filing its Application to Obtain Numbering
Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit A, an agreement between CSC
Voice, LLC’s parent CSC Holdings, LLC and the commercial vendor from which it will obtain
interconnection services for VoIP traffic (Confidential Exhibit A or “Service Agreement”).1 The
Application and Service Agreement are sent to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of
the Commission’s Rules.
CSC Voice respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to the Service Agreement. The document contains
trade secrets and commercial, technical, and financial information that falls within Exemption 4
of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).2
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does
not apply to matters that are … (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”3 CSC Voice is voluntarily providing this trade
secret and commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released
to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.4
Moreover, CSC Voice would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Service Agreement was
disclosed.5 Confidential Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header “SUBJECT TO
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
1 Confidential Exhibit A contains an original service agreement, an addendum thereto, and a recent letter from the
vendor confirming the locations covered by the agreement.

REDACTED - FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,6
CSC Voice hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT7
CSC Voice seeks confidential treatment of the Service Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit A.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION8
The Service Agreement is being submitted to the Commission as proof of CSC Voice’s
facilities readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED9
The information for which CSC Voice seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information as described in Section 0.457(d) of the
Commission’s rules.10 The Service Agreement contains trade secrets and proprietary commercial
and technical information relating to the manner in which CSC Voice and its carrier partner
conduct network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION11
The Service Agreement provides detailed information relating to commercial and
operational matters that could be used by competitors to the disadvantage of CSC Voice.
Disclosure of CSC Voice’s confidential information would cause substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM12
Competitors could use the information in the Service Agreement to CSC Voice’s detriment
as they would gain access to sensitive and proprietary information about how CSC Voice provides
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).

services, as well as about CSC Voice’s commercial agreements with others that are not ordinarily
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE13
CSC Voice has made the substance of the Service Agreement and the identity of its carrier
partner known only to those employees who have a need to know the subject matter, and those
employees are aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The Service
Agreement has not been disclosed by CSC Voice to any non-signatories outside CSC Voice except
pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES14
CSC Voice has not previously disclosed the Service Agreement.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE15
CSC Voice requests that the Service Agreement be treated as confidential for a period of
ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in the Service
Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CSC VOICE BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED16
Under applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by
CSC Voice on a confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of
FOIA shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a person
outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial information
in question clearly satisfies this test.
For the foregoing reasons, CSC Voice respectfully requests the Service Agreement be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
