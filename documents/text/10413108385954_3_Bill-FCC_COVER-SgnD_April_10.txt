secrets and commercial information. These all fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of
Information Act (“FOIA”).1 3 Billionaires is voluntarily providing this information, “of a
kind that would customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is
“confidential” under FOIA.2 Moreover, 3 Billionaires would suffer substantial competitive
harm if this information were disclosed.3
As such, Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, Exhibit D and Exhibit E are all marked with the
header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR
PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 3
Billionaires hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR
WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
3 Billionaires seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit(s) A through E to the enclosed
application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of 3 Billionaires’ facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of
the Commission’s rules, 3 Billionaires is submitting the agreement between itself and its
two carrier partners as Exhibit(s) A through E.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR
IS PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which 3 Billionaires seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8
Specifically, Exhibit A describes the agreement between 3 Billionaires and its Switching
Carrier Partner and contains proprietary commercial information concerning the operations
and pricing of 3 Billionaires’ Carrier Partner as well as information germane to 3
Billionaires’ network, services, and operating costs and expenses. In addition, Exhibits B,
C, D & E contain details of Interconnection Agreements containing further proprietary and
commercial information pursuant to its internal operations and pricing
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
All Exhibits contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to 3 Billionaires’ disadvantage. 3 Billionaires has numerous competitors in the
Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations
and commercial information of the type provided by 3 Billionaires could compromise 3

Billionaires’ position in this highly competitive industry. Release of this specific information
would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to 3 Billionaires.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION
COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use 3 Billionaires’ proprietary commercial and operational information to
the detriment of 3 Billionaires’ as they would gain access to sensitive information about how
3 Billionaires provides services as well as about ‘inner workings’ of 3 Billionaires’
commercial agreements with vendors and others that are in the market and are not normally
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
3 Billionaires has not distributed the information in any of its proprietary Exhibits (except for
Exhibit F - KEY MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL in the Public Version) to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
3 Billionaires has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit(s) A through E to the
public or to any third parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
3 Billionaires requests that Exhibit(s) A through E be treated as confidential for a period of
ten years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information contained
within these Exhibits.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT 3 BILLIONAIRES BELIEVES MAY BE
USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.14
The information concerns 3 Billionaires’ proprietary network information, related to its current
as well as future planned commercial and operational information and, as such, is
commercially sensitive, especially in the market which it serves.
