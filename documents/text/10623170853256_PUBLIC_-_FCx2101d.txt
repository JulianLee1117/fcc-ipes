RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc.; Supplemental
Information for Application of IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 21-470
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc. ("IDT Domestic
Telecom") hereby submits supplemental information to its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources which addresses Commission staff's request for additional information regarding outbound
interconnection and 911 compliance.
IDT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the Commission's
Rules/ the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to supplemental
information to the application which contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls
within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3 Moreover, IDT Domestic Telecom would
suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Supplemental Exhibit C is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT- NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, IDT Domestic Telecom hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
IDT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment of supplemental Exhibit C to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
IDT Domestic Telecom is submitting as Exhibit C additional information as proof of IDT Domestic
Telecom's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's Rules.
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.

3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR
CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which IDT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit C describes
and contains proprietary commercial information concerning IDT Domestic Telecom's network,
customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit C contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoiP providers to compromise IDT Domestic Telecom's position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoiP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial information of
the type provided by IDT Domestic Telecom could compromise IDT Domestic Telecom's position in this
highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this information would result in substantial
competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use IDT Domestic Telecom's proprietary commercial and operational information
to IDT Domestic Telecom's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning
IDT Domestic Telecom's commercial agreements, as well as information as to how IDT Domestic
Telecom provides its services. Therefore, disclosure of the supplemental information would result in
significant competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom's carrier partner. This information is not
normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
lOT Domestic Telecom has not distributed the information in Exhibit C to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT
OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
lOT Domestic Telecom does not believe that the supplemental information is available to the public or
that the information has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non-disclosure
agreement regarding their contents.

8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL
SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
IDT Domestic Telecom requests that Exhibit C be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. Any
disclosure of IDT Domestic Telecom's information regarding its outbound interconnection and 911
compliance or their substance would cause competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT IDT DOMESTIC TELECOM BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns IDT Domestic Telecom's proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, IDT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests the supplemental Exhibit C be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
