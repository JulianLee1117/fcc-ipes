REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of MCC Telephony LLC; Application of MCC
Telephony LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15{g)
of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 22-
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.1S{g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 MCC Telephony LLC {"MCC Telephony")
hereby submits its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
MCC Telephony respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the Commission's
Rules/ the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to Exhibit A
to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information
that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act {"FOIA").3 Moreover, MCC Telephony
would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, MCC Telephony hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
MCC Telephony seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
MCC Telephony is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as proof of
MCC Telephony's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g){3){i){D) of the
Commission's Rules.
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for "trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."

Page 2 of 3
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which MCC Telephony seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A
describes the agreement between MCC Telephony and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning MCC Telephony's network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoiP providers to compromise MCC Telephony's position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoiP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by MCC Telephony could compromise MCC Telephony's
position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this information would result
in substantial competitive harm to MCC Telephony.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use MCC Telephony's proprietary commercial and operational information to
MCC Telephony's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning MCC
Telephony's commercial agreements, as well as information as to how MCC Telephony provides
its services. The prices and terms for the provision of such services are a substantial
differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure of the Carrier Agreement
would result in significant competitive harm to MCC Telephony's carrier partner. This
information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
MCC Telephony has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; MCC Telephony is
prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement, except as expressly
authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
MCC Telephony does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or that the
Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non
disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITIING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
MCC Telephony requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. MCC
Telephony and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in effect
indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance would
cause competitive harm to MCC Telephony's carrier partner regarding of the timing of the
disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT MCC TELEPHONY BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns MCC Telephony's proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, MCC Telephony respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3004 or
via email to nfernandez@inteserra.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Sincerely,
