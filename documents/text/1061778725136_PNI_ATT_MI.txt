AT&T-22STATE shall continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement until a successor agreement becomes effective between the Parties. AT&T-
22STATE’s obligation to provide services under this Agreement beyond the expiration date conditions upon
the Parties adherence to the timeframes established within Section 252(b) of the Act. If CLEC does not
adhere to said timeframes or CLEC withdraws its arbitration or seeks an extension of time or continuance of
such arbitration without AT&T-22STATE’s consent, AT&T-22STATE may provide Notice to CLEC that all
services provided thereafter shall be pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-
22STATE’s then current standard interconnection agreement (“Generic”) as found on AT&T’s CLEC Online

9.1 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC for any fraud associated with CLEC’s End User account, including 1+
IntraLATA toll, ported numbers, and ABT.
9.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in cases of fraud
involving 1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties’ fraud minimization procedures are to be
cost-effective and implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm one Party as compared to the other.
9.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in Section 9.1
above will include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning End Users who terminate
services to that Party without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such information is responsible for
securing the End User’s permission to obtain such information.
9.4 AT&T-22STATE will use a Fraud Monitoring System to determine suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud and
will provide notification messages to CLEC on suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud on CLEC accounts stored
in the applicable LIDB.
9.5 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of fraud. CLEC
understands and agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to determine whether a fraud situation
actually exists. CLEC understands and agrees that it will also need to determine what, if any, action CLEC should
take as a result of a Fraud Monitoring System alert.
9.6 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud Monitoring System alert
notification.
