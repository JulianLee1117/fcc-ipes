RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Ton80 Communications, LLC; Application of
TonBO Communications, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to
Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 19-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, Ton80 Communications, LLC ("Ton80
Communications") hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering
resources.
Ton80 Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and
accord confidential treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive
trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information
Act ("FOIA").1 Ton80 Communications is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not
customarily be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 •
Moreover, Ton80 Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."

Communications hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.5
Ton80 Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
Ton80 Communications is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier
partner, as proof of Ton80 Communications' facilities readiness as required by Section 52.
15{g){3)(i)(D) of the Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED/
The information for which Ton80 Communications seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors"8 .
Exhibit A describes the agreement between Ton80 Communications and its carrier partner and
contains proprietary commercial information concerning Ton80 Communications' network,
customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION. 9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Ton80 Communications' disadvantage. Ton80 Communications has numerous competitors in
the Voice over Internet Protocol {"VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed
operations and commercial information of the type provided by Ton80 Communications could
compromise Ton80 Communications' position in this highly competitive industry. Release would
therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Ton80 Communications.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM10
Competitors could use Ton80 Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to Ton80 Communications' detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information about how Ton80 Communications provides services as well as about Ton80
Communications' commercial agreements with others in the market that are not normally
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Ton80 Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.'Z
Ton80 Communications has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.13
Ton80 Communications requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten
years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
