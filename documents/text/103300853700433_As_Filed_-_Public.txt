REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INPSCTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of TeiNet Worldwide, Inc. Corporation;
Application of Te/Net Worldwide, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
Pursuant to Section 52.15{g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 20-
Dear Secretary:
Pursuant to Section §52.1S(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 Tel Net Worldwide, Inc. ("TeiNet") hereby
submits its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources.
TeiNet respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the Commission's Rules,2
the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to Exhibit A to the
application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that
falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3 Moreover, TeiNet would suffer
substantial competitive harm if this information were disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
-NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, Tel Net hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAl TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
TeiNet seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
Tel Net is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as proof of Tel Net's
facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 1S(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's Rules.
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for "trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."

March 30, 2021
Page 2 of 3
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which TeiNet seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A describes the
agreement between TeiNet and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning TeiNet's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoiP providers to compromise TeiNet's position in the highly competitive
interconnected VoiP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial information of the
type provided by TeiNet could compromise TeiNet's position in this highly competitive industry.
Accordingly, release of this information would result in substantial competitive harm to Tel Net.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use TeiNet's proprietary commercial and operational information to TeiNet's
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning TeiNet's commercial
agreements, as well as information as to how TeiNet provides its services. The prices and terms
for the provision of such services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers.
Therefore, disclosure of the Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to
TeiNet's carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
TeiNet has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; TeiNet is prohibited by
contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement, except as expressly authorized by the
carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
TeiNet does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or that the Carrier
Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non-disclosure
agreement regarding their contents.

March 30, 2021
Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
TeiNet requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. TeiNet and its
carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in effect indefinitely and therefore
any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance would cause competitive harm to
Tel Net's carrier partner regarding of the timing of the disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT TELNET BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER ITS
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns TeiNet's proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, TeiNet respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be granted confidential
status and withheld from public inspection.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3002 or
via email to cwightman@inteserra.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
