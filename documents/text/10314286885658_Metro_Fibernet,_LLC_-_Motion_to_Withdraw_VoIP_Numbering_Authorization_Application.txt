The Commission’s Rules )
MOTION OF METRO FIBERNET, LLC TO WITHDRAW
Metro Fibernet, LLC (“MFN”) previously filed an application with the Federal
Communications Commission (the “Commission”) for authorization to acquire telephone numbers
directly from the North American Numbering Plan Administrator and the Pooling Administrator
(the “Numbering Administrators”) pursuant to Commission rule section 52.15(g)(3).1 Since the
time of filing, MFN’s management has decided to acquire this capability through a third party.
Because MFN no longer needs to acquire telephone numbers from the Numbering
Administrator, the Application is now moot. MFN requests to withdraw its Application without
prejudice. MFN may need this authority at some point in the future as customer volume increase.
As such, MFN seeks the ability to refile an Application at an appropriate future date.
Please close the Docket at this time. To the extent MFN needs to acquire telephone
numbers directly in the future, it will open a new docket.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3).

WHEREAS MFN no longer needs to access telephone numbers directly, WC Docket No.
19-100 should be CLOSED.
