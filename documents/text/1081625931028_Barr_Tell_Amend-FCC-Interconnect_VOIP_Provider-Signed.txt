Re: Docket # WC 16-252
Numbering Authorization Amendment
Dear Madam/Sirs:
Please allow this letter to serve as an Amendment to our initial Numbering Authorization
Application pursuant to 47 CFR part 54 as an interconnected VOIP Provider filing for
authorization to obtain telephone numbers
In one of the first paragraphs on page 1 of our application it stated:
“Our company, Barr Tell USA. Inc. has been a CLEC that has been providing
telecommunication service(s) for the past 6 years directly to consumers, etc.”
This paragraph is hereby amended to:
Our company, Barr Tell USA. Inc., through its retail division of the company (under the
same name) has been a VOIP provider of telecommunication service(s), marketing
VOIP telecom services directly to consumers. The wholesale division of Barr Tell works
in partnership with the retail division as its Carrier partner and shares the use of an
assortment of telephone numbers for the purpose of allotting these to retail consumers.
Therefore, since it already provides interconnected VOIP services to retail businesses it
will easily be able to comply within the sixty (60) days of any new numbering resource
activation dates (in accordance with 47 CFR § 52.15(g)(2))
Additionally, pursuant to Federal Communications Commission #15-70 paragraph 37
stating:
" Therefore, we permit an interconnected VoIP provider that has obtained Commission
authorization to request numbers directly to demonstrate proof of facilities readiness by

(1) providing a combination of an agreement between the interconnected VoIP provider
and its carrier partner and an interconnection agreement between that carrier and the
relevant local exchange carrier (LEC), or
(2) proof that the interconnected VoIP provider obtains interconnection with the PSTN
pursuant to a tariffed offering or a commercial arrangement (such as a TDM-to-IP or a
VoIP interconnection agreement) that provides access to the PSTN. The
interconnected VoIP provider need not demonstrate that the point where it delivers
traffic to or accepts traffic from the PSTN is in any particular geographic location so long
as it demonstrates that it is ready to provide interconnected VoIP service, which is by
definition service that “[p]ermits users generally to receive calls that originate on the
public switched telephone network and to terminate calls to the public switched
telephone network.”
Please see our website, where Barr Tell already provides evidence of its Carrier
Partner(s) and/or Interconnection Agrements:

Agreements. If you click on these you can see the Interconnection Agreements listed.
Also, please note that using our June 30th, 2016 data we have submitted our 477
Report.
In addition, pursuant to this Application, Barr Tell USA has no owner or partners that are
foreigners. Everyone within Barr Tell is a 100% American citizen.
Hopefully, this addresses any errors made in our first application? If not please don't
hesitate to contact me where any additional amendments may be necessary.
