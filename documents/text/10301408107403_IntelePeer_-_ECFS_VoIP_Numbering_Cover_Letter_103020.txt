Re: Application of IntelePeer Networks LLC, For Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources, Pursuant to Section 52.15(g), Docket No. 20-____
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to §52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules,1 IntelePeer Networks LLC
(“IntelePeer”) files its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources. Please
note, this Application contains confidential material, the disclosure of which would
competitively harm the Company. Accordingly, IntelePeer requests this material be filed under
seal, pursuant to §0.459 of the Commission’s Rules.2 In support of this request, IntelePeer
submits the following:
1. Identification of the information for which confidential treatment is sought.
IntelePeer seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits A and B to its Application, and
specific references to these exhibits found in the body of its Application.
2. Description of the circumstances giving rise to the submission.
1 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
2 47 C.F.R. § 0.459.

As part of its Application, IntelePeer is including the agreement between its carrier
partner as proof of its facilities readiness as required by §52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s Rules, and copies of a number of the carrier’s interconnection agreements
with incumbent carriers.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
The information for which IntelePeer seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.” The
Exhibits to this Application describes the agreement between IntelePeer and its carrier
partner and contains proprietary commercial information concerning IntelePeer’s
network, customers, financing, and services.
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial or
contains a trade secret or is privileged.
The Exhibits contain information relating to commercial matters which can be used by
other interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) providers to compromise
IntelePeer’s position in the highly competitive interconnected VoIP sector. Accordingly,
release of this information would result in substantial competitive harm to IntelePeer.
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial competitive
harm.
Competitors could use IntelePeer’s proprietary commercial and operational information
to IntelePeer’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning
IntelePeer’s commercial agreements, as well as information as to how IntelePeer provides
its services. This information is not typically disclosed publicly.
6. Identification of any measures taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure, or if the
information has been disclosed previously.
Neither IntelePeer nor its carrier-partner have distributed the information to the public or
to any third party.
7. Justification of the period during which IntelePeer asserts that material should not be
available for public disclosure.
IntelePeer requests that the Exhibits be treated as confidential for a minimum period of
ten years. This period is necessary due to the nature of the proprietary information in the
Exhibits of the Application.
