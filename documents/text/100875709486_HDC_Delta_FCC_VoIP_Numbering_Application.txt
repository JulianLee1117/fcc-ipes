DearSecretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, HDC Delta, LLC ("HDC Delta") hereby
submits its application requesting authorizationto obtain numberingresources.

C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom ofInformation Act ("FOIA").l HDC
Delta is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, HDC Delta would suffer
substantial competitive harm ifthis informationwere disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLICINSPECTION."
