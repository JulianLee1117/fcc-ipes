REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Clear Rate Communications LLC; Application of
Clear Rate Communications LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to
Section 52.lS(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 25-
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.I5(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 Clear Rate Communications LLC ("Clear
Rate Communications") hereby submits its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources.
Clear Rate Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules,2 the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibits A and C to the application because the documents contain sensitive trade secrets
and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, Clear Rate Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information
were disclosed.
Exhibits A and C are accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT -NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, Clear Rate Communications hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
Clear Rate Communications seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits A and C to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
Clear Rate Communications is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner
as proof of Clear Rate Communications' facilities readiness as required by Section 52.
15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's Rules. Clear Rate Communications is submitting as Exhibit C
its 911 Trunking Order as proof that it complies with the 911 and 988 obligations under part 9 of
the relevant chapter.
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for "trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."

Page 2 of 3
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which Clear Rate Communications seeks confidential treatment contains
sensitive commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors".
Exhibit A describes the agreement between Clear Rate Communications and its carrier partner
and contains proprietary commercial information concerning Clear Rate Communications'
network, customers, and services. Exhibit C outlines Clear Rate Communications' compliance
with its 911 and 988 obligations, which contain proprietary information concerning Clear Rate
Communications' network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoIP providers to compromise Clear Rate Communications' position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoIP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by Clear Rate Communications could compromise Clear Rate
Communications' position in this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this
information would result in substantial competitive harm to Clear Rate Communications.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use Clear Rate Communications' proprietary commercial and operational
information to Clear Rate Communications' detriment as they would gain access to sensitive
information concerning Clear Rate Communications' commercial agreements, as well as
information as to how Clear Rate Communications provides its services. The prices and terms for
the provision of such services are a substantial differentiator between competing carriers.
Therefore, disclosure of the Carrier Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to
Clear Rate Communications' carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to the
public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
Clear Rate Communications has not distributed the information in Exhibits A and C to the public;
Clear Rate Communications is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier
Agreement, except as expressly authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
Clear Rate Communications does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the
public or that the Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the
protection of a non-disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
Clear Rate Communications requests that Exhibits A and C be withheld from public disclosure
indefinitely. Clear Rate Communications and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement
to remain in effect indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their
substance would cause competitive harm to Clear Rate Communications' carrier partner
regarding of the timing of the disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CLEAR RATE COMMUNICATIONS BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns Clear Rate Communications' proprietary network information, related
to current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially
sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, Clear Rate Communications respectfully requests that Exhibits A and C be
granted confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
The $1485 filing fee has been remitted using the CORES fee payment system.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 470-672-3933 or
via email to nelson.fernandez@jsitel.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

3.0 Interpretation, Construction and Severability
3.1 Definitions:
3.1.1 For purposes of this Agreement, certain terms have been defined in this Agreement to encompass
meanings that may differ from, or be in addition to, the normal connotation of the defined word. Unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise, any term defined or used in the singular will include the plural.
Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 14 of 56

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
neuter forms. The words “include”, “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
“without limitation” and/or “but not limited to”. The words “will” and “shall” are used interchangeably
throughout this Agreement and the use of either connotes a mandatory requirement. The use of one or the
other will not mean a different degree of right or obligation for either Party. A defined word intended to
convey its special meaning is capitalized when used. Other terms that are capitalized and not defined in
this Agreement will have the meaning in the Act, or in the absence of their inclusion in the Act, their
customary usage in the Telecommunications industry as of the Effective Date.
3.2 Headings Not Controlling:
3.2.1 The headings and numbering of Sections, Parts, Attachments, Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms herein or affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
3.2.2 This Agreement incorporates a number of Attachments which, together with their associated Exhibits,
Schedules and Addenda, constitute the entire Agreement between the Parties. In order to facilitate use and
comprehension of the Agreement, the Attachments have been grouped under broad headings. It is
understood that these groupings are for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to limit the
applicability that any particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda may otherwise have.
3.3 Referenced Documents:
3.3.1 Any reference throughout this Agreement to an industry guideline, AT&T-22STATE’s technical guideline or
referenced AT&T-22STATE business rule, guide or other such document containing processes or
specifications applicable to the services provided pursuant to this Agreement, shall be construed to refer to
only those provisions thereof that are applicable to these services, and shall include any successor or
replacement versions thereof, all as they are amended from time to time and all of which are incorporated
herein by reference, and may be found at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.4 References:
3.4.1 References herein to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments, Exhibits, Parts and Schedules shall be deemed to
be references to Sections, Paragraphs, Attachments and Parts of, and Exhibits, Schedules to this
Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require.
3.5 Tariff References:
3.5.1 References to state tariffs throughout this Agreement shall be to the currently effective tariff for the state or
jurisdiction in which the services were provisioned; provided however, where certain AT&T-22STATE
services or tariff provisions have been or become deregulated or detariffed, any reference in this Agreement
to a detariffed or deregulated service or provision of such tariff shall be deemed to refer to the service
description, price list or other agreement pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE provides such services as a
result of detariffing or deregulation.
3.5.2 Wherever the term “customer” is used in connection with AT&T-22STATE’s retail tariffs, the term “customer”
means the ultimate consumer or the End User of any tariffed service.
3.5.3 AT&T-21STATE only:
3.5.3.1 No reference to tariffs in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed as permitting CLEC to
purchase Interconnection Services, under such tariff. Except where expressly permitted
elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the availability of Interconnection Services under
tariffs in some AT&T-21STATE incumbent ILEC states, CLEC agrees that any purchase of
Interconnection Services addressed by this Agreement or required to be offered by AT&T-
21STATE under Section 251 of the Act, shall be purchased solely pursuant to the terms,
condition and rates set forth in this Agreement. To the extent that complete terms, conditions
and/or rates for any Interconnection Service are not contained in this Agreement at the time
CLEC seeks to order such services, the Parties shall amend this Agreement to include such
terms, conditions and rates prior to CLEC submitting such order. The rates for Interconnection

Services inadvertently or improperly ordered prior to an agreement of the Parties on terms,
conditions and/or rates is addressed in the Pricing Schedule.
3.5.4 AT&T CONNECTICUT only:
3.5.4.1 Whenever provisions of this Agreement could be interpreted to conflict with provisions of the
Connecticut Access Service Tariff, the Tariff shall apply.
3.6 Conflict in Provisions:
3.6.1 If any definitions, terms or conditions in any given Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda differ from
those contained in the main body of this Agreement, those definitions, terms or conditions will supersede
those contained in the main body of this Agreement, but only in regard to the services or activities listed in
that particular Attachment, Exhibit, Schedule or Addenda. In particular, if an Attachment contains a Term
length that differs from the Term length in the main body of this Agreement, the Term length of that
Attachment will control the length of time that services or activities are to occur under that Attachment, but
will not affect the Term length of the remainder of this Agreement.
3.6.2 In AT&T CONNECTICUT only, in the event of a conflict between any provision in this Agreement and any
provision in the PURA-ordered tariffs covering the services that are the subject of this Agreement with AT&T
CONNECTICUT, such PURA-ordered tariffs will prevail.
3.7 Joint Work Product:
3.7.1 This Agreement is the joint work product of the Parties and has been negotiated by the Parties and their
respective counsel and shall be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms and, in the event of any
ambiguities, no inferences shall be drawn against either Party.
3.7.2 If any provision of this Agreement is rejected or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, each Party
agrees that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of
the Parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to affect the intent of the Parties, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with
enforceable language that reflects such intent as closely as possible. The Parties negotiated the terms and
conditions of this Agreement for Interconnection Services as a total arrangement and it is intended to be
non-severable.
3.8 Incorporation by Reference:
3.8.1 All of the rates, terms and conditions (“Provisions”) set forth in this Agreement (including any and all
Attachments, and/or Schedules hereto) and every Interconnection Service provided hereunder, are subject
to all other Provisions contained in this Agreement and all such Provisions are integrally related.
3.9 Non-Voluntary Provisions:
3.9.1 This Agreement incorporates certain rates, terms and conditions that were not voluntarily negotiated and/or
agreed to by AT&T-22STATE, but instead resulted from determinations made in arbitrations under Section
252 of the Act or from other requirements of regulatory agencies or state law (individually and collectively
“Non-Voluntary Arrangement(s)”). If any Non-Voluntary Arrangement is modified as a result of any order or
finding by the FCC, the appropriate Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree to
follow the Intervening Law process outlined in Section 23.0 below.
3.9.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Non-Voluntary Arrangements contained in this Agreement shall not be
available in any state other than the state that originally imposed/required such Non-Voluntary Arrangement.
By way of example only, the Parties acknowledge that the PUC-OH’s imposition in Ohio of the Minimum
Telephone Service Standards (and all terms and conditions relating thereto) shall not apply in or be
“portable to” any State other than Ohio.
3.10 State-Specific Rates, Terms and Conditions:

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 16 of 56
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
3.10.1 For ease of administration, this multi-state Agreement contains certain specified rates, terms and conditions
which apply only in a designated state (“state-specific terms”).
3.10.2 State-specific terms, as the phrase is described in Section 3.10.1 above, have been negotiated (or in the
case of Section 3.9.2 above, included in the agreement per state requirement) by the Parties only as to the
states where this Agreement has been executed, filed and approved. When the Parties negotiate an
agreement for an additional state, neither Party shall be precluded by any language in this Agreement from
negotiating state-specific terms for the state in which they are to apply.
3.11 Scope of Obligations:
3.11.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, AT&T-22STATE’s obligations under this
Agreement shall apply only to:
3.11.1.1 the specific operating area(s) or portion thereof in which AT&T-22STATE is then deemed to be
the ILEC under the Act (the “ILEC Territory”), and only to the extent that the CLEC is operating
and offering service to End Users identified to be residing in such ILEC Territory; and
3.11.1.2 assets that AT&T-22STATE owns or leases and which are used in connection with AT&T-
22STATE’s provision to CLEC of any Interconnection Services provided or contemplated under
this Agreement, the Act or any tariff or ancillary agreement referenced herein (individually and
collectively, the “ILEC Assets”).
3.11.2 This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE agrees to provide
CLEC with access to 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6), Interconnection under Section
251(c)(2) and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) in AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange Areas for
the provision of CLEC’s Telecommunications Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-
22STATE is only obligated to make available 251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation under Section 251(c)(6),
Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) to CLEC in AT&T-
22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange Areas. AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to provide such 251(c)(3)
UNEs, Collocation, Interconnection and/or Resale, to CLEC for the purposes of CLEC providing and/or
extending service outside of AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange Areas. In addition, AT&T-
22STATE is not obligated to provision 251(c)(3) UNEs or to provide access to (251(c)(3) UNEs, Collocation
under Section 251(c)(6), Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4)
and is not otherwise bound by any 251(c) obligations in geographic areas other than AT&T-22STATE’s
incumbent local Exchange Areas. Therefore, the Parties understand and agree that the rates, terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement shall only apply to the Parties and be available to CLEC for
provisioning Telecommunication Services within an AT&T-22STATE incumbent local Exchange Area(s) in
the State in which this Agreement has been approved by the relevant state Commission and is in effect.
3.11.3 Throughout this Agreement, wherever there are references to Unbundled Network Elements that are to be
provided by AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement, the Parties agree and acknowledge that their intent is
for the Agreement to comply with Section 3.11.2 above, and require only the provision of Section 251(c)(3)
UNEs.
3.12 Affiliates:
3.12.1 This Agreement, including subsequent amendments, if any, shall bind AT&T-22STATE, CLEC and any
entity that currently or subsequently is owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with
CLEC. CLEC further agrees that the same or substantially the same terms and conditions shall be
incorporated into any separate agreement between AT&T-22STATE and any such CLEC Affiliate that
continues to operate as a separate entity. This Agreement shall remain effective as to CLEC and any such
CLEC Affiliate for the term of this Agreement as stated herein, (subject to any early termination due to
default), until either AT&T-22STATE or CLEC or any such CLEC Affiliate institutes renegotiation consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement for renewal and term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement
will not supersede a currently effective interconnection agreement between any such CLEC Affiliate and
AT&T-22STATE until the expiration of such other agreement.

Agreement, whichever is later.
6.1.2 The Parties agree:
6.1.2.1 the failure of AT&T-22STATE to demand such certificate of insurance or failure of AT&T-
22STATE to identify a deficiency will not be construed as a waiver of CLEC’s obligation to
maintain the insurance required under this Agreement;
6.1.2.2 that the insurance required under this Agreement does not represent that coverage and limits will
necessarily be adequate to protect CLEC, nor be deemed as a limitation on CLEC’s liability to
AT&T-22STATE in this Agreement;

and Umbrella/Excess liability insurance; and

7.1 Assignment or Transfer of Agreement:
7.1.1 CLEC may not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, whether by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of

assignment or transfer CLEC shall provide AT&T-22STATE with a minimum of one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days advance written Notice of any assignment associated with a CLEC Company Code
(ACNA/CIC/OCN) change or transfer of ownership of assets and request AT&T-22STATE’s written consent.
CLEC’s written Notice shall include the anticipated effective date of the assignment or transfer. Any
attempted assignment or transfer that is not permitted is void as to AT&T-22STATE and need not be
recognized by AT&T-22STATE unless it consents or otherwise chooses to do so for a more limited purpose.
CLEC may assign or transfer this Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, to an Affiliate by providing sixty (60) calendar days advance written Notice of such
assignment to AT&T-22STATE; provided that such assignment or transfer is not inconsistent with
Applicable Law (including the Affiliate’s obligation to obtain and maintain proper Commission certification
and approvals) or the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CLEC may
not assign or transfer this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, to an Affiliate if that Affiliate is

7.3.3 For any CLEC Company Code Change, CLEC must negotiate a separate transfer or assignment
agreement.

outstanding charges associated with any transferred or acquired assets.

8.4.4 If the Parties are in “Active Negotiations” (negotiations within the statutory clock established in the Act under
Section 252(b)) or have filed for arbitration with the Commission upon expiration date of the Agreement
AT&T-22STATE shall continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement until a successor agreement becomes effective between the Parties. AT&T-
22STATE’s obligation to provide services under this Agreement beyond the expiration date conditions upon
the Parties adherence to the timeframes established within Section 252(b) of the Act. If CLEC does not
adhere to said timeframes or CLEC withdraws its arbitration or seeks an extension of time or continuance of
such arbitration without AT&T-22STATE’s consent, AT&T-22STATE may provide Notice to CLEC that all
services provided thereafter shall be pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-
22STATE’s then current standard interconnection agreement (“Generic”) as found on AT&T’s CLEC Online
website.
8.4.5 Either on or following the expiration date of this Agreement, if the Parties have not entered into a new
agreement or are not in Active Negotiations as described in Section 8.4.4 above, then upon written Notice to
CLEC by AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE may continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s then current Generic found at the AT&T CLEC Online

IntraLATA toll, ported numbers, and ABT.
9.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in cases of fraud
involving 1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties’ fraud minimization procedures are to be
cost-effective and implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm one Party as compared to the other.
9.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in Section 9.1
above will include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning End Users who terminate
services to that Party without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such information is responsible for
securing the End User’s permission to obtain such information.
9.4 AT&T-22STATE will use a Fraud Monitoring System to determine suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud and
will provide notification messages to CLEC on suspected occurrences of ABT-related fraud on CLEC accounts stored
in the applicable LIDB.
9.5 CLEC understands that Fraud Monitoring System alerts only identify potential occurrences of fraud. CLEC
understands and agrees that it will need to perform its own investigations to determine whether a fraud situation
actually exists. CLEC understands and agrees that it will also need to determine what, if any, action CLEC should
take as a result of a Fraud Monitoring System alert.
9.6 The Parties will provide contact names and numbers to each other for the exchange of Fraud Monitoring System alert
notification.
10.0 Assurance of Payment

10.2.1 If based on AT&T-22STATE’s analysis of the AT&T-22STATE Credit Profile and other relevant information

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
credit worthiness of CLEC. Such impairment will be determined from information available from Third Party
financial sources; or
10.2.2 CLEC fails to timely pay a bill rendered to CLEC by AT&T-22STATE (except such portion of a bill that is
subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth
in Section 12.4 below); and/or
10.2.3 CLEC’s gross monthly billing has increased, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to request additional
security (or to require a security deposit if none was previously requested) and/or file a Uniform Commercial
Code (UCC-1) security interest in CLEC’s “accounts receivables and proceeds”; or
10.2.4 When CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary
case (or has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other
law relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has
made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding.
10.3 If AT&T-22STATE requires CLEC to provide a security deposit, CLEC shall provide such security deposit prior to the
inauguration of service or within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-22STATE’s request, as applicable. Deposit
request notices will be sent to CLEC via certified mail or overnight delivery. Such notice period will start the day after
the deposit request notice is rendered by certified mail or overnight delivery. Interest on a cash security deposit shall
accrue and be applied or refunded in accordance with the terms in AT&T-22STATE’s applicable Tariff.
10.4 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the assurance of payment will consist of:
10.4.1 a Cash Deposit; or
10.4.2 a Letter of Credit; or
10.4.3 a Surety Bond.
10.5 The Cash Deposit, Letter of Credit or Surety Bond must be in an amount up to three (3) months anticipated charges
(including, but not limited to, recurring, non-recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination charges and advance
payments), as reasonably determined by AT&T-22STATE, for the Interconnection Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs,
Collocation or any other functions, facilities, products or services to be furnished by AT&T-22STATE under this
Agreement. Estimated billings are calculated based upon the monthly average of the previous six (6) months current
billings, if CLEC has received service from AT&T-22STATE during such period at a level comparable to that
anticipated to occur over the next six (6) months. If either CLEC or AT&T-22STATE has reason to believe that the
level of service to be received during the next six (6) months will be materially higher or lower than received in the
previous six (6) months, CLEC and AT&T-22STATE shall agree on a level of estimated billings based on all relevant
information.
10.6 To the extent that AT&T-22STATE elects to require a Cash Deposit, the Parties intend that the provision of such
Cash Deposit shall constitute the grant of a security interest in the Cash Deposit pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code in effect in any relevant jurisdiction.
10.7 Interest on a Cash Deposit shall accrue and be applied or refunded in accordance with the terms in the appropriate
AT&T-22STATE Tariff. AT&T-22STATE will not pay interest on a Letter of Credit or a Surety Bond.
10.8 AT&T-22STATE may, but is not obligated to, draw on the Letter of Credit or the Cash Deposit, as applicable, upon
the occurrence of any one of the following events:
10.8.1 CLEC owes AT&T-22STATE undisputed charges under this Agreement that are more than thirty (30)
calendar days past due; or
10.8.2 CLEC admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due, has commenced a voluntary case (or
has had an involuntary case commenced against it) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other law
relating to insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the like, has made
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a receivership or similar proceeding; or
10.8.3 The expiration or termination of this Agreement.

provide a replacement or supplemental Letter of Credit, Surety Bond or Cash Deposit conforming to the requirements
of Section 10.4 above.
10.10 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if AT&T-22STATE makes a request for assurance of
payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.10 then AT&T-22STATE shall have no obligation thereafter
to perform under this Agreement until such time as CLEC has furnished AT&T-22STATE with the assurance of
payment requested; provided, however, that AT&T-22STATE will permit CLEC a minimum of fifteen (15) calendar
days to respond to a request for assurance of payment before invoking this Section 10.10.
10.11 In the event CLEC fails to provide AT&T-22STATE with a suitable form of security deposit or additional security
deposit as required herein, defaults on its account(s), or otherwise fails to make any payment or payments required
under this Agreement in the manner and within the time required, service to CLEC may be suspended, discontinued
or terminated in accordance with the terms of Section 10.0 above. Upon termination of services, AT&T-22STATE
shall apply any security deposit to CLEC’s final bill for its account(s). If CLEC fails to furnish the requested adequate
assurance of payment on or before the date set forth in the request, AT&T-22STATE may also invoke the provisions
set forth in Section 12.0 below.
10.12 A Cash Deposit held by AT&T-22STATE shall be returned to CLEC if the following conditions have been met:
10.12.1 Payment was made on bills rendered to CLEC by AT&T-22STATE (except such portion of a bill that is
subject to a good faith, bona fide dispute and as to which CLEC has complied with all requirements set forth
in Section 12.4 below) as of the Bill Due Date for all but one time during the prior twelve (12) month period
and all payments were made with checks that were honored; and
10.12.2 There has been no impairment of the established credit and/or financial health from information available
from financial sources, including but not limited to Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and the Wall Street
Journal. Financial information about CLEC that may be considered includes, but is not limited to, investor
warning briefs, rating downgrades, and articles discussing pending credit problems.
10.13 The fact that a Cash Deposit or Letter of Credit is requested by AT&T-22STATE shall in no way relieve CLEC from
timely compliance with all payment obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, recurring, non-
recurring and usage sensitive charges, termination charges and advance payments), nor does it constitute a waiver
or modification of the terms of this Agreement pertaining to disconnection or re-entry for non-payment of any
amounts required to be paid hereunder.
10.14 At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit provided by CLEC as security under
this Agreement, CLEC shall renew such Letter of Credit or provide AT&T-22STATE with evidence that CLEC has
obtained a suitable replacement for the Letter of Credit. If CLEC fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE
shall thereafter be authorized to draw down the full amount of such Letter of Credit and utilize the cash proceeds as
security for CLEC accounts(s). If CLEC provides a security deposit or additional security deposit in the form of a
Surety Bond as required herein, CLEC shall renew the Surety Bond or provide AT&T-22STATE with evidence that
CLEC has obtained a suitable replacement for the Surety Bond at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the
cancellation date of the Surety Bond. If CLEC fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE shall thereafter be
authorized to take action on the Surety Bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for CLEC’s account(s). If the
credit rating of any bonding company that has provided CLEC with a Surety Bond provided as security hereunder has
fallen below “B”, AT&T-22STATE will provide written Notice to CLEC that CLEC must provide a replacement bond or
other suitable security within fifteen (15) calendar days of AT&T-22STATE’s written Notice. If CLEC fails to comply
with the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE shall thereafter be authorized to take action on the Surety Bond and utilize the
cash proceeds as security for CLEC’s account(s). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, AT&T-22STATE shall be authorized to draw down the full amount of any Letter of Credit or take action on
any Surety Bond provided by CLEC as security hereunder if CLEC defaults on its account(s) or otherwise fails to
make any payment or payments required under this Agreement in the manner and within the time, as required
herein.

11.5 The Remittance Information to apply payments must accompany the payment. Payment is considered to have been
made when the payment and Remittance Information are received by AT&T-22STATE. If the Remittance

House Association (NACHA) Rules and Regulations. Each ACH payment must be received by AT&T-22STATE no
later than the Bill Due Date of each bill or Late Payment Charges will apply. AT&T-22STATE is not liable for any
delays in receipt of funds or errors in entries caused by CLEC or Third Parties, including CLEC’s financial institution.
CLEC is responsible for its own banking fees.
11.7 Prior to establishing EFT, CLEC will complete a Customer Information Form for Electronic Payments (ECF11 Form)

information for electronic payments. AT&T-22STATE banking information will be provided by AT&T-22STATE
Treasury & Remittance Operations on AT&T-22STATE approved forms after the CLEC’s completed ECF11 form is
received, testing has completed and certification confirmed.
11.8 Processing of payments not made via electronic funds credit transfers through the ACH network may be delayed.
CLEC is responsible for any Late Payment Charges resulting from CLEC’s failure to use electronic funds credit
transfers through the ACH network.

11.15 Failure by the Non-Paying Party to pay any charges determined to be owed to the Billing Party within the time

Agreement.
11.16 CLEC will notify AT&T-22STATE at least ninety (90) calendar days or three (3) monthly billing cycles prior to any
billing changes. At that time a sample of the new invoice will be provided so that AT&T-22STATE has time to
program for any changes that may impact validation and payment of the invoices. If notification is not received in the
specified time frame, then invoices will be held and not subject to any Late Payment Charges, until the appropriate
amount of time has passed to allow AT&T-22STATE the opportunity to test the new format and make changes
deemed necessary.
11.17 If either Party requests one (1) or more additional copies of a bill, the requesting Party will pay the Billing Party a
reasonable fee for each additional copy as specified in the Pricing Schedule, unless such copy was requested due to
failure in delivery of the original bill or correction(s) to the original bill.
12.0 Nonpayment and Procedures for Disconnection

12.2 below through Section 12.19 below, inclusive, shall be applied separately for each such state.

12.18 Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to obligate to AT&T-7STATE continue to provide local service to any

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its breach. No Party may pursue any claim unless such written

13.3.1.3 Formal Dispute Resolution, each of which is described below.

“dispute”. Failure to provide the information and evidence required by this Section 13.0 not later than
twenty-nine (29) calendar days following the Bill Due Date shall constitute CLEC’s irrevocable and full
waiver of its right to dispute the subject charges.
13.4.5 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on current billing statements thirty (30) to
sixty (60) calendar days from the Bill Due Date (provided the Disputing Party furnishes all requisite

dispute and the expected resolution date.
13.4.6 The Parties shall attempt to resolve Disputed Amounts appearing on statements prior to the current billing
statement within thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days, but resolution may take longer depending on the
complexity of the dispute. If not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days from the date Notice of the
Disputed Amounts was received (provided that CLEC furnishes all requisite information and evidence under
Section 13.4 above, upon request, the non-Disputing Party will notify the Disputing Party of the status of the
dispute and the expected resolution date.
13.4.7 If the Disputing Party is not satisfied by the resolution of the billing dispute under this Section 13.4 above,
the Disputing Party may notify the Billing Party in writing that it wishes to invoke the Informal Resolution of
Disputes afforded pursuant to Section 13.5 below of this Agreement.
13.5 Informal Dispute Resolution:
13.5.1 Upon receipt by one Party of Notice of a dispute by the other Party pursuant to Section 13.3 above or
Section 13.4.7 above, each Party will appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The location, form, frequency,
duration, and conclusion of these discussions will be left to the discretion of the representatives. Upon
agreement, the representatives may utilize other alternative Dispute Resolution procedures such as
mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and the correspondence among the representatives for
purposes of settlement are exempt from discovery and production and will not be admissible in the
arbitration described below or in any lawsuit without the concurrence of both Parties. Documents identified
in or provided with such communications that were not prepared for purposes of the negotiations are not so
exempted, and, if otherwise admissible, may be admitted in evidence in the arbitration or lawsuit.
13.6 Formal Dispute Resolution:
13.6.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the informal procedure described in Section 13.5
above, then either Party may invoke the formal Dispute Resolution procedures described in this Section

procedures as appropriate, may be invoked not earlier than sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the letter
initiating Dispute Resolution under Section 13.5 above.
13.6.2 Claims Subject to Elective Arbitration:
13.6.2.1 Claims will be subject to elective arbitration pursuant to Section 13.7 below, if, and only if, the
claim is not settled through informal Dispute Resolution and both Parties agree to arbitration. If
both Parties do not agree to arbitration, then either Party may proceed with any remedy available
to it pursuant to law, equity or agency mechanism.

13.6.3.1.2 All claims arising under federal or state statute(s), including antitrust claims.
13.7 Arbitration:
13.7.1 Disputes subject to elective arbitration under the provisions of this Agreement will be submitted to a single
arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or pursuant
to such other provider of arbitration services or rules as the Parties may agree. The arbitrator shall be
knowledgeable of telecommunications issues. Each arbitration will be held in Atlanta, Georgia for AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, Dallas, Texas for AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE); Chicago,
Illinois for AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, San Francisco, California for AT&T CALIFORNIA; Reno,
Nevada for AT&T NEVADA; or New Haven, Connecticut for AT&T CONNECTICUT, as appropriate, unless
the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitration hearing will be requested to commence within sixty (60)
calendar days of the demand for arbitration. The arbitrator will control the scheduling so as to process the
matter expeditiously. The Parties may submit written briefs upon a schedule determined by the arbitrator.
The Parties will request that the arbitrator rule on the dispute by issuing a written opinion within thirty (30)
calendar days after the close of hearings. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Secs. 1-16, not state law,
shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes. Notwithstanding any rule of the AAA Commercial Arbitration
Rules to the contrary, the Parties agree that the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive damages,
exemplary damages, Consequential Damages, multiple damages, or any other damages not measured by
the prevailing Party’s actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that
does not conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The times specified in this Section 13.0
may be extended or shortened upon mutual agreement of the Parties or by the arbitrator upon a showing of
good cause. Each Party will bear its own costs of these procedures, including attorneys’ fees. The Parties
will equally split the fees of the arbitration and the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and
binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
13.8 Compliance with Dispute Resolution Process
13.8.1 The Parties agree that any actions and/or claims seeking to compel compliance with the Dispute Resolution
process should be brought before the Commission in the state where the services in dispute are provided.
However, each Party reserves any rights it may have to seek review of any ruling made by the Commission
concerning this Agreement by a court of competent jurisdiction.
14.0 Audits

Agreement, the Auditing Party may audit the Audited Party’s books, records, data and other documents, as provided
herein, once annually, with the audit period commencing not earlier than the Service Start Date for the purpose of
evaluating (i) the accuracy of Audited Party’s billing and invoicing of the services provided hereunder and (ii)
verification of compliance with any provision of this Agreement that affects the accuracy of Auditing Party’s billing and
invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Auditing Party may
audit the Audited Party’s books, records and documents more than once annually if the previous audit found (i)
previously uncorrected net variances or errors in invoices in Audited Party’s favor with an aggregate value of at least
five percent (5%) of the amounts payable by Auditing Party for audited services provided during the period covered
by the audit or (ii) non-compliance by Audited Party with any provision of this Agreement affecting Auditing Party’s
billing and invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party with an aggregate value of at least five percent (5%) of
the amounts payable by Audited Party for audited services provided during the period covered by the audit.
14.2 The Parties also must mutually agree on a written scope of the audit and the billing and invoices to be audited prior to
the initiation of the audit.

covered by the audit which was last performed (or if no audit has been performed, the service start date and (ii) the
twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date the Audited Party received notice of such requested audit,

14.4 Such audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor acceptable to both Parties. Auditing Party shall insure that
the independent auditor executes a nondisclosure agreement in a form agreed upon by the Parties prior to engaging
in any audit work.
14.5 Each audit shall be conducted on the premises of the Audited Party during normal business hours. Audited Party
shall cooperate fully in any such audit and shall provide the auditor reasonable access to any and all appropriate
Audited Party employees and any books, records and other documents reasonably necessary to assess (i) the
accuracy of Audited Party’s bills and (ii) Audited Party’s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement that affect
the accuracy of Auditing Party’s billing and invoicing of the services provided to Audited Party hereunder. Except
where to do so would defeat the purpose of the audit, the Audited Party may redact from the books, records and
other documents provided to the auditor any Audited Party information that reveals the identity of End Users of
Audited Party.
14.6 Each Party shall maintain reports, records and data relevant to the billing of any services that are the subject matter
of this Agreement for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) months after creation thereof, unless a longer period

including making refund of any overpayment by Auditing Party in the form of a credit on the invoice for the first full
billing cycle after the Parties have agreed upon the accuracy of the audit results and (ii) for any undercharge caused
by the actions of the Audited Party, immediately compensate Auditing Party for such undercharge, and (iii) in each
case, calculate and pay interest as provided in Section 11.3.1 above (depending on the AT&T owned ILEC(s)
involved), for the number of calendar days from the date on which such undercharge or overcharge originated until
the date on which such credit is issued or payment is made and available.
14.8 Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, audits shall be performed at Auditing Party’s expense,
subject to reimbursement by Audited Party of one-quarter (1/4) of any independent auditor’s fees and expenses in
the event that an audit finds, and the Parties subsequently verify, a net adjustment in the charges paid or payable by
Auditing Party hereunder by an amount that is, on an annualized basis, greater than five percent (5%) of the
aggregate charges for the audited services during the period covered by the audit.
14.9 Any disputes concerning audit results shall be referred to the Parties’ respective personnel responsible for informal
resolution. If these individuals cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the referral, either Party
may request in writing that an additional audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor acceptable to both
Parties, subject to the requirements set out in Section 14.1 above. Any additional audit shall be at the requesting
Party’s expense.
15.0 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties
15.1 DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER PARTY CONCERNING THE
SPECIFIC QUALITY OF ANY SERVICES, OR FACILITIES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE
PARTIES DISCLAIM, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF
DEALING, OR FROM USAGES OF TRADE.
16.0 Limitation of Liability
16.1 Except for any indemnification obligations of the Parties hereunder, each Party’s liability to the other for any Loss
relating to or arising out of any cause whatsoever, including any negligent act or omission (whether willful or
inadvertent) whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, relating to the performance of this Agreement,
shall not exceed a credit for the actual cost of the facilities, products, services or functions not performed or provided
or improperly performed or provided.
16.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in specific Attachments, in the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a
Third Party to have arisen out of the negligence or willful misconduct of any Party, each Party shall bear, and its
obligation shall be limited to, that portion (as mutually agreed to by the Parties or as otherwise established) of the

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 35 of 56
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
resulting expense caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct or that of its agents, servants, contractors, or
others acting in aid or concert with it.
16.3 A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and contracts with its End Users or Third Parties that relate to
any Interconnection Services provided or contemplated under this Agreement that, to the maximum extent permitted
by Applicable Law, such Party shall not be liable to such End User or Third Party for (i) any Loss relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds the amount such Party would have
charged the End User or Third Party for the Interconnection Services that gave rise to such Loss and (ii) any
Consequential Damages. If a Party elects not to place in its tariffs or contracts such limitation(s) of liability, and the
other Party incurs a Loss as a result thereof, the first Party shall indemnify and reimburse the other Party for that
portion of the Loss that would have been limited had the first Party included in its tariffs and contracts the limitation(s)
of liability described in this Section 16.0.
16.4 Neither CLEC nor AT&T-22STATE shall be liable to the other Party for any Consequential Damages suffered by the
other Party, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty, strict liability, tort or otherwise, including
negligence of any kind, whether active or passive (and including alleged breaches of this Agreement and causes of
action alleged to arise from allegations that breach of this Agreement constitutes a violation of the Act or other
statute), and regardless of whether the Parties knew or had been advised of the possibility that such damages could
result in connection with or arising from anything said, omitted, or done hereunder or related hereto, including willful
acts or omissions; provided that the foregoing shall not limit a Party’s obligation under Section 16.0 to indemnify,
defend, and hold the other Party harmless against any amounts payable to a Third Party, including any Losses, and
Consequential Damages of such Third Party; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 16.4 shall impose
indemnity obligations on a Party for any Loss or Consequential Damages suffered by that Party’s End User in
connection with any affected Interconnection Services. Except as provided in the prior sentence, each Party
(“Indemnifying Party”) hereby releases and holds harmless the other Party (“Indemnitee”) (and Indemnitee’s
Affiliates, and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents) against any Loss or Claim made by the
Indemnifying Party’s End User.
16.5 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable for damages to an End User’s premises resulting from the furnishing of any
Interconnection Services, including, if applicable, the installation and removal of equipment and associated wiring,
and Collocation Equipment unless the damage is caused by AT&T-22STATE’s gross negligence or willful
misconduct. AT&T-22STATE does not guarantee or make any warranty with respect to Interconnection Services
when used in an explosive atmosphere.
16.6 CLEC hereby releases AT&T-22STATE from any and all liability for damages due to errors or omissions in CLEC’s
End User listing information as provided by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE under this Agreement, including any errors or
omissions occurring in the Directory Database or the White Pages directory, or any claims by reason of delay in
providing the Directory Assistance listing information, printing or provisioning of non-published numbers or the
printing or providing of CLEC End User information in the White Pages directory including, but not limited to, special,
indirect, Consequential, punitive or incidental damages.
16.7 AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC, its End User or any other Person for any Loss alleged to arise out of the
provision of access to 911 service or any errors, interruptions, defects, failures or malfunctions of 911 service.
16.8 This Section 16.0 is not intended to exempt any Party from all liability under this Agreement, but only to set forth the
scope of liability agreed to and the type of damages that are recoverable. Both Parties acknowledge that they
negotiated regarding alternate limitation of liability provisions but that such provisions would have altered the cost,
and thus the price, of providing the Interconnection, Resale Services, 251(c)(3) UNEs, functions, facilities, products
and services available hereunder, and no different pricing reflecting different costs and different limits of liability was
agreed to.
17.0 Indemnity
17.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in specific Attachments, each Party shall be responsible only for
the Interconnection Services which are provided by that Party, its authorized agents, subcontractors, or others
retained by such Parties, and neither Party shall bear any responsibility for the Interconnection Services, provided by
the other Party, its agents, subcontractors, or others retained by such Parties.

indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”) and hold such Indemnified Party harmless against any Loss to a
Third Party arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct (“Fault”) of such Indemnifying Party, its agents, its End
Users, contractors, or others retained by such Parties, in connection with the Indemnifying Party’s provision of
Interconnection Services under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) with respect to employees or agents of
the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while performing within the scope of their employment, (ii) with respect to
subcontractors of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing duties of the subcontractor
under its subcontract with the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) with respect to the Fault of employees or agents of such

respect to such duties of the subcontractor under the subcontract.
17.3 In the case of any Loss alleged or claimed by a End User of either Party, the Party whose End User alleged or
claimed such Loss (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend and indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”)
against any and all such Claims or Losses by its End User regardless of whether the underlying Interconnection
Service giving rise to such Claim or Loss was provided or provisioned by the Indemnified Party, unless the Claim or
Loss was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party.
17.4 A Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (“Indemnified Party”)
against any Claim or Loss arising from the Indemnifying Party’s use of Interconnection Services provided under this

Agreement, involving any Claim for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, or infringement of Intellectual Property
rights arising from the Indemnifying Party’s or its End User’s use.
17.4.1.1 The foregoing includes any Claims or Losses arising from disclosure of any End User-specific
information associated with either the originating or terminating numbers used to provision
Interconnection Services provided hereunder and all other Claims arising out of any act or
omission of the End User in the course of using any Interconnection Services provided pursuant
to this Agreement.
17.4.1.2 The foregoing includes any Losses arising from Claims for actual or alleged infringement of any
Intellectual Property right of a Third Party to the extent that such Loss arises from an
Indemnifying Party’s or an Indemnifying Party’s End User’s use of Interconnection Services,
provided under this Agreement; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party’s obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party shall not apply:
17.4.1.2.1 where an Indemnified Party or its End User modifies Interconnection Services,
provided under this Agreement; and
17.4.1.2.2 no infringement would have occurred without such modification.

Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA); provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall also, at its sole cost and expense, pay any amounts necessary to modify or replace any equipment,
facilities or services provided to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement to ensure that such equipment,
facilities and services fully comply with CALEA.
17.5 CLEC acknowledges that its right under this Agreement to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s network and to
unbundle and/or combine AT&T-22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements)
may be subject to or limited by Intellectual Property rights (including without limitation, patent, copyright, trade secret,
trade mark, service mark, trade name and trade dress rights) and contract rights of Third Parties.
17.6 AT&T-22STATE agrees to use its best efforts to obtain for CLEC, under commercially reasonable terms, Intellectual
Property rights to each 251(c)(3) UNE necessary for CLEC to use such 251(c)(3) UNE in the same manner as AT&T-
22STATE.

17.7 AT&T-22STATE shall have no obligation to attempt to obtain for CLEC any Intellectual Property right(s) that would
permit CLEC to use any 251(c)(3) UNE in a different manner than used by AT&T-22STATE.

Intellectual Property licenses, AT&T-22STATE shall reveal to CLEC the name of the vendor, the Intellectual Property
rights licensed to AT&T-22STATE under the vendor contract and the terms of the contract (excluding cost terms).
AT&T-22STATE shall, at CLEC’s request, contact the vendor to attempt to obtain permission to reveal additional
contract details to CLEC.
17.9 All costs associated with the extension of Intellectual Property rights to CLEC pursuant to Section 19.1 below,
including the cost of the license extension itself and the costs associated with the effort to obtain the license, shall be
a part of the cost of providing the 251(c)(3) UNE to which the Intellectual Property rights relate and apportioned to all
requesting carriers using that 251(c)(3) UNE including AT&T-22STATE.
17.10 AT&T-22STATE hereby conveys no licenses to use such Intellectual Property rights and makes no warranties,
express or implied, concerning CLEC’s (or any Third Parties’) rights with respect to such Intellectual Property rights
and contract rights, including whether such rights will be violated by such Interconnection or unbundling and/or
combining of 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) in AT&T-22STATE’s network or
CLEC’s use of other functions, facilities, products or services furnished under this Agreement. Any licenses or
warranties for Intellectual Property rights associated with 251(c)(3) UNEs subject to the ownership terms stated in
Section 19 of this Agreement.
17.11 AT&T-22STATE does not and shall not indemnify, defend or hold CLEC harmless, nor be responsible for
indemnifying or defending, or holding CLEC harmless, for any Claims or Losses for actual or alleged infringement of
any Intellectual Property right or interference with or violation of any contract right that arises out of, is caused by, or
relates to CLEC’s Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE’s network and unbundling and/or combining AT&T-
22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs (including combining with CLEC’s Network Elements) or CLEC’s use of other functions,
facilities, products or services furnished under this Agreement. Any indemnities for Intellectual Property rights
associated with 251(c)(3) UNEs shall be vendor’s indemnities and are subject to the ownership terms stated in
Section 19 of this Agreement.
17.12 CLEC shall reimburse AT&T-22STATE for damages to AT&T-22STATE’s facilities utilized to provide Interconnection
Services hereunder caused by the negligence or willful act of CLEC, its agents or subcontractors or CLEC’s End
User or resulting from CLEC’s improper use of AT&T-22STATE’s facilities, or due to malfunction of any facilities,
functions, products, services or equipment provided by any person or entity other than AT&T-22STATE. Upon
reimbursement for damages, AT&T-22STATE will cooperate with CLEC in prosecuting a claim against the person
causing such damage. CLEC shall be subrogated to the right of recovery by AT&T-22STATE for the damages to the
extent of such payment.
17.13 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each Party agrees that should it cause any non-standard
digital subscriber line (“xDSL”) technologies (as that term is defined in the applicable Attachment 14 - xDSL Loops
and/or the applicable Commission-ordered tariff, as appropriate) to be deployed or used in connection with or on
AT&T-22STATE facilities, that Party (“Indemnifying Party”) will pay all costs associated with any damage, service
interruption or other Telecommunications Service degradation, or damage to the other Party’s (“Indemnitee’s”)
facilities.
17.14 Indemnification Procedures:
17.14.1 Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this Section 17.0, the relevant Indemnified Party, as
appropriate, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and request in writing the Indemnifying Party to
defend the same. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that the Indemnifying Party might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices the
Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such claim.
17.14.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of the defense of such
claim and the identity of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party.

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
17.14.3 Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides written notice of acceptance of the defense of such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall defend such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to any right of
the Indemnifying Party to seek reimbursement for the costs of such defense in the event that it is
determined that Indemnifying Party had no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such claim.
17.14.4 Upon accepting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control and conduct the
defense and settlement of any such claims, subject to consultation with the Indemnified Party. So long as
the Indemnifying Party is controlling and conducting the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in
advance and agrees to be bound by the agreement incorporating such settlement.
17.14.5 At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise or settlement, and, at such
refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that, in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the refusing Party against, any cost or liability in
excess of such refused compromise or settlement.
17.14.6 With respect to any defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to
participate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the claim requests equitable relief or other relief
that could affect the rights of the Indemnified Party, and shall also be entitled to employ separate counsel for
such defense at such Indemnified Party’s expense.
17.14.7 If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any indemnified claim as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel for such defense at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party.
17.14.8 In the event of a failure to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may negotiate a settlement, which
shall be presented to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to the presented
settlement, the Indemnifying Party may take over the defense. If the Indemnifying Party refuses to agree to
the presented settlement and refuses to take over the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any
reasonable cash settlement not involving any admission of liability by the Indemnifying Party, though such
settlement may have been made by the Indemnified Party without approval of the Indemnifying Party, it
being the Parties’ intent that no settlement involving a non-monetary concession by the Indemnifying Party,
including an admission of liability by such Party, shall take effect without the written approval of the
Indemnifying Party.
17.14.9 Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause its employees and agents to cooperate with the other Party in
the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each Party shall be available to the other Party
with respect to any such defense, subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Section 22.0 below.
18.0 Performance Measures
18.1 Attachment 09 - Performance Measures specifies applicable performance standards. To the extent that remedies
are available under such Attachment, such remedies constitute the sole obligation of AT&T-22STATE to pay
damages or financial penalties for failure to meet specified performance standards identified in such Attachment and
all other Attachments to this Agreement.
19.0 Intellectual Property/License
19.1 Any Intellectual Property originating from or developed by a Party shall remain in the exclusive ownership of that
Party.
19.2 Except at otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no license under patents, copyrights or any other
Intellectual Property right (other than the limited license to use consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions
of this Agreement) is granted by either Party or shall be implied or arise by estoppel with respect to any transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.

27.0 Changes in End User Local Exchange Service Provider Selection

Operations Support Systems (OSS) restricting access to CPNI in order to immediately provide service to such End
User.

27.3 When an End User changes or withdraws authorization from its LEC, each Party shall release End User-specific
facilities belonging to the ILEC in accordance with the End User’s direction or that of the End User’s authorized
agent. Further, when an End User abandons its premise (that is, its place of business or domicile), AT&T-22STATE
is free to reclaim the 251(c)(3) UNE facilities for use by another End User and is free to issue service orders required
to reclaim such facilities.
27.4 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another Local Exchange Carrier,
including AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as network elements or as part of a resold service, and regardless of whether
the End User served with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or
otherwise. AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
27.5 Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to investigate any allegations of unauthorized changes in local
Exchange Service (slamming) at the request of the other Party; provided, however, that each Party shall cooperate

FCC or the applicable state Commission.

purchased prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement. The CLEC shall provide the Profile Codes via the
appropriate OSS, (e.g., CLEC Profile) within thirty (30) calendar days of this Agreement being approved by the
applicable Commission. CLEC shall not order products or services under this Agreement until it has provided its
Profile Codes as set forth in this Section.
29.0 Law Enforcement
29.1 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in handling law enforcement requests as
follows:
29.1.1 Intercept Devices:
29.1.1.1 Local and federal law enforcement agencies periodically request information or assistance
(“Requesting Authority”) from a Telecommunications Carrier. When either Party receives a
request (“Receiving Party”) associated with an End User of the other Party and the Receiving
Party does not provide the network end-office/loop switching functionality to such End User, the
Receiving Party will promptly notify the Requesting Authority so that the Requesting Authority
may redirect its request to the appropriate Party that provides such functionality.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party shall comply with any valid request of a
Requesting Authority to attach a pen register, trap-and-trace or form of intercept on the
Receiving Party’s Facilities.

29.1.2.1 If a Receiving Party receives a subpoena (or equivalent legal demand regardless of
nomenclature, e.g., warrant) for information concerning an End User the Receiving Party knows

information, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the person or entity that caused issuance
of such subpoena so that it may redirect its subpoena to the other Party.
29.1.3 Emergencies:
29.1.3.1 If a Receiving Party receives a request from a law enforcement agency for a temporary number
change, temporary disconnect, or one-way denial of outbound calls by the Receiving Party’s

emergency request. However, neither Party shall be held liable for any claims or Losses alleged
by the other Party’s End Users arising from compliance with such requests on behalf of the other
Party’s End User and the Party serving such End User agrees to indemnify and hold the other
Party harmless against any and all such claims or Losses.
29.2 Each of the Parties agree to comply with the applicable state and federal law enforcement authorities, laws, and
requirements, including but not limited to, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and to

create or incur any liability or any obligation of any kind, express or implied, against or in the name or on behalf of the
other Party unless otherwise expressly permitted by such other Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, no Party undertakes to perform any obligation of the other Party, whether regulatory or contractual, or to
assume any responsibility for the management of the other Party’s business.
31.0 No Third Party Beneficiaries; Disclaimer of Agency
31.1 This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or

34.0 Force Majeure
34.1 No Party shall be responsible for delays or failures in performance of any part of this Agreement (other than an
obligation to make monetary payments) resulting from a “Force Majeure Event” or any Delaying Event caused by the
other Party or any other circumstances beyond the Party’s reasonable control. A “Force Majeure Event” is defined as
acts or occurrences beyond the reasonable control of a Party or the Parties, including acts of nature, acts of civil or
military authority, any law, order, regulation, ordinance of any Governmental Authority, embargoes, epidemics,
terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, hurricanes, floods, labor
difficulties, including without limitation, strikes, slowdowns, picketing, boycotts or other work stoppages, equipment
failures, cable cuts, power blackouts, volcanic action, other major environmental disturbances, unusually severe
weather conditions, inability to secure products or services of other persons or transportation facilities or acts or
omissions of transportation carriers, individually and collectively a Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event
shall occur, the Party affected shall give notice to the other Party of such Force Majeure Event within a reasonable
period of time following such an event specifying the nature, date of inception and expected duration of such Force
Majeure Event, whereupon such obligation or performance shall be suspended to the extent such Party is affected by
such Force Majeure Event during the continuance thereof or be excused from such performance depending on the
nature, severity and duration of such Force Majeure Event (and the other Party shall likewise be excused from
performance of its obligations to the extent such Party’s obligations relate to the performance so interfered with). The
affected Party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the cause of nonperformance and the Parties shall
give like Notice and proceed to perform with dispatch once the causes are removed or cease.
35.0 Taxes
35.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 35.0, with respect to any purchase of products or services under this
Agreement, if any Tax is required or permitted by Applicable Law to be billed to and/or collected from the purchasing
Party by the providing Party, then: (i) the providing Party shall have the right to bill the purchasing Party for such
Tax; (ii) the purchasing Party shall pay such Tax to the providing Party; and (iii) the providing Party shall pay or remit
such Tax to the respective Governmental Authority. Whenever possible, Taxes shall be billed as a separate item on
the invoice; provided, however, that failure to include Taxes on an invoice or to state a Tax separately shall not impair
the obligation of the purchasing Party to pay any Tax. Nothing shall prevent the providing Party from paying any Tax
to the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to the time: (i) it bills the purchasing Party for such Tax, or (ii) it
collects the Tax from the purchasing Party. If the providing Party fails to bill the purchasing Party for a Tax at the
time of billing the products or services to which the Tax relates, then, as between the providing Party and the
purchasing Party, the providing Party shall be liable for any penalties or interest thereon. However, if the purchasing
Party fails to pay any Tax properly billed by the providing Party, then, as between the providing Party and the
purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall be solely responsible for payment of the Tax and any penalties or
interest thereon. Subject to the provisions of this Section 35.0 governing contests of disputed Taxes, the purchasing
Party shall be liable for and the providing Party may collect from the purchasing Party any Tax, including any interest
or penalties for which the purchasing Party would be liable under this subsection, which is paid by Providing Party to
the respective Governmental Authority within the applicable statue of limitations periods for assessment or collection
of such Tax, including extensions; provided, however, that the providing Party notifies the purchasing Party within the
earlier of (i) sixty (60) days following the running of such limitations period for including extensions, or (ii) six (6) years
following the purchasing Party’s payment for the products or services to which such Tax relates.
35.2 With respect to any purchase under this Agreement of products or services that are resold by the purchasing Party to
a Third Party or used as a component part of or integrated into a product or service sold to a Third Party, if any Tax is
imposed on or with respect to such sale by the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall pay or remit such Tax to
the respective Governmental Authority. If the purchasing Party fails to pay or remit any Tax as required by
Applicable Law, then, as between the providing Party and the purchasing Party, the purchasing Party shall remain
liable for such Tax and any interest and penalties thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the purchasing Party agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless (and defend at the purchasing Party’s expense)
the providing Party from and against any Tax, any interest or penalties thereon, and any costs or expenses (including
attorney fees) incurred by the providing Party as a result of any claim asserted or actions taken by the respective
Governmental Authority to assess against or collect from the providing Party any Tax related to any sale by the
purchasing Party to a third Party.

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
35.3 To the extent a purchase of products or services under this Agreement is claimed by the purchasing Party to be for
resale or otherwise exempt from a Tax, the purchasing Party shall furnish to the providing Party an exemption
certificate in the form prescribed by the providing Party and any other information or documentation required by
Applicable Law or the respective Governmental Authority. Prior to receiving such exemption certificate and any such
other required information or documentation, the Providing Party shall have the right to bill, and the Purchasing Party
shall pay, Tax on any products or services furnished hereunder as if no exemption were available, subject to the right
of the Purchasing Party to pursue a claim for credit or refund of any such Tax pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 35.0 and the remedies available under Applicable Law. If it is the position of the purchasing Party that
Applicable Law exempts or excludes a purchase of products or services under this Agreement from a Tax, or that the
Tax otherwise does not apply to such a purchase, but Applicable Law does not also provide a specific procedure for
claiming such exemption or exclusion or for the purchaser to contest the application of the Tax directly with the
respective Governmental Authority prior to payment, then the providing Party may in its discretion agree not to bill
and/or not to require payment of such Tax by the purchasing Party, provided that the purchasing Party (i) furnishes
the providing Party with any exemption certificate requested by and in the form prescribed by the providing Party, (ii)
furnishes the providing Party with a letter signed by an officer of the purchasing Party setting forth the basis of the
purchasing Party’s position under Applicable Law; and (iii) furnishes the providing Party with an indemnification
agreement, reasonably acceptable to the providing Party, which holds the providing Party harmless from any Tax,
interest, penalties, loss, cost or expenses (including attorney fees) that may be incurred by the providing Party in
connection with any claim asserted or actions taken by the respective Governmental Authority to assess or collect
such Tax from the providing Party.
35.4 To the extent permitted by and pursuant to Applicable Law, and subject to the provisions of this Section 35.0, the
purchasing Party shall have the right to contest with the respective Governmental Authority, or if necessary under
Applicable Law to have the providing Party contest (in either case at the purchasing Party’s expense) any Tax that
the purchasing Party asserts is not applicable, from which it claims an exemption or exclusion, or which it claims to
have paid in error; provided, however, that (i) the purchasing Party shall ensure that no lien is attached to any asset
of the providing Party as a result of any contest of a disputed Tax; (ii) with respect to any Tax that could be assessed
against or collected from the providing Party by the respective Governmental Authority, the providing Party shall
retain the right to determine the manner of contesting such disputed Tax, including but not limited to a decision that
the disputed Tax will be contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund; (iii) except to the extent that the providing
Party has agreed pursuant to this Section 35.0 not to bill and/or not to require payment of such Tax by the purchasing
Party pending the outcome of such contest, the purchasing Party pays any such Tax previously billed by the
providing Party and continues paying such Tax as billed by the providing Party pending the outcome of such contest.
In the event that a disputed Tax is to be contested by pursuing a claim for credit or refund, if requested in writing by
the purchasing Party, the providing Party shall facilitate such contest (i) by assigning to the purchasing Party its right
to claim a credit or refund, if such an assignment is permitted under Applicable Law; or (ii) if an assignment is not
permitted, by filing and pursuing the claim on behalf of the purchasing Party but at the purchasing Party’s expense.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 35.0, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impair,
limit, restrict or otherwise affect the right of the providing Party to contest a Tax that could be assessed against or
collected from it by the respective Governmental Authority. With respect to any contest of a disputed Tax resulting in
a refund, credit or other recovery, as between the purchasing Party and the providing Party, the purchasing Party
shall be entitled to the amount that it previously paid, plus any applicable interest allowed on the recovery that is
attributable to such amount, and the providing Party shall be entitled to all other amounts.
35.5 If either Party is audited by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority with respect to a Tax, and in any contest of a
Tax by either Party, the other Party shall cooperate fully and timely by providing records, testimony and such
additional information or assistance as may reasonably be necessary to expeditiously resolve the audit or pursue the
contest.
35.6 All Notices, affidavits, exemption certificates or other communications required or permitted to be given by either
Party to the other under this Section 35.0 shall be sent in accordance with Section 20.0 above hereof.
35.7 Municipal fees CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is required to comply with Chapter 283 of the Texas Local
Government Code, as it may be amended from time to time, and the reporting and compensation requirements of
Subchapter R of the P.U.C. Substantive Rules – Chapter 26, Applicable to Telecommunications Service Providers,

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 47 of 56
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
as they may be amended from time to time. With respect to municipal fees charged pursuant to Chapter 283, Tex.
Loc. Gov’t Code, CLEC agrees that it will directly report its access lines to the Texas Public Utility Commission, will
remit the related payments to municipalities, and will otherwise comply with Chapter 283 and applicable P.U.C rules,
as they may be amended from time to time. CLEC agrees that its failure to comply with all Chapter 283
requirements, including any failure to provide AT&T-22STATE with a valid Adequate Proof Agreement
acknowledging CLEC’s obligation to pay Municipal Fees within thirty (30) days of AT&T-22STATE’s request, shall be
considered a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle AT&T-22STATE to any and all remedies provided
elsewhere in this Agreement for such a breach, including, but not limited to suspension of all order processing (other
than disconnect orders).
36.0 Non Waiver
36.1 Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent to any
default under this Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and properly executed by or on behalf of
the Party against whom such waiver or consent is claimed. Waiver by either Party of any default by the other Party
shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default. Failure of either Party to insist on performance of any term or
condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or
future waiver of such term, condition, right or privilege. No course of dealing or failure of any Party to strictly enforce
any term, right, or condition of this Agreement in any instance shall be construed as a general waiver or
relinquishment of such term, right or condition.
37.0 Network Maintenance and Management
37.1 The Parties will work cooperatively to implement this Agreement. The Parties will exchange appropriate information
(for example, maintenance contact numbers, network information, information required to comply with law
enforcement and other security agencies of the government, escalation processes, etc.) to achieve this desired
result.
37.2 Each Party will administer its network to ensure acceptable service levels to all users of its network services. Service
levels are generally considered acceptable only when End Users are able to establish connections with little or no
delay encountered in the network. Each Party will provide a twenty four (24)-hour contact number for Network Traffic
Management issues to the other’s surveillance management center.
37.3 Each Party maintains the right to implement protective network traffic management controls, such as “cancel to”, “call
gapping” or seven (7)-digit and ten (10)-digit code gaps, to selectively cancel the completion of traffic over its
network, including traffic destined for the other Party’s network, when required to protect the public-switched network
from congestion as a result of occurrences such as facility failures, switch congestion or failure or focused overload.
Each Party shall immediately notify the other Party of any protective control action planned or executed.
37.4 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be implemented by either Party to
temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal calling patterns. Reroutes shall not be
used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Expansive controls shall be used only when mutually agreed to by the
Parties.
37.5 The Parties shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding cross-network call-ins expected to
generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events on
the public-switched network, including any disruption or loss of service to the other Party’s End Users. Facsimile
(FAX) numbers must be exchanged by the Parties to facilitate event notifications for planned mass calling events.
37.6 Neither Party shall use any Interconnection Service provided under this Agreement or any other service related
thereto or used in combination therewith in any manner that interferes with or impairs service over any facilities of
AT&T-22STATE, its affiliated companies or other connecting telecommunications carriers, prevents any carrier from
using its Telecommunications Service, impairs the quality or the privacy of Telecommunications Service to other
carriers or to either Party’s End Users, causes hazards to either Party’s personnel or the public, damage to either
Party’s or any connecting carrier’s facilities or equipment, including any malfunction of ordering or billing systems or
equipment. Upon such occurrence either Party may discontinue or refuse service, but only for so long as the other

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE

Party is violating this provision. Upon any such violation, either Party shall provide the other Party notice of the
violation at the earliest practicable time.
37.7 AT&T TENNESSEE hereby commits to provide Disaster Recovery to CLEC according to the plan below.
37.7.1 AT&T TENNESSEE Disaster Recovery Plan
37.7.2 In the unlikely event of a disaster occurring that affects AT&T TENNESSEE’s long-term ability to deliver
traffic to a CLEC, general procedures have been developed by AT&T TENNESSEE to hasten the recovery
process in accordance with the Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program established by the FCC
to identify and prioritize telecommunication services that support national security or emergency
preparedness (NS/EP) missions. A description of the TSP Program as it may be amended from time to time
is available on AT&T TENNESSEE’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. Since each location is
different and could be affected by an assortment of potential problems, a detailed recovery plan is
impractical. However, in the process of reviewing recovery activities for specific locations, some basic
procedures emerge that appear to be common in most cases.
37.7.3 These general procedures should apply to any disaster that affects the delivery of traffic for an extended
time period. Each CLEC will be given the same consideration during an outage, and service will be restored
as quickly as possible. AT&T TENNESSEE reserves the right to make changes to these procedures as
improvements become available or as business conditions dictate.
37.7.4 This plan will cover the basic recovery procedures that would apply to every CLEC.
37.7.5 Single Point of Contact:
37.7.5.1 When a problem is experienced, regardless of the severity, the AT&T TENNESSEE Network
Management Center (NMC) will observe traffic anomalies and begin monitoring the situation.
Controls will be appropriately applied to insure the sanity of AT&T TENNESSEE’s network; and,
in the event that a switch or facility node is lost, the NMC will attempt to circumvent the failure
using available reroutes.
37.7.5.2 AT&T TENNESSEE’s NMC will remain in control of the restoration efforts until the problem has
been identified as being a long-term outage. At that time, the NMC will contact AT&T
TENNESSEE’s ECC and relinquish control of the recovery efforts. Even though the ECC may
take charge of the situation, the NMC will continue to monitor the circumstances and restore
traffic as soon as damaged network elements are revitalized.
37.7.5.3 The telephone number for the AT&T TENNESSEE Network Management Center in Atlanta, as
published in Telcordia’s National Network Management Directory, is 404-321-2516.
37.7.6 Identifying the Problem:
37.7.6.1 During the early stages of problem detection, the NMC will be able to tell which CLECs are
affected by the catastrophe. Further analysis and/or first hand observation will determine if the
disaster has affected CLEC equipment only, AT&T TENNESSEE equipment only or a
combination. The initial restoration activity will be largely determined by the equipment that is
affected.
37.7.6.2 Once the nature of the disaster is determined and after verifying the cause of the problem, the
NMC will initiate reroutes and/or transfers that are jointly agreed upon by the affected CLECs’
Network Management Center and the AT&T TENNESSEE NMC. The type and percentage of
controls used will depend upon available network capacity. Controls necessary to stabilize the
situation will be invoked and the NMC will attempt to re-establish as much traffic as possible.
37.7.6.3 For long-term outages, recovery efforts will be coordinated by the ECC. Traffic controls will
continue to be applied by the NMC until facilities are re-established. As equipment is made
available for service, the ECC will instruct the NMC to begin removing the controls and allow
traffic to resume.

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
37.7.7 Site Control:
37.7.7.1 In the total loss of building use scenario, what likely exists will be a smoking pile of rubble. This
rubble will contain many components that could be dangerous. It could also contain any
personnel on the premises at the time of the disaster. For these reasons, the local fire marshal
with the assistance of the police will control the site until the building is no longer a threat to
surrounding properties and the companies have secured the site from the general public.
37.7.7.2 During this time, the majority owner of the building should be arranging for a demolition
contractor to mobilize to the site with the primary objective of reaching the cable entrance facility
for a damage assessment. The results of this assessment would then dictate immediate plans
for restoration, both short term and permanent.
37.7.7.3 In a less catastrophic event, (i.e., the building is still standing and the cable entrance facility is
usable), the situation is more complex. The site will initially be controlled by local authorities until
the threat to adjacent property has diminished. Once the site is returned to the control of the
companies, the following events should occur:
37.7.7.3.1 An initial assessment of the main building infrastructure systems (mechanical,
electrical, fire and life safety, elevators, and others) will establish building needs.
Once these needs are determined, the majority owner should lead the building
restoration efforts. There may be situations where the site will not be totally
restored within the confines of the building. The companies must individually
determine their needs and jointly assess the cost of permanent restoration to
determine the overall plan of action.
37.7.7.3.2 Multiple restoration trailers from each company will result in the need for
designated space and installation order. This layout and control is required to
maximize the amount of restoration equipment that can be placed at the site, and
the priority of placements.
37.7.7.3.3 Care must be taken in this planning to ensure other restoration efforts have
logistical access to the building. Major components of telephone and building
equipment will need to be removed and replaced. A priority for this equipment
must also be jointly established to facilitate overall site restoration. (Example: If
the AC switchgear has sustained damage, this would be of the highest priority in
order to regain power, lighting, and HVAC throughout the building.)
37.7.7.3.4 If the site will not accommodate the required restoration equipment, the companies
would then need to quickly arrange with local authorities for street closures, rights
of way or other possible options available.
37.7.8 Environmental Concerns:
37.7.8.1 In the worse case scenario, many environmental concerns must be addressed. Along with the
police and fire marshal, the state environmental protection department will be on site to monitor
the situation.
37.7.8.2 Items to be concerned with in a large central office building could include:
37.7.8.2.1 Emergency engine fuel supply. Damage to the standby equipment and the fuel
handling equipment could have created “spill” conditions that have to be handled
within state and federal regulations.
37.7.8.2.2 Asbestos-containing materials that may be spread throughout the wreckage.
Asbestos could be in many components of building, electrical, mechanical, outside
plant distribution, and telephone systems.
37.7.8.2.3 Lead and acid. These materials could be present in potentially large quantities
depending upon the extent of damage to the power room.

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 50 of 56
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
37.7.8.2.4 Mercury and other regulated compounds resident in telephone equipment.
37.7.8.2.5 Other compounds produced by the fire or heat.
37.7.8.3 Once a total loss event occurs at a large site, local authorities will control immediate clean up
(water placed on the wreckage by the fire department) and site access.
37.7.8.4 At some point, the companies will become involved with local authorities in the overall planning
associated with site clean up and restoration. Depending on the clean up approach taken,
delays in the restoration of several hours to several days may occur.
37.7.8.5 In a less severe disaster, items listed above are more defined and can be addressed individually
depending on the damage.
37.7.8.6 In each case, the majority owner should coordinate building and environmental restoration as
well as maintain proper planning and site control.
37.7.9 The ECC (Emergency Control Center):
37.7.9.1 The ECC is located in the Midtown 1 Building in Atlanta, Georgia. During an emergency, the
ECC staff will convene a group of pre-selected experts to inventory the damage and initiate
corrective actions. These experts have regional access to AT&T TENNESSEE’s personnel and
equipment and will assume control of the restoration activity anywhere in the nine-state area.
37.7.9.2 In the past, the ECC has been involved with restoration activities resulting from hurricanes, ice
storms and floods. They have demonstrated their capabilities during these calamities as well as
during outages caused by human error or equipment failures. This group has an excellent
record of restoring service as quickly as possible.
37.7.9.3 During a major disaster, the ECC may move emergency equipment to the affected location,
direct recovery efforts of local personnel and coordinate service restoration activities with the
CLECs. The ECC will attempt to restore service as quickly as possible using whatever means is
available, leaving permanent solutions, such as the replacement of damaged buildings or
equipment, for local personnel to administer.
37.7.9.4 Part of the ECC’s responsibility, after temporary equipment is in place, is to support the NMC
efforts to return service to the CLECs. Once service has been restored, the ECC will return
control of the network to normal operational organizations. Any long-term changes required after
service is restored will be made in an orderly fashion and will be conducted as normal activity.
37.7.10 Recovery Procedures:
37.7.10.1 The nature and severity of any disaster will influence the recovery procedures. One crucial
factor in determining how AT&T TENNESSEE will proceed with restoration is whether or not
AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment is incapacitated. Regardless of whose equipment is out of
service, AT&T TENNESSEE will move as quickly as possible to aid with service recovery;
however, the approach that will be taken may differ depending upon the location of the problem.
37.7.11 CLEC Outage:
37.7.11.1 For a problem limited to one CLEC (or a building with multiple CLECs), AT&T TENNESSEE has
several options available for restoring service quickly. For those CLECs that have agreements
with other CLECs, AT&T TENNESSEE can immediately start directing traffic to a provisional
CLEC for completion. This alternative is dependent upon AT&T TENNESSEE having
concurrence from the affected CLECs.
37.7.11.2 Whether or not the affected CLECs have requested a traffic transfer to another CLEC will not
impact AT&T TENNESSEE’s resolve to re-establish traffic to the original destination as quickly
as possible.
37.7.12 AT&T TENNESSEE Outage:

General Terms and Conditions/AT&T-22STATE
Page 51 of 56
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
37.7.12.1 Because AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment has varying degrees of impact on the service
provided to the CLECs, restoring service from damaged AT&T TENNESSEE equipment is
different. The outage will probably impact a number of Carriers simultaneously. However, the
ECC will be able to initiate immediate actions to correct the problem.
37.7.12.2 A disaster involving any of AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment locations could impact the CLECs,
some more than others. A disaster at a Central Office (CO) would only impact the delivery of
traffic to and from that one location, but the incident could affect many Carriers. If the CO is a
Serving Wire Center (SWC), then traffic from the entire area to those Carriers served from that
switch would also be impacted. If the switch functions as an Access Tandem, or there is a
tandem in the building, traffic from every CO to every CLEC could be interrupted. A disaster that
destroys a facility hub could disrupt various traffic flows, even though the switching equipment
may be unaffected.
37.7.12.3 The NMC would be the first group to observe a problem involving AT&T TENNESSEE’s
equipment. Shortly after a disaster, the NMC will begin applying controls and finding re-routes
for the completion of as much traffic as possible. These reroutes may involve delivering traffic to
alternate Carriers upon receiving approval from the CLECs involved. In some cases, changes in
translations will be required. If the outage is caused by the destruction of equipment, then the
ECC will assume control of the restoration.
37.7.13 Loss of a CO:
37.7.13.1 When AT&T TENNESSEE loses a CO, the ECC will
37.7.13.1.1 Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
37.7.13.1.2 Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
37.7.13.1.3 Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken
area, if necessary;
37.7.13.1.4 Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other
emergency agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or CLEC in
accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T
TENNESSEE Maintenance database prior to the emergency.
37.7.14 Loss of a CO with SWC Functions:
37.7.14.1 The loss of a CO that also serves as a SWC will be restored as described in Section 3.11.4.
37.7.15 Loss of a CO with Tandem Functions:
37.7.15.1 When AT&T TENNESSEE loses a CO building that serves as an Access Tandem and as a
SWC, the ECC will:
37.7.15.1.1 Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
37.7.15.1.2 Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
37.7.15.1.3 Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken
area, if necessary;
37.7.15.1.4 Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other
emergency agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or CLEC in
accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T
TENNESSEE Maintenance database prior to the emergency;
37.7.15.1.5 Re-direct as much traffic as possible to the alternate access tandem (if available)
for delivery to those CLECs utilizing a different location as a SWC;

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
37.7.15.1.6 Begin aggregating traffic to a location near the damaged building. From this
location, begin re-establishing trunk groups to the CLECs for the delivery of traffic
normally found on the direct trunk groups. (This aggregation point may be the
alternate access tandem location or another CO on a primary facility route.)
37.7.16 Loss of a Facility Hub:
37.7.16.1 In the event that AT&T TENNESSEE loses a facility hub, the recovery process is much the same
as above. Once the NMC has observed the problem and administered the appropriate controls,
the ECC will assume authority for the repairs. The recovery effort will include:
37.7.16.1.1 Placing specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
37.7.16.1.2 Inventorying the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
37.7.16.1.3 Moving containerized emergency equipment to the stricken area, if necessary;
37.7.16.1.4 Reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other emergency
agencies or customers served by AT&T TENNESSEE or CLEC in accordance with
the TSP priority restoration coding scheme entered in the AT&T TENNESSEE
Maintenance database prior to the emergency; and
37.7.16.1.5 If necessary, AT&T TENNESSEE will aggregate the traffic at another location and
build temporary facilities. This alternative would be viable for a location that is
destroyed and building repairs are required.
37.7.17 Combined Outage (CLEC and AT&T TENNESSEE Equipment):
37.7.17.1 In some instances, a disaster may impact AT&T TENNESSEE’s equipment as well as the
CLEC’s. This situation will be handled in much the same way as described in Section 3.14.
Since AT&T TENNESSEE and the CLEC will be utilizing temporary equipment, close
coordination will be required.
37.7.18 T1 Identification Procedures:
37.7.18.1 During the restoration of service after a disaster, AT&T TENNESSEE may be forced to
aggregate traffic for delivery to a CLEC. During this process, T1 traffic may be consolidated onto
DS3s and may become unidentifiable to the Carrier. Because resources will be limited, AT&T
TENNESSEE may be forced to “package” this traffic entirely differently than normally received by
the CLECs. Therefore, a method for identifying the T1 traffic on the DS3s and providing the
information to the Carriers is required.
37.7.19 Acronyms:
CLEC - Competitive Local Exchange Carrier
CO - Central Office (AT&T TENNESSEE)
DS3 - Facility that carries 28 T1s (672 circuits)
ECC - Emergency Control Center (AT&T TENNESSEE)
NMC - Network Management Center
SWC - Serving Wire Center (AT&T TENNESSEE switch)
T1 - Facility that carries 24 circuits
TSP - Telecommunications Service Priority
37.7.20 Hurricane Information:
37.7.20.1 During a hurricane, AT&T TENNESSEE will make every effort to keep CLECs updated on the
status of our network. Information centers will be set up throughout AT&T TENNESSEE. These
centers are not intended to be used for escalations, but rather to keep the CLEC informed of
network related issues, area damages and dispatch conditions, etc.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
3.2 Network Interconnection Architecture Plan:
3.2.1 AT&T-22STATE’s network is partly comprised of End Office Switches, Local Only Tandem Switches
(AT&T-10STATE), Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switches, Local/Access Tandem Switches and Access
Tandem Switches. AT&T-22STATE’s network architecture in any given local Exchange Area and/or LATA
can vary markedly from another local Exchange Area/LATA. Using one or more of the NIMs herein, the
Parties will agree to a physical architecture plan for a specific Interconnection area. A physical architecture
plan will, at a minimum, include the location of CLEC’s switch(es) and AT&T-22STATE’s End Office
Switch(es) and/or Tandem Switch(es) to be interconnected, the facilities that will connect the two (2)
networks and which Party will provide (be financially responsible for) the Interconnection facilities. At the
time of implementation in a given local Exchange Area or LATA the plan will be documented and signed by
appropriate representatives of the Parties, indicating their mutual agreement to the physical architecture
plan.
3.2.2 The Parties may utilize any method of Interconnection described in this Attachment. Unless otherwise
specified in this Attachment, each Party is financially responsible for the provisioning of facilities on its side
of the negotiated POI(s). Each Party is responsible for the appropriate sizing, operation and maintenance of
the transport facility to its side of the POI(s). The Parties agree to provide sufficient facilities for the trunk
groups required in Section 4.0 below for the exchange of traffic between CLEC and AT&T-22STATE.
3.2.2.1 For each NXX code used by either Party, the Party that owns the NXX (or pooled code block)
must maintain network facilities (whether owned or leased) used to actively provide, in part, local
Telecommunications Service in the geographic area assigned to such NXX code. If either Party
uses its NXX Code to provide Foreign Exchange (FX) service to its customers outside of the
geographic area assigned to such code, that Party shall be solely responsible to transport traffic
between its Foreign Exchange service customers and such code’s geographic area.
3.2.3 Types of Points of Interconnection:
3.2.3.1 A “Tandem Serving Area (TSA)” is an AT&T-22STATE area defined by the sum of all local
calling areas served by AT&T-22STATE End Offices that subtend an AT&T-22STATE Tandem
for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic as defined in the LERG.
3.2.3.2 The Parties will interconnect their network facilities at a minimum of one CLEC designated POI
within AT&T-22STATE’s network in the LATA where CLEC Offers Service.
3.2.3.3 A “Single POI” is a single point of Interconnection within a LATA on AT&T-22STATE’s network
that is established to interconnect AT&T-22STATE’s network and CLEC’s network for the
exchange of Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
3.2.3.4 The Parties agree that CLEC has the right to choose a Single POI or multiple POIs.
3.2.3.5 When CLEC has established a Single POI (or multiple POIs) in a LATA, CLEC agrees to
establish an additional POI:
3.2.3.5.1 at an AT&T-22STATE TSA separate from the existing POI arrangement when traffic
through the existing POI arrangement to that AT&T-22STATE TSA exceeds twenty-
four (24) DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive months; or
3.2.3.5.2 at an AT&T-22STATE End Office in a local calling area not served by an AT&T-
22STATE Tandem for Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic when traffic through
the existing POI arrangement to that local calling area exceeds twenty-four (24)
DS1s at peak over three (3) consecutive months.
3.2.3.6 The additional POI(s) will be established within ninety (90) calendar days of notification that the
threshold has been met.
3.2.4 A Party seeking to change the physical architecture plan shall provide thirty (30) calendar days advance
written Notice of such intent. After Notice is served, the normal project planning process as described in

3.2.5 CLEC is solely responsible, including financially, for the facilities that carry Operator Services/Directory
Assistance (“OS/DA”), E911, Mass Calling, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups.
3.2.6 Technical Interfaces:
3.2.6.1 The Interconnection facilities provided by each Party shall be formatted using either Alternate
Mark Inversion (AMI) line code with Superframe format framing or Bipolar 8-Zero Substitution
with Extended Superframe (B8ZS ESF) format framing or any mutually agreeable line coding and
framing.
3.3 Methods of Interconnection:
3.3.1 Physical and Virtual Collocation - Attachment 12 - Collocation describes the terms and conditions for
Interconnection via Collocation.
3.3.2 Leased Entrance Facilities:
3.3.2.1 When CLEC does not elect to collocate transport terminating equipment at an AT&T-22STATE
Tandem or End Office, CLEC may self provision facilities, deploy third party interconnection
facilities, or lease existing Entrance Facilities from AT&T-22STATE.
3.3.2.2 AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC existing Entrance Facilities when used solely for
interconnection purposes within the meaning of Section 251(c)(2) of the Act, i.e., for the
transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and/or exchange access service, at the
rates set forth in the Pricing Sheets. An Entrance Facility is existing if, at the time of CLEC’s
request, the facility is present in AT&T-22STATE’s network and available for use as an Entrance
Facility and no special construction is required.
3.3.2.3 CLEC may not purchase Entrance Facilities pursuant to this Agreement for any other purpose,
including, without limitation (i) as unbundled network elements under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act,
(ii) for backhauling traffic (e.g., to provide a final link in the dedicated transmission path between
CLEC’s customer and CLEC’s switch, or to carry traffic to and from its own end users), or (iii)
911, OS/DA, High Volume Call In (“HVCI”), Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups.
3.3.2.4 CLEC must submit Access Service Requests (“ASRs”) to AT&T-22STATE to perform
conversions for reclassifications of the wholesale service or group of wholesale services to an
Entrance Facility purchased pursuant to this Agreement and at the rates referenced in the Pricing
Sheets. AT&T-22STATE will follow project guidelines as described in Section 4.7.
3.3.2.5 Entrance Facility Audits:
3.3.2.5.1 AT&T-22STATE may audit CLEC’s compliance with the use of Entrance Facilities
for Interconnection purposes by obtaining and paying for an independent auditor to
audit, on no more frequently than an annual basis (consecutive 12 month period
following the commencement of an audit), CLEC’s compliance with the conditions
set forth in Sections 3.3.2.1–3.3.2.4 above (“Entrance Facility Requirements”).
3.3.2.5.2 AT&T-22STATE will send such Audit Notice to CLEC no less than thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the date upon which AT&T-22STATE seeks to commence an
audit and shall identify the independent auditor.
3.3.2.5.3 The independent auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the
standards established by the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants,
which will require the auditor to perform an “examination engagement” and issue an
opinion that includes the auditor’s determination regarding CLEC’s compliance with
the Entrance Facility Requirements.
3.3.2.5.4 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all
material respects with the Entrance Facility Requirements. AT&T-22STATE shall
provide CLEC with a copy of the independent auditor’s report within ten (10)

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
business days from the date of receipt. The independent auditor’s report shall state
the scope of the audit that was performed.
3.3.2.5.5 If the auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with the Entrance Facility
Requirements, CLEC must:
3.3.2.5.5.1 submit orders to AT&T-22STATE to either convert all noncompliant
Entrance Facilities to the equivalent or substantially similar wholesale
service or disconnect non-compliant facilities within 45 days of the
date CLEC receives a copy of the auditor’s report;
3.3.2.5.5.2 remit payment in accordance with the payment provisions of the
Agreement for true-up charges assessed by AT&T-22STATE for the
difference between the amount billed by AT&T-22STATE and the
amount that AT&T-22STATE would have billed had CLEC purchased
the Entrance Facilities from the applicable AT&T-22STATE tariff at
month-to-month rates plus late payment charges from the date that
the noncompliance of the Entrance Facility Requirements, in whole or
in part, began. AT&T-22STATE reserves its rights to make the
effective bill date for conversions 45 days after CLEC’s receipt of a
copy of the auditor’s report;
3.3.2.5.5.3 reimburse AT&T-22STATE for 100% of the cost of the independent
auditor if the number of circuits found to be non-compliant is 10% or
greater than the number of circuits investigated. If the number of
circuits found to be non-compliant is less than 10%, CLEC will
reimburse AT&T-22STATE in an amount that is in direct proportion to
the number of circuits found to be non-compliant.
3.3.2.5.6 With respect to any noncompliant Entrance Facility for which CLEC fails to submit a
conversion or disconnect order or dispute the auditor’s finding to the Commission
within such 45-day time period, AT&T-22STATE may initiate and effect such a
conversion. AT&T-22STATE will take reasonable steps to avoid disruption to
CLEC’s customers’ service or degradation in service quality in the case of
conversion. AT&T-22STATE reserves its rights to make the effective bill date for
conversions 45 days after CLEC’s receipt of a copy of the auditor’s report. In no
event shall rates set under Section 252(d)(1) apply for the use of any Entrance
Facility for any period in which the Entrance Facility does not meet the Entrance
Facility Requirements.
3.3.2.5.7 If CLEC disagrees as to the findings or conclusions of the auditor’s report, CLEC
shall provide Notice requesting dispute resolution to AT&T-22STATE. Such dispute
resolution discussions shall be completed with fourteen (14) days. The Dispute
Resolution process set forth in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement
shall not apply to a dispute of the findings or conclusions of the auditor’s report. At
the conclusion of this fourteen (14) day period, CLEC may file a complaint at the
Commission.
3.3.2.5.8 If CLEC initiates a proceeding at the Commission, CLEC may elect to pay into an
escrow account the true up amount, and on a monthly basis prospectively the
difference between the rates set forth in the Agreement and the month-to-month
rates in the applicable AT&T-22STATE tariff in lieu of AT&T converting the Entrance
Facilities identified in CLEC’s dispute resolution before the Commission pending
resolution. If the Commission upholds the auditor’s finding, the disputed amounts
held in escrow shall be paid to AT&T-22STATE and AT&T-22STATE shall retain
any disputed amounts already paid by CLEC in addition to late payment charges.

3.3.3 Fiber Meet Point:
3.3.3.1 Fiber Meet Point between AT&T-22STATE and CLEC can occur at any mutually agreeable and
technically feasible point at an AT&T-22STATE Tandem or End Office building within each
LATA.
3.3.3.2 When the Parties agree to Interconnect their networks pursuant to the Fiber Meet Point, a single
point-to-point linear chain SONET system must be utilized (in a Unidirectional Path Switched
Ring (UPSR) software configuration for AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE). Only Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be provisioned over this jointly provided facility.
3.3.3.3 Neither Party will be allowed to access the Data Communications Channel (DCC) of the other
Party’s Fiber Optic Terminal (FOT). The Fiber Meet Point will be designed so that each Party
may, as far as is technically feasible, independently select the transmission, multiplexing and
fiber terminating equipment to be used on its side of the POI(s). The Parties will work
cooperatively to achieve equipment and vendor compatibility of the FOT equipment.
3.3.3.4 Requirements for Interconnection specifications will be defined in joint engineering planning
sessions between the Parties.
3.3.3.5 In addition to the semi-annual trunk forecast process, discussed in Section 4.0 below,
discussions to provide relief to existing facilities can be initiated by either Party. Actual system
augmentations will be initiated only upon mutual agreement. Facilities will be planned to
accommodate the verified and agreed upon trunk forecast for the Local Interconnection Trunk
Group(s).
3.3.3.6 The Parties will negotiate a project service date and corresponding work schedule to construct
relief facilities prior to facilities exhaust.
3.3.3.7 CLEC will provide fiber cable to the last entrance (or AT&T-22STATE designated) manhole at
the AT&T-22STATE Tandem or End Office building. AT&T-22STATE shall make all necessary
preparations in the manhole to receive and to allow and enable CLEC to deliver fiber optic
facilities into that manhole. CLEC will provide a sufficient length of fiber cable for AT&T-
22STATE to pull through to the AT&T-22STATE cable vault. CLEC shall deliver and maintain
such strands at its own expense up to the POI. AT&T shall take the fiber from the manhole and
terminate it inside AT&T-22STATE’s Tandem or End Office building at the cable vault at AT&T-
22STATE’s expense. In this case, the POI shall be at the AT&T-22STATE designated manhole
location. Each Party shall provide its own source for the synchronized timing of its FOT
equipment.
3.3.3.8 CLEC and AT&T-22STATE will mutually agree on the capacity of the FOT(s) to be utilized based
on equivalent DS1s or DS3s. Each Party will also agree upon the optical frequency and
wavelength necessary to implement the Interconnection. The Parties will develop and agree
upon methods for the capacity planning and management for these facilities, terms and
conditions for over provisioning facilities and the necessary processes to implement facilities as
indicated in Section 4.0 below of this document.
3.3.3.9 Electrical handoffs for Fiber Meet Point will be at the DS1 or DS3 level. When a DS3 handoff is
agreed to by the Parties, AT&T-22STATE will provide any multiplexing required for DS1 facilities
or trunking at its end and CLEC will provide any DS1 multiplexing required for facilities or trunking
at its end.
3.4 Responsibilities of the Parties:
3.4.1 For each local Interconnection within an AT&T-22STATE area, CLEC shall provide written notice to AT&T-
22STATE of the need to establish Interconnection in each local Exchange Area (AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE) or LATA (AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE, AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT). CLEC shall provide all applicable

network information on forms acceptable to AT&T-22STATE (as set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC
Handbook, published on the AT&T CLEC Online website).
3.4.2 Upon receipt of CLEC’s Notice to interconnect, the Parties shall schedule a meeting to document the
network architecture (including trunking) as discussed in Section 3.2.1 above. The Interconnection
Activation Date for an Interconnection shall be established based on then-existing force and load, the scope
and complexity of the requested Interconnection and other relevant factors.
3.4.3 Either Party may add or remove switches. The Parties shall provide one hundred and twenty (120) calendar
days written Notice to establish such Interconnection; and the terms and conditions of this Attachment will
apply to such Interconnection.
3.4.4 The Parties recognize that a facility handoff point must be agreed upon to establish the demarcation point
for maintenance and provisioning responsibilities for each Party on its side of the POI.
4.0 Interconnection Trunking
4.1 Provisioning and Administration of Trunk Groups:
4.1.1 CLEC shall issue ASRs for two-way trunk groups and for one-way trunk groups originating at CLEC’s
switch. AT&T-22STATE shall issue ASRs for one-way trunk groups originating at the AT&T-22STATE
switch.
4.1.2 Trunk groups for ancillary services (e.g., OS/DA, BLVI, High Volume Call In and E911) and Meet Point or
Third Party (as appropriate) Trunk Groups can be established between CLEC’s switch and the appropriate
AT&T-22STATE Tandem Switch as further provided in this Section 4.0.
4.1.3 Signaling Protocol:
4.1.3.1 SS7 Signaling is AT&T-22STATE’s preferred method for signaling. Where MF signaling is
currently used, the Parties agree to use their best efforts to convert to SS7. If SS7 services are
provided by AT&T-22STATE, they will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable access tariffs.
4.1.3.2 Where MF signaling is currently used, the Parties agree to interconnect their networks using MF
or dual tone MF (DTMF) signaling, subject to availability at the End Office Switch or Tandem
Switch at which Interconnection occurs. The Parties acknowledge that the use of MF signaling
may not be optimal. AT&T-22STATE will not be responsible for correcting any undesirable
characteristics, service problems or performance problems that are associated with MF/SS7
inter-working or the signaling protocol required for Interconnection with CLEC employing MF
signaling.
4.1.4 The number of digits to be exchanged by the Parties shall be ten (10) unless otherwise mutually agreed.
4.1.5 Where available, a trunk group utilization report (TIKI) may be accessed from the AT&T CLEC Online
website. The report is provided in an MS-Excel format.
4.2 Embedded Base-One-Way trunks (AT&T-12STATE only):
4.2.1 AT&T-12STATE acknowledges that CLEC may have an embedded base of one-way trunks ordered and
installed prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement that were used for termination of CLEC’s Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic to AT&T-12STATE (Embedded Base). To the extent that CLEC has such
an Embedded Base, CLEC shall only augment trunk groups in the Embedded Base with the mutual
agreement of the Parties. CLEC shall not order any new one-way trunk groups following the Effective Date
of this Agreement. Moreover, the Parties agree that the Embedded Base will be converted to two-way trunk
groups under the following circumstances:
4.2.1.1 With reasonable notification from AT&T-12STATE and upon AT&T-12STATE’s request, CLEC
shall convert all of its Embedded Base to two-way trunks.

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 11 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
4.2.1.2 At any time an Embedded Base trunk group (either originating or terminating) requires
augmentation, AT&T-12STATE can require the associated originating and terminating trunks to
be converted to a single two-way trunk group prior to the augmentation.
4.2.1.3 When any network changes are to be performed on a project basis (i.e., central office
conversions, tandem re-homes, etc.), upon request and reasonable notice by AT&T-12STATE,
CLEC will convert all of its Embedded Base affected by the project within the intervals and due
dates required by the project parameters.
4.2.1.4 In addition to the foregoing, CLEC may choose, at any time, to convert its Embedded Base to
two-way trunk groups.
4.2.1.5 The Parties will coordinate any trunk group migration, trunk group prioritization and
implementation schedule. AT&T-12STATE agrees to develop a cutover plan within thirty (30)
days of notification to CLEC of the need to convert pursuant to Section 4.2.1.1 above and Section
4.2.1.3 above.
4.3 Establishment of Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Groups Per Region:
4.3.1 When CLEC Offers Service in a Local Exchange Area or LATA, the following trunk groups described in this
Section 4.3 shall be used to transport traffic between CLEC End Users and AT&T-22STATE End Users.
4.3.2 Local Only and Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each Local Exchange Area: AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE. These trunk groups will utilize SS7 where available and multi-frequency (MF) signaling
protocol where SS7 is not available.
4.3.2.1 A two-way Local Only Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch in the local Exchange Area. Inter-
Tandem switching is not provided.
4.3.2.2 A two-way Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established between CLEC’s switch and
each AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Local/IntraLATA Tandem Switch and each
Local/Access Tandem Switch in the local Exchange Area. Inter-Tandem switching is not
provided.
4.3.2.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE reserves the right to initiate a one-way IntraLATA Trunk
Group to CLEC in order to provide Tandem relief when a community of interest is outside the
local Exchange Area in which CLEC is interconnected.
4.3.2.4 Where traffic from CLEC switch to an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office is
sufficient (24 or more trunks), a Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall also be established to
the AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office. Once such trunks are provisioned,
traffic from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE must be redirected to route first to
the Direct End Office Trunk Group (DEOT) with overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate
AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic. If an AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic,
a direct final DEOT will be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.3.2.5 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s switch to each AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End Office in a local Exchange Area that has no Local
Tandem. This trunk group shall be established as a direct final.
4.3.2.6 When AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has a separate Local Only Tandem Switch(es) in
the local Exchange Area and a separate Access Tandem Switch that serves the same local
Exchange Area, a two-way IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group shall be established to the AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE Access Tandem Switch. In addition a two-way Local Only

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 12 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
Trunk Group(s) shall be established from CLEC’s switch to each AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION
5-STATE Local Only Tandem Switch.
4.3.2.7 Each Party shall deliver to the other Party over the Local Only Trunk Group(s) only such traffic
that originates and terminates in the same local exchange area.
4.3.3 Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group(s) in each LATA: AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE and AT&T
CONNECTICUT:
4.3.3.1 Tandem Trunking - AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE:
4.3.3.1.1 Section 251(b)(5) and ISP Bound Traffic shall be routed on Local Only Trunk Groups
established at all AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-
STATE Local Only Tandems in the LATA for calls destined to or from all AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE End Offices that subtend the designated Tandem.
These trunk groups shall be two-way and will utilize SS7 signaling.
4.3.3.1.2 In AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE all
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on two-way Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups using SS7 signaling. These trunk groups shall be
established at all Local/IntraLATA and Local/Access Tandem switches in AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and at the Access Tandem Switches in AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE in the LATA, for calls destined to or from End Offices that
subtend each Tandem.
4.3.3.1.3 A Local Interconnection Trunk Group shall be established from CLEC’s switch to
each AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and each AT&T WEST REGION 2-
STATE End Office in any LATA where the AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and
AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE End Office does not subtend an AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE Local Tandem. This trunk
group shall be established as a direct final.
4.3.3.2 Tandem Trunking - AT&T CONNECTICUT:
4.3.3.2.1 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups established at all AT&T CONNECTICUT Access Tandems in the
LATA for calls destined to or from all AT&T CONNECTICUT End Offices that
subtend the designated Tandem. These trunk groups shall be one-way and will
utilize SS7 signaling.
4.3.3.2.2 Local Interconnection Trunk Groups in AT&T CONNECTICUT shall be ordered and
provisioned as one-way to accommodate billing and technical limitations.
4.3.3.3 Tandem Trunking - AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE:
4.3.3.3.1 Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be routed on Local Interconnection
Trunk Groups established at each AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access
Tandem in the LATA where CLEC homes its NPA/NXX codes for calls destined to or
from all AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE End Offices that subtend the
designated Tandem. These trunk groups shall be one-way except where two-way
trunks have been mutually agreed and will utilize SS7 signaling. Where CLEC does
not interconnect at every Access Tandem switch location in the LATA, CLEC must
use Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic to End Users through those
Tandems within the LATA to which CLEC is not interconnected. To utilize MTA,
CLEC must establish Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to a minimum of one (1)
Access Tandem within each LATA as required. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE will route CLEC originated 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll traffic for LATA-wide
transport and termination. Compensation for MTA is described in Section 6.4 below.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
4.3.4 Direct End Office Trunking:
4.3.4.1 DEOTs transport Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic between CLEC’s switch and an AT&T-
22STATE End Office and are not switched at a Tandem location. When actual or projected End
Office Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks CLEC
shall establish the following:
4.3.4.1.1 a two-way DEOT in AT&T-12STATE;
4.3.4.1.2 a one-way DEOT in AT&T CONNECTICUT;
4.3.4.1.3 a one-way DEOT in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE (except where the
parties have agreed to use two-way trunks.)
4.3.4.2 Once such trunks are provisioned, traffic from CLEC to AT&T-22STATE must be redirected to
route first to the DEOT with overflow traffic alternate routed to the appropriate AT&T-22STATE
Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. If an AT&T-22STATE End Office
does not subtend an AT&T-22STATE Tandem that switches Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll
Traffic, a direct final DEOT will be established by CLEC and there will be no overflow of Section
251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.3.4.3 All traffic received by AT&T-22STATE on the DEOT from CLEC must terminate in the End Office,
(i.e., no Tandem switching will be performed in the End Office). Where End Office functionality is
provided in a remote End Office switch of a host/remote configuration, CLEC shall establish the
DEOT at the host switch.
4.3.5 Meet Point Trunk Group - AT&T-13STATE:
4.3.5.1 IXC carried traffic shall be transported between CLEC’s switch and the AT&T-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch over a Meet Point Trunk Group separate from
Section 251(b)(5)/IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The Meet Point Trunk Group will be established for the
transmission and routing of exchange access traffic between CLEC’s End Users and IXCs via an
AT&T-13STATE Access Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.5.2 Meet Point Trunk Groups shall be provisioned as two-way and each Party is responsible for
delivering traffic utilizing SS7 signaling, except MF signaling will be used on a separate Meet
Point Trunk Group to complete originating calls to switched access customers that use MF FGD
signaling protocol.
4.3.5.3 When AT&T-13STATE has more than one Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch in a local
exchange area or LATA, CLEC shall establish a Meet Point Trunk Group to every AT&T-
13STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch where CLEC has homed its NXX code(s) or is
the code holder of a pooled code block.
4.3.5.4 AT&T-13STATE will not block switched access traffic delivered to any AT&T-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch for completion on CLEC’s network. The Parties
understand and agree that Meet Point trunking arrangements are available and functional only
to/from switched access customers who directly connect with any AT&T-13STATE Access
Tandem Switch or Local/Access Tandem Switch that CLEC’s switch subtends in each LATA. In
no event will AT&T-13STATE be required to route such traffic through more than one of its
Tandem Switches for connection to/from switched access customers. AT&T-13STATE shall
have no responsibility to ensure that any switched access customer will accept traffic that CLEC
directs to the switched access customer.
4.3.5.5 CLEC shall provide all SS7 signaling information including, without limitation, charge number and
originating line information (OLI). For terminating FGD, AT&T-13STATE will pass all SS7
signaling information including, without limitation, Calling Party Number (CPN) if it receives CPN
from FGD carriers. All privacy indicators will be honored. Where available, network signaling
information such as transit network selection (TNS) parameter, carrier identification codes (CIC)

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
(CCS platform) and CIC/OZZ information (non SS7 environment) will be provided by CLEC
wherever such information is needed for call routing or billing. The Parties will follow all Ordering
and Billing Forum (OBF) adopted standards pertaining to TNS and CIC/OZZ codes.
4.3.5.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access Traffic shall be
delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating Party’s
access tariff(s).
4.3.6 Third Party Trunk Group - AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE:
4.3.6.1 Third Party Traffic trunks shall be two-way trunks and must be ordered by CLEC to deliver and
receive Third Party Traffic. Establishing Third Party Traffic trunks at Access and Local Tandems
provides Intra-Tandem Access to the Third Party also interconnected at those Tandems. CLEC
shall be responsible for all recurring and nonrecurring charges associated with Third Party Traffic
trunks and facilities.
4.3.7 800/(8YY) Traffic - AT&T-22STATE:
4.3.7.1 If CLEC chooses AT&T-22STATE to handle 800/(8YY) database queries from AT&T-22STATE’s
switches, all CLEC originating 800/(8YY) traffic will be routed over the Meet Point Trunk Groups
or the Third Party Trunk Groups. This traffic will include a combination of both IXC 800/(8YY)
service and CLEC 800/(8YY) service which will be identified and segregated by carrier through
the database query function in the AT&T-22STATE Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch.
4.3.7.2 Where CLEC requests that AT&T-22STATE perform the Service Switching Point (SSP) function
(e.g., the database query) on originating Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls, all such calls shall be
delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk Group or over the Third Party Trunk
Group. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit Code (to be determined for each LATA) shall be used for
all such calls.
4.3.7.3 CLEC may handle its own 800/(8YY) database queries from its own switch. Where it does so,
CLEC will determine the nature of the 800/(8YY) call (local/intraLATA or IXC-carried) based on
the response from the database. If the query determines that the call is a local or IntraLATA
800/(8YY) number, CLEC will route the post-query local or IntraLATA converted ten-digit local
number to AT&T-22STATE over the Local Interconnection Trunk Group and shall provide an
800/(8YY) billing Record to AT&T-22STATE. If the query reveals the call is an IXC-carried
800/(8YY) number, CLEC shall route the post-query IXC-carried call (800/(8YY) number) directly
from its switch for carriers interconnected with its network or over the Meet Point Trunk Group or
Third Party Trunk Group, as appropriate, to carriers not directly connected to its network but
which are connected to AT&T-22STATE’s Access or Local/Access Tandem Switch. Calls will be
routed to AT&T-22STATE over the appropriate trunk group as defined above, within the LATA in
which the calls originate.
4.3.7.4 All post-query Toll Free Service 800/(8YY) calls for which CLEC performs the SSP function, if
delivered to AT&T-22STATE, shall be delivered using GR-394 format over the Meet Point Trunk
Group or over the Third Party Trunk Group for calls destined to IXCs, or shall be delivered by
CLEC using GR-317 format over the Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Group for
calls destined to End Offices that directly subtend the Tandem.
4.3.8 E911 Trunk Group:
4.3.8.1 Attachment 05 - 911/E911 specifies E911 trunk group requirements.
4.3.9 High Volume Call In (HVCI)/Mass Calling (Choke) Trunk Group - AT&T-21STATE:
4.3.9.1 CLEC must establish a dedicated trunk group to the designated Public Response HVCI/Mass
Calling Network Access Tandem in each Serving Area. This trunk group shall be one-way
outgoing only and shall utilize MF signaling. As the HVCI/Mass Calling trunk group is designed
to block all excessive attempts toward HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs, it is necessarily exempt from

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 15 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
the one percent (1%) blocking standard described elsewhere in this Attachment. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group. The Parties
will not exchange live traffic until successful testing is completed by both Parties.
4.3.9.1.1 Upon demonstration that the CLEC switch is unable to utilize MF signaling, the
CLEC may utilize SS7 signaling for its HVCI/Mass Calling Trunk Group.
4.3.9.2 The HVCI trunk group shall be sized as follows:
Number of Access Lines Served Number of Mass Calling Trunks
0 – 10,000 2
10,001 – 20,000 3
20,001 – 30,000 4
30,001 – 40,000 5
40,001 – 50,000 6
50,001 – 60,000 7
60,001 – 75,000 8
75,000 + 9 maximum
4.3.9.3 If CLEC should acquire a HVCI/Mass Calling customer, (e.g., a radio station) CLEC shall notify
AT&T-21STATE at least sixty (60) days in advance of the need to establish a one-way outgoing
SS7 or MF trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE HVCI/Mass Calling Serving Office to the CLEC
End User’s serving office. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs
on this one-way trunk group.
4.3.9.4 If CLEC finds it necessary to issue a new choke telephone number to a new or existing
HVCI/Mass Calling customer, CLEC may request a meeting to coordinate with AT&T-21STATE
the assignment of the HVCI/Mass Calling telephone number from the existing choke NXX. In the
event that the CLEC establishes a new choke NXX, CLEC must notify AT&T-21STATE a
minimum of ninety (90) days prior to deployment of the new HVCI/Mass Calling NXX. AT&T-
21STATE will perform the necessary translations in its End Offices and Tandem(s) and issue
ASRs to establish a one-way outgoing SS7 or MF trunk group from the AT&T-21STATE Public
Response HVCI/Mass Calling Network Access Tandem to CLEC’s choke serving office.
4.3.9.5 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, where HVCI/Mass Calling NXXs have not been established, the
Parties agree to utilize “call gapping” as the method to control high volumes of calls, where
technically feasible in the originating switch, to specific high volume customers or in situations
such as those described in Network Maintenance and Management of the General Terms and
Conditions.
4.3.10 Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services Trunk Group(s):
4.3.10.1 Attachment 06 - Customer Information Services specifies the trunk group requirements for
Operator Services/Directory Assistance/Inward Assistance Operator Services.
4.4 Trunk Forecasting Responsibilities:
4.4.1 CLEC agrees to provide an initial forecast for all trunk groups described in this Attachment. AT&T-
22STATE shall review this trunk forecast and provide any additional information that may impact the trunk
forecast information provided by CLEC. Subsequent trunk forecasts shall be provided on a semi-annual
basis, not later than January 1st and July 1st of each year in order to be considered in the semi-annual
publication of the AT&T-22STATE General Trunk Forecast. Parties agree to the use of Common Language
Location Identification (CLLI) coding and Common Language Circuit Identification for Message Trunk coding
(CLCI-MSG) which is described in TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES documents BR795-100-100 and BR795-
400-100 respectively. Inquiries pertaining to use of TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Common Language

2673.
4.4.2 The semi-annual forecasts shall include:
4.4.2.1 Yearly forecasted trunk quantities for all trunk groups required in this Attachment for a minimum
of three (3) (current plus two (2) future) years; and
4.4.2.2 A description of major network projects anticipated for the next six (6) months. Major network
projects include trunking or network rearrangements, shifts in anticipated traffic patterns, orders
greater than eight (8) DS1s, or other activities that are reflected by a significant increase or
decrease in trunking demand for the following forecasting period.
4.4.2.3 The Parties shall agree on these forecasts to ensure efficient trunk utilization. For forecast
quantities that are in dispute, the Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to develop a mutually
agreeable forecast.
4.4.2.4 Orders for trunks that exceed forecasted quantities for forecasted locations will be
accommodated as mutually agreed to by the Parties. The Parties shall make all reasonable
efforts and cooperate in good faith to develop alternative solutions to accommodate these orders.
4.4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting two-way trunk groups. AT&T-22STATE shall be responsible for
forecasting the one-way trunk groups terminating to CLEC and CLEC shall be responsible for forecasting
the one-way trunk groups terminating to AT&T-22STATE, unless otherwise specified in this Attachment.
4.4.4 Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact for planning and forecasting purposes.
4.5 Trunk Design Blocking Criteria:
4.5.1 Trunk requirements for forecasting and servicing shall be based on the blocking objectives shown in Table
1. Trunk requirements shall be based upon time consistent average busy season busy hour twenty (20) day
averaged loads applied to industry standard Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity algorithms (using
Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness factor until actual traffic data is available).
Trunk Group Type Design Blocking Objective
Local Interconnection Trunk Group – Direct End Office (Primary High) ECCS1
Local Interconnection Trunk Group – Direct End Office (Final) 2%
IntraLATA Toll Trunk Group (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) 1%
Local Interconnection Trunk Group (Local Tandem) 1%
Meet Point (Local/Access or Access Tandem Switch) (AT&T-13STATE 0.5%
only)
E911 1%
Operator Services (DA/DACC) 1%
Operator Services (0+, 0-) 1%
Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt 1%
Third Party (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE only) 1%
Table 1
4.6 Trunk Servicing:
4.6.1 Both Parties will jointly manage the capacity of Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet
Point Trunk Groups. Either Party may send a Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to the other Party to
trigger changes to the Local Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups based
on capacity assessment. The TGSR is a standard industry support interface developed by the OBF of the
Carrier Liaison Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions (ATIS) organization.
1 During implementation the Parties will mutually agree on an Economic Centum Call Seconds (ECCS) or some other means for the sizing of this trunk group.

TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES Special Report STS000316 describes the format and use of the TGSR.
Contact TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES at 1-800-521-2673 regarding the documentation availability and
use of this form.
4.6.2 Orders greater than eight (8) DS1s shall be submitted as a project as described in Section 4.7 below.
4.6.3 Utilization: Utilization shall be defined as Trunks Required as a percentage of Trunks In Service.
4.6.3.1 In A Blocking Situation (Over-utilization):
4.6.3.1.1 In a blocking situation, CLEC is responsible for issuing ASRs on all two-way Local
Only, Local Interconnection, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups and one-way
CLEC originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups to reduce
measured blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis of trunk
group data. If an ASR is not issued, AT&T-22STATE will issue a TGSR. CLEC will
issue an ASR within three (3) business days after receipt and review of the TGSR.
CLEC will note “Service Affecting” on the ASR.
4.6.3.1.2 In a blocking situation, AT&T-22STATE is responsible for issuing ASRs on one-way
AT&T-22STATE originating Local Only and/or Local Interconnection Trunk Groups
to reduce measured blocking to design objective blocking levels based on analysis
of trunk group data. If an ASR is not issued, CLEC will issue a TGSR. AT&T-
22STATE will issue an ASR within three (3) business days after receipt and review
of the TGSR.
4.6.3.1.3 If an alternate final Local Only Trunk Group or Local Interconnection Trunk Group is
at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC for the final
trunk group and all subtending high usage trunk groups that are contributing any
amount of overflow to the alternate final route.
4.6.3.1.4 If a direct final Meet Point Trunk Group is at seventy-five percent (75%) utilization, a
TGSR may be sent to CLEC. If a direct final Third Party Trunk Group is at ninety
percent (90%) utilization, a TGSR may be sent to CLEC.
4.6.3.2 Underutilization:
4.6.3.2.1 Underutilization of Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups,
Third Party Trunk Group and Meet Point Trunk Groups exists when provisioned
capacity is greater than the current need. Those situations where more capacity
exists than actual usage requires will be handled in the following manner:
4.6.3.2.1.1 If a Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk Group, Third
Party Trunk Group or a Meet Point Trunk Group is under sixty-five
percent (65%) of CCS capacity on a monthly average basis for AT&T-
13STATE or under eighty percent (80%) for AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE, for each month of any three (3) consecutive
months period, either Party may request the issuance of an order to
resize the Local Only Trunk Group, Local Interconnection Trunk
Group, Third Party Trunk Group or the Meet Point Trunk Group, which
shall be left with not less than twenty-five percent (25%) excess
capacity for AT&T-13STATE or not less than fifteen percent (15%) for
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. In all cases, grade of
service objectives shall be maintained.
4.6.3.2.1.2 Either Party may send a TGSR to the other Party to trigger changes to
the Local Only Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups,
Third Party Trunk Groups or Meet Point Trunk Groups based on
capacity assessment. Upon receipt of a TGSR, the receiving Party

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 18 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
will issue an ASR to the other Party within twenty (20) business days
after receipt of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.3 Upon review of the TGSR, if a Party does not agree with the resizing,
the Parties will schedule a joint planning discussion within the twenty
(20) business days. The Parties will meet to resolve and mutually
agree to the disposition of the TGSR.
4.6.3.2.1.4 If AT&T-22STATE does not receive an ASR, or if CLEC does not
respond to the TGSR by scheduling a joint discussion within the
twenty (20) business day period, AT&T-22STATE will attempt to
contact CLEC to schedule a joint planning discussion. If CLEC will
not agree to meet within an additional five (5) business days and
present adequate reason for keeping trunks operational, AT&T-
22STATE reserves the right to issue ASRs to resize the Local Only
Trunk Groups, Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, Third Party Trunk
Groups or Meet Point Trunk Groups.
4.6.4 The Parties will process trunk service requests submitted via a properly completed ASR within ten (10)
business days of receipt of such ASR unless defined as a major project. Incoming orders will be screened
by AT&T-22STATE for reasonableness based upon current utilization and/or consistency with forecasts. If
the nature and necessity of an order requires determination, the ASR will be placed in held status and a joint
planning discussion conducted. The Parties agree to expedite this discussion in order to minimize delay in
order processing. Extension of this review and discussion process beyond two (2) Business Days from ASR
receipt will require the ordering Party to supplement the order with proportionally adjusted Customer Desired
Due Dates. Facilities must also be in place before trunk orders can be completed.
4.7 Projects:
4.7.1 Projects require the coordination and execution of multiple orders or related activities between and among
AT&T-22STATE and CLEC work groups, including but not limited to the initial establishment of Local Only,
Local Interconnection, Third Party or Meet Point Trunk Groups and service in an area, NXX code moves,
rehomes, facility grooming, or network rearrangements.
4.7.1.1 Orders that comprise a project (i.e., greater than eight (8) DS1s) shall be submitted at the same
time and their implementation shall be jointly planned and coordinated.
4.7.2 Projects - Tandem Rehomes/Switch Conversion/Major Network Projects:
4.7.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will advise CLEC of all projects significantly affecting CLEC trunking. Such
projects may include Tandem Rehomes, Switch Conversions and other major network changes.
An Accessible Letter with project details will be issued at least six (6) months prior to the project
due dates. AT&T-22STATE may follow with a TGSR approximately four (4) to six (6) months
before the due date of the project. A separate TGSR will be issued for each CLEC trunk group
and will specify the required CLEC ASR issue date. Failure to submit ASR(s) by the required
date may result in AT&T-22STATE ceasing to deliver traffic until the ASR(s) are received and
processed.
5.0 Out of Exchange Traffic
5.1 Interconnection services are available for the purposes of exchanging traffic to/from a non-AT&T-22STATE
incumbent exchange in accordance with this Section 5.0.
5.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-22STATE is only obligated to make available Interconnection under
Section 251(c)(2) of the Act to CLEC at technically feasible points within AT&T-22STATE’s network and not in
locations, such as territories of other ILECs, where AT&T-22STATE does not maintain a network. Other
Attachments to this Agreement set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE agrees to
provide CLEC with access to Unbundled Network Elements under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, Collocation under

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and/or Resale under Section 251(c)(4) of the Act in AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local
Exchange Areas for the provision of CLEC’s Telecommunications Services.
5.3 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC intends to operate and/or provide Telecommunications Services outside of
AT&T-22STATE incumbent local Exchange Areas and desires to interconnect OE-LEC’s network with AT&T-
22STATE’s network(s).
5.4 For purposes of this Attachment, OE-LEC agrees to interconnect with AT&T-22STATE pursuant to Section 251(a) of
the Act.
5.5 Network Connections For Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.5.1 OE-LEC represents that it operates as a CLEC within AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas and has a POI
located within AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas for the purpose of providing telephone Exchange Service
and Exchange Access in such AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas. Based upon the foregoing, the Parties
agree that AT&T-22STATE’s originating traffic will be delivered to OE-LEC’s existing POI arrangements in
the LATA where the traffic originates in accordance with the POI requirements set forth in this Agreement.
AT&T-22STATE will accept OE-LEC’s Out of Exchange Traffic at its Tandem Switch over local
interconnection facilities that currently exist or may exist in the future between the Parties to or from OE-
LEC’s out of Exchange Areas to or from AT&T-22STATE’s End Offices. When such Out of Exchange
Traffic is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic that is exchanged
between the End Users of OE-LEC and AT&T-22STATE, the Parties agree to establish a direct End Office
trunk group when traffic levels exceed one DS1 (24 DS0s) to or from an AT&T-22STATE End Office.
5.5.2 OE-LEC shall establish a trunk group for Out of Exchange Traffic from OE-LEC to each AT&T-22STATE
serving Tandem in a LATA. This requirement may be waived upon mutual agreement of the Parties.
5.5.2.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, where CLEC does not interconnect at every AT&T
serving Tandem in a LATA, CLEC must use Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) to route traffic in
accordance with Section 4.3.3.3.1 above.
5.5.3 Transport facilities for 911, Mass Calling, OS/DA, Third Party and Meet Point Trunk Groups are the
responsibility of OE-LEC from OE-LEC to the serving Tandem or platform that provides each such service
type.
5.5.4 OE-LEC shall route originating Out of Exchange Traffic to the serving Tandem as defined by the Tandem
owner in the LERG.
5.5.5 If AT&T-22STATE is not the serving Tandem as reflected in the LERG, the OE-LEC shall route Out of
Exchange Traffic directly to the serving AT&T-22STATE End Office.
5.5.6 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.0, for OE-LEC originated/AT&T-22STATE terminated traffic
or AT&T-22STATE originated/ OE-LEC terminated traffic, if any such traffic is improperly routed by one
Party over any trunk groups to the other Party and/or not routed in accordance with this Section 5.0, the
Parties will work cooperatively to correct the problem.
5.5.7 AT&T-22STATE shall not compensate any Third Party Local Exchange Carrier and/or Telecommunications
Carrier for any traffic that is inappropriately routed to AT&T-22STATE (as reflected in the LERG). The
obligation to correctly route traffic also includes traffic that is destined to End Offices that do not subtend an
AT&T-22STATE Tandem. Any compensation due AT&T-22STATE for such misrouted traffic shall be paid
by OE-LEC. AT&T-22STATE shall provide notice to OE-LEC pursuant to the Notices provisions of this
Agreement that such misrouting has occurred. In the notice, OE-LEC shall be given thirty (30) calendar
days to cure such misrouting.
5.5.8 Neither Party shall deliver traffic destined to terminate at the other Party’s End Office via a Third Party
ILEC’s End Office or Tandem.
5.5.9 Connection of a trunk group from OE-LEC to AT&T-22STATE’s Tandem(s) will provide OE-LEC access to
End Offices, IXCs, LECs, CMRS providers and NXXs which subtend that Tandem(s). Connection of a trunk
group from one Party to the other Party’s End Office(s) will provide the connecting Party access only to the

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 20 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
NXXs served by that individual End Office(s) to which the connecting Party interconnects. Direct End Office
Trunk groups that connect the Parties End Office(s) shall provide the Parties access only to the NXXs that
are served by that End Office(s).
5.5.9.1 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OE-LEC does not choose Access Tandem
interconnection at every AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem within a LATA,
OE-LEC must utilize AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s MTA Interconnection. To utilize
MTA, OE-LEC must establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at a minimum of one AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Access Tandem within each LATA as required.
5.5.10 AT&T-22STATE will open OE-LEC NPA-NXX codes, rated to or identified to reside in non-AT&T-22STATE
Exchange Areas, in AT&T-22STATE Tandems and End Offices using AT&T-22STATE’s standard code
opening timeframes.
5.6 Intercarrier Compensation for Out of Exchange Traffic:
5.6.1 The compensation arrangement for Out of Exchange Traffic exchanged between the Parties is described in
Section 6.0 below.
5.7 InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic:
5.7.1 AT&T-22STATE will exchange AT&T-22STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic that is covered by an
FCC approved or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver. AT&T-22STATE will exchange such traffic
using two-way direct final trunk groups (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI in the originating LATA, or (ii) via a
facility meet point arrangement at or near the Exchange Area Boundary (EAB), (iii) via a mutually agreed to
meet point facility within the AT&T-22STATE Exchange Area covered under such InterLATA waiver, or (iv)
via another mutually agreeable method. If the exchange where the traffic is terminating is not an AT&T-
22STATE exchange, AT&T-22STATE shall exchange such traffic using a two-way Direct Final (DF) trunk
group (i) via a facility to OE-LEC’s POI within the originating LATA, (ii) via a mutually agreed to facility meet
point arrangement at or near the EAB, or (iii) via another mutually agreeable method. AT&T-22STATE will
not provision or be responsible for facilities located outside of AT&T-22STATE Exchange Areas.
5.7.2 The Parties agree that the AT&T-22STATE InterLATA Section 251(b)(5) Traffic from each AT&T-22STATE
End Office will not overflow to an alternate route.
5.7.3 OE-LEC must provide AT&T-22STATE a separate Access Customer Terminal Location (ACTL) and Local
Routing Number (LRN) specific to each InterLATA local calling arrangement covered by an FCC approved
or court ordered InterLATA boundary waiver.
6.0 Intercarrier Compensation
6.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:
6.1.1 For all traffic originated on a Party’s network including, without limitation, Switched Access Traffic, such
Party shall provide CPN as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1600(c) and in accordance with Section 6.1.3 below.
CPN shall, at a minimum, include information in an industry recognized standard format, consistent with the
requirements of the NANP containing an NPA and seven digit (NXX-XXXX) telephone number. Each Party
to this Agreement will be responsible for passing on any CPN it receives from a Third Party for traffic
delivered to the other Party. In addition, each Party agrees that it shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete,
change, or incorrectly assign any CPN. If either Party identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of
local Exchange Services (including, but not limited to PRI, ISDN and/or Smart Trunks), or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, the Parties agree to cooperate
with one another to investigate and take corrective action.
6.1.2 If one Party is passing CPN but the other Party is not properly receiving information, the Parties will work
cooperatively to correct the problem.
6.1.3 For traffic which is originated by one Party to be terminated on the other Party’s network in AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE and AT&T CONNECTICUT, if the percentage of such calls passed with CPN is greater than ninety

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 21 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
percent (90%), all calls delivered by one Party to the other for termination without CPN will be billed as
either Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic or IntraLATA Toll Traffic in direct proportion to
the total MOUs (MOUs) of calls delivered by one Party to the other with CPN. If the percentage of calls
passed with CPN is less than ninety percent (90%), all calls delivered by one Party to the other without CPN
will be billed at Intrastate Switched Access rates.
6.1.4 For those CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE call usage based charges where actual charge
information is not determinable by AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate
vs. local) or origin of the CLEC to AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE traffic is unidentifiable, the Parties will
jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate charges to be billed
to the CLEC in accordance with Section 6.13.2 or a default factor of fifty percent (50%) will be applied.
6.1.5 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, each Party will report to the other Percent Interstate Usage
(PIU), Percent Local Usage (PLU) and Percent Local Facility (PLF) factors in order to determine the
appropriate charges to be billed to the originating Party in accordance with Section 6.13.3 below.
6.1.6 CLEC has the sole obligation to enter into compensation arrangements with all Third Parties with whom
CLEC exchanges traffic including without limitation anywhere CLEC originates traffic to or terminates traffic
from an End User being served by a Third Party who has purchased a local switching product from AT&T-
21STATE on a wholesale basis (non-resale) which is used by such Telecommunications carrier to provide
wireline local telephone Exchange Service (dial tone) to its End Users. In no event will AT&T-21STATE
have any liability to CLEC or any Third Party if CLEC fails to enter into such compensation arrangements.
In the event that traffic is exchanged with a Third Party with whom CLEC does not have a traffic
compensation agreement, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-21STATE against any and
all losses including without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party. The Third Party and CLEC will bill
their respective charges directly to each other. AT&T-21STATE will not be required to function as a billing
intermediary, (e.g., clearinghouse). AT&T-21STATE may provide information regarding such traffic to Third
Party carriers or entities as appropriate to resolve traffic compensation issues.
6.1.7 Notwithstanding the classification of traffic under this Attachment, either Party is free to define its own “local”
calling area(s) for purposes of its provision of Telecommunications services to its End Users.
6.1.8 For Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, IntraLATA Toll Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-
PSTN Traffic and Wholesale Local Switching Traffic in AT&T-12STATE, the Party whose End User
originates such traffic shall compensate the Party who terminates such traffic to its End User for the
transport and termination of such traffic at the applicable rate(s) provided in this Attachment and the Pricing
Schedule and/or the applicable switched access tariffs.
6.1.8.1 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on
a wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users, Wholesale Local Switching Traffic,
Optional EAS Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic originated by CLEC’s End Users are subject to
intercarrier compensation as addressed in Section 6.3.1.3 below.
6.1.9 To the extent that the Parties are not currently exchanging traffic in a given LATA or local calling area, the
Parties’ obligation to pay intercarrier compensation to each other shall commence on the date the Parties
agree that the Interconnection is complete (i.e., each Party has established its originating trunks as well as
all ancillary traffic trunking such as Operator Services, 911 or Mass Calling trunks) and is capable of fully
supporting originating and terminating End User traffic. In addition, the Parties agree that test traffic is not
subject to compensation pursuant to this Attachment.

Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged between the Parties at the rate set
forth in the Pricing Schedules.
6.3 Intercarrier Compensation for Wholesale Local Switching Traffic for AT&T-13STATE
6.3.1 Where CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE pursuant to the terms of a Section 271
Agreement (herein after referred to as “switching on a wholesale basis”), CLEC will deal directly with Third
Party carriers for purposes of reciprocal compensation for calls originated by or terminated to the End Users
served by such arrangements. AT&T-12STATE is required to provide CLEC with timely, complete and
correct information to enable CLEC to meet the requirements of this Section.
6.3.2 The following reciprocal compensation terms shall apply to all traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE
and CLEC when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T-12STATE on a wholesale basis:
6.3.2.1 For intra-switch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE and
CLEC, the Parties agree to impose no call termination charges pertaining to reciprocal
compensation on each other.
6.3.2.2 For interswitch Wholesale Local Switching Traffic exchanged between AT&T-12STATE and
CLEC where CLEC’s End User originates a call that is terminated to an AT&T-12STATE End
User, such traffic shall be paid for reciprocally at the rate applicable for 251(b)(5) and ISP-Bound
Traffic, set forth in the Pricing Schedules.
6.3.3 In AT&T CONNECTICUT, when CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a
wholesale basis to provide service to its End Users, AT&T CONNECTICUT will be solely responsible for
compensating the terminating Third Party carrier (where appropriate) for any traffic that originates from
CLEC’s End Users. When CLEC purchases local switching from AT&T CONNECTICUT on a wholesale
basis, CLEC can not seek intercarrier compensation from AT&T CONNECTICUT for any traffic that
originates from either an AT&T CONNECTICUT End User or a Third Party carrier’s End User.
6.4 Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) Interconnection (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE):
6.4.1 Compensation for MTA shall be at the applicable Tandem Switching and transport charges specified in
Pricing Schedule and shall be billed in addition to any call transport and termination charges.

6.5.2 FX services are retail service offerings purchased by FX End Users which allow such FX End Users to
obtain exchange service from a mandatory local calling area other than the mandatory local calling area
where the FX customer is physically located, but within the same LATA as the number that is assigned. FX
service enables particular End Users to avoid what might otherwise be toll calls between the FX End User’s
physical location and End Users in the foreign exchange. FX Telephone Numbers are those telephone
numbers with rating and routing points that are different from those of the geographic area in which the End
User is physically located. FX Telephone Numbers that deliver second dial tone with the ability for the
calling party to enter access codes and an additional recipient telephone number remain classified as FGA
calls and are subject to the originating and terminating carriers’ tariffed Switched Exchange Access rates
(also known as “Meet Point Billed” compensation). There are two types of FX service:
6.5.2.1 “Dedicated FX Traffic” shall mean those calls routed by means of a physical, dedicated circuit
delivering dial tone or otherwise serving an End User’s station from a serving Central Office (also
known as End Office) located outside of that station’s mandatory local calling area. Dedicated
FX Service permits the End User physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone
numbers resident in the serving Central (or End) Office in another “foreign” exchange, thereby
creating a local presence in that “foreign” exchange.
6.5.2.2 “Virtual Foreign Exchange (FX) Traffic” and “FX-type Traffic” shall refer to those calls delivered to
telephone numbers that are rated as local to the other telephone numbers in a given mandatory
local calling area, but where the recipient End User’s station assigned that telephone number is
physically located outside of that mandatory local calling area. Virtual FX Service also permits an
End User physically located in one exchange to be assigned telephone numbers resident in the
serving Central (or End) Office in another “foreign” exchange, thereby creating a local presence
in the “foreign” exchange. Virtual FX Service differs from Dedicated FX Service, however, in that
Virtual FX End Users continue to draw dial tone or are otherwise served from a Central (or End)
Office which may provide service across more than one Commission-prescribed mandatory local
calling area, whereas Dedicated FX Service End Users draw dial tone or are otherwise served
from a Central (or End) Office located outside their mandatory calling area.
6.5.2.3 FX Traffic is not Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and instead the transport and termination compensation
for FX Traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement in AT&T-21STATE.
6.5.2.3.1 To the extent that ISP-Bound Traffic is provisioned via an FX-type arrangement,
such traffic is subject to a Bill and Keep arrangement. “Bill and Keep” refers to an
arrangement in which neither of two interconnecting parties charges the other for
terminating FX traffic that originates on the other party’s network.
6.5.2.4 Pursuant to the Connecticut Commission decision in Docket No. 01-01-29RE01, the originating
Party will bill the terminating Party the appropriate originating access charges for all traffic except
ISP-Bound Traffic that is terminated to a number that is provisioned as a Virtual FX, Dedicated
FX or FX-type service as defined in Section 6.5.2 above in AT&T CONNECTICUT. In such
circumstances, for ISP-Bound Traffic the appropriate compensation mechanism is bill and keep.
6.5.2.5 Segregating and Tracking FX Traffic:
6.5.2.5.1 For AT&T-21STATE, the terminating carrier is responsible for separately identifying
IntraLATA Virtual FX, Dedicated FX and FX-type traffic from other types of
Intercarrier traffic for compensation purposes. The terminating carrier will be
responsible for providing the originating carrier with an FX usage summary which
includes a ten (10) digit telephone number level detail of the MOUs terminated to FX
Telephone Numbers on its network each month (or in each applicable billing period,
if not billed monthly), or by any means mutually agreed by the Parties.
6.5.2.5.2 Terminating carrier will not assess compensation charges to the Voice FX MOU and
ISP FX MOU in AT&T-21STATE.

Page 25 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
6.5.2.5.3 AT&T CONNECTICUT, FX traffic must be identified as voice FX and ISP FX. AT&T
CONNECTICUT will work with CLEC in reviewing its data to determine the volume of
IntraLATA FX traffic being exchanged for an agreed-upon period of time. Once the
data review is completed, the Parties will estimate the percentage of MOUs that is
attributable to FX traffic and assign percentage factors. For AT&T CONNECTICUT
ISP FX percentage will be assigned (“PIFX”) and voice FX percentage will be
assigned (“PVFX”). The PIFX and PVFX (“FX factor”) will be used in lieu of
providing the actual MOUs data. This plan will be applied on an individual CLEC
basis.
6.5.2.5.3.1 The FX factor will be applied to the measured local usage MOUs and
result in the following billing adjustments:
6.5.2.5.3.1.1 Terminating carrier will subtract both the voice FX
MOU and ISP FX MOU from the measured local
MOU prior to assessing terminating compensation
charges.
6.5.2.5.3.1.2 Originating carrier will apply the appropriate
originating access charges only to the Voice FX
MOU in AT&T CONNECTICUT.
6.5.2.5.4 In AT&T-22STATE either Party may request an audit of the FX Usage Summary or
the FX Factor on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Day’s written Notice and any
audit shall be accomplished during normal business hours at the office of the Party
being audited. Such audit must be performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid
for by the Party requesting the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the
Parties shall use one of the following independent auditors:
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
(Big-4 Auditors). Selection of the Big-4 Auditor shall be made by the Party
requesting the audit and the selected Big-4 Auditor must be independent as
determined by current accounting and auditing standards promulgated by the
appropriate accounting governing body. Such audits shall be requested within six
(6) months of having received the FX Usage Summary or the FX Factor and
associated usage from the other Party and may not be requested more than twice
per year, once per calendar year, unless the audit finds there has been a five
percent (5%) or higher net error or variance in calculations, in which case a
subsequent audit is required. Based upon the audit, previous compensation, billing
and/or settlements will be adjusted for the past six (6) months.
6.5.2.5.4.1 If the FX factor is adjusted based upon the audit results, the adjusted
FX factor will apply for the six (6) month period following the
completion of the audit. If, as a result of the audit, either Party has
overstated the FX factor or underreported the FX Usage by five
percent (5%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for
the cost of the audit and will pay for the cost of a subsequent audit
which is to happen within nine (9) months of the initial audit.
6.5.3 Private Line Services include private line-like and special access services and are not subject to intercarrier
compensation. Private Line Services are defined as a point-to-point connection that provides a dedicated
circuit of pre-subscribed bandwidth between two (2) or more points.
6.5.4 The Parties recognize and agree that ISP and Internet traffic (excluding ISP-Bound Traffic as defined in
Section 6.2 above) could also be exchanged outside of the applicable local calling scope, or routed in ways
that could make the rates and rate structure in Section 6.2 above not apply, including but not limited to ISP
calls that meet the definitions of:

6.5.4.1 FX Traffic
6.5.4.2 Optional EAS Traffic
6.5.4.3 IntraLATA Toll Traffic
6.5.4.4 800, 888, 877, (“8YY”) Traffic
6.5.4.5 FGA Traffic
6.5.4.6 MCA Traffic
6.5.5 The Parties agree that, for the purposes of this Attachment, either Party’s End Users remain free to place
ISP calls under any of the above classifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the
extent such ISP calls are placed, the Parties agree that the compensation mechanisms set forth in Section
6.2 above do not apply. The applicable rates, terms and conditions for: (a) FX Traffic are set forth in
Section 6.5.2 above; (b), Optional EAS Traffic are set forth in Section 6.6 below; (c) 8YY Traffic are set forth
in Section 6.9 below; (d) FGA Traffic are set forth in Section 6.5.2 above; (e) IntraLATA Toll Traffic are set
forth in Section 6.12 below; and/or (f) MCA Traffic are set forth in Section 6.7 below.
6.6 Optional Calling Area Traffic - AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS:
6.6.1 Compensation for Optional Calling Area (OCA) Traffic, (also known as Optional Extended Area Service and
Optional EAS) is for the termination of intercompany traffic to and from the Commission approved one-way
or two-way optional exchanges(s) and the associated metropolitan area except mandatory extended traffic
as addressed in Section 6.2 above. The transport and termination rate applies when AT&T ARKANSAS,
AT&T KANSAS or AT&T TEXAS transports traffic and terminates it at its own switch.
6.6.2 In the context of this Attachment, Optional Calling Areas (OCAs) exist only in the states of Arkansas,
Kansas and Texas and are outlined in the applicable state Local Exchange tariffs. This rate is independent
of any retail service arrangement established by either Party. CLEC and AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
KANSAS and AT&T TEXAS are not precluded from establishing their own local calling areas or prices for
purposes of retail telephone service; however the terminating rates to be used for any such offering will still
be administered as described in this Attachment.
6.6.3 The state specific OCA Transport and Termination rates are identified in the Pricing Schedule.
6.7 MCA Traffic - AT&T MISSOURI:
6.7.1 For compensation purposes in the state of Missouri, Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic shall be
further defined as MCA Traffic and Non-MCA Traffic. MCA Traffic is traffic originated by a party providing a
local calling scope plan pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Orders in Case No. TO-92-306
and Case No. TO-99-483 (MCA Orders) and the call is Section 251(b)(5) Traffic based on the calling scope
of the originating party pursuant to the MCA Orders. Non-MCA Traffic is all Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and
ISP-Bound Traffic that is not defined as MCA Traffic.
6.7.1.1 Either party providing Metropolitan Calling Area (MCA) service shall offer the full calling scope
prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306, without regard to the identity of the called Party’s local
service provider. The Parties may offer additional toll-free outbound calling or other services in
conjunction with MCA service, but in any such offering the Party shall not identify any calling
scope other than that prescribed in Case No. TO-92-306 as “MCA” service.
6.7.1.2 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, MCA Traffic
shall be exchanged on a Bill and Keep intercompany compensation basis meaning that the Party
originating a call defined as MCA Traffic shall not compensate the terminating Party for
terminating the call.
6.7.2 The Parties agree to use the LERG to provision the appropriate MCA NXXs in their networks. The LERG
should be updated at least forty-five (45) calendar days in advance of opening a new code to allow the other
Party the ability to make the necessary network modifications. If the Commission orders the Parties to use
an alternative other than the LERG, the Parties will comply with the Commission’s final order.

6.7.3 If CLEC provides service via Resale or in conjunction with ported numbers in the MCA, the appropriate MCA
NXXs will be updated by AT&T MISSOURI.
6.8 Primary Toll Carrier Arrangements:
6.8.1 A Primary Toll Carrier (PTC) is a company that provides IntraLATA Toll Traffic Service for its own End User
customers and potentially for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers. In this ILEC arrangement, the PTC
would receive the ILEC End User IntraLATA toll traffic revenues and pay the ILEC for originating these toll
calls. The PTC would also pay the terminating switched access charges on behalf of the ILEC. In AT&T
GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE wherein Primary Toll Carrier arrangements are mandated and AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T
KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE
is functioning as the PTC for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, the following provisions apply to the
IntraLATA toll traffic which is subject to the PTC arrangement:
6.8.1.1 AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated
from that Third Party ILEC and terminated to CLEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state
Commission. Where AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA is functioning as the PTC for
Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, AT&T NEVADA and/or AT&T OKLAHOMA shall pay
CLEC on behalf of the originating Third Party ILEC for the termination of such IntraLATA toll
traffic at the terminating switched access rates as set forth in CLEC’s intrastate access service
tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in the AT&T-
22STATE intrastate access service tariff in the respective state.
6.8.1.2 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE
shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated from that Third Party ILEC and terminated
to CLEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC
arrangement mandated by the respective state Commission. Where AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T
KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE is functioning as the PTC
for a Third Party ILEC’s End User customers, the following provisions apply to the minutes of use
terminating to CLEC. AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE and CLEC will work cooperatively to develop a percentage of the amount of
state specific PTC ILEC originated intraLATA toll minutes of use that are within the state specific
total ILEC originated minutes of use reflected in the monthly EMI 11-01-01 Records provided to
CLEC by AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T
TENNESSEE. CLEC will apply this state specific percentage against the state specific total ILEC
originated EMI 11-01-01 minutes of use each month to determine the amount of PTC intraLATA
toll minutes of use for which AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA
and/or AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC. Such percentage will be updated no more
than twice each year. AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or
AT&T TENNESSEE will compensate CLEC for this PTC traffic as it would for AT&T-22STATE
originated traffic as set forth in CLEC’s Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
6.8.1.3 AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH
CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE shall deliver such IntraLATA toll traffic that originated
from CLEC and terminated to the Third Party ILEC as the terminating carrier in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such PTC arrangement mandated by the respective state
Commission. CLEC shall pay AT&T GEORGIA, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T NEVADA, AT&T
OKLAHOMA, AT&T SOUTH CAROLINA and/or AT&T TENNESSEE for the use of its facilities
at the rates set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s intrastate access service tariff in the respective state.
CLEC shall pay the ILEC directly for the termination of such traffic originated from CLEC.
6.9 IntraLATA 800 Traffic:
6.9.1 The Parties shall provide to each other IntraLATA 800 Access Detail Usage Data for Customer billing and
IntraLATA 800 Copy Detail Usage Data for access billing in Exchange Message Interface (EMI) format. On

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE
Page 28 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
a monthly basis, at a minimum, the Parties agree to provide this data to each other at no charge. In the
event of errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in data received from either Party, the liability of the Party
providing such data shall be limited to the provision of corrected data only. If the originating Party does not
send an End User billable Record to the terminating Party, the originating Party will not bill the terminating
Party any interconnection charges for this traffic.
6.9.2 IntraLATA 800 Traffic calls are billed to and paid for by the called or terminating Party, regardless of which
Party performs the 800 query. For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, each Party shall pay the other
the appropriate switched access charges set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate
or interstate switched access tariffs. CLEC will pay AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE the database
query charge as set forth in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access
services Tariff as filed and in effect with the FCC or appropriate Commission as applicable. Where
technically feasible, each Party will provide to the other Party the appropriate Records, in accordance with
industry standards, necessary for billing intraLATA 8YY customers. The Records provided will be in a
standard EMI format. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE provision of 8YY Toll Free Dialing (TFD) to
CLEC requires interconnection from CLEC to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s 8YY Signal
Channel Point (SCP). Such interconnections shall be established pursuant to AT&T-22STATE’s Common
Channel Signaling Interconnection Guidelines and Telcordia’s CCS Network Interface Specification
document, TR-TSV-000905. CLEC shall establish SS7 interconnection at the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE Local Signal Transfer Points serving the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE 8YY
SCPs that CLEC desires to query. The terms and conditions for 8YY TFD are set out in AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff.
6.10 Meet-Point Billing (MPB) and IXC Switched Access Traffic Compensation:
6.10.1 Intercarrier compensation for Switched Access Traffic shall be on a MPB basis as described below.
6.10.2 The Parties will establish MPB arrangements in order to jointly provide Switched Access Services via the
respective carrier’s Tandem Office Switch in accordance with the MPB guidelines contained in the OBF’s
Multiple Exchange Carriers Ordering and Design (MECOD) and Multiple Exchange Carrier Access Billing
(MECAB) documents, as amended from time to time.
6.10.3 Billing for the Switched Exchange Access Services jointly provided by the Parties via MPB arrangements
shall be according to the Multiple Bill/Single Tariff method. As described in the MECAB document, each
Party will render a bill in accordance with its own tariff for that portion of the service it provides. Each Party
will bill its own network access service rates. The Residual Interconnection Charge (RIC), if any, will be
billed by the Party providing the End Office function.
6.10.4 The Parties will maintain provisions in their respective federal and state access tariffs, or provisions within
the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any successor tariff, sufficient to reflect
this MPB arrangement, including MPB percentages.
6.10.5 As detailed in the MECAB document, the Parties will exchange all information necessary to accurately,
reliably and promptly bill third parties for Switched Access Services traffic jointly handled by the Parties via
the MPB arrangement, when the Parties do not have all detailed Recordings for billing.
6.10.5.1 The Parties agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will bill IXCs for originating and
terminating access charges from AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Recordings when
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has direct connections with IXCs via AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s access tandem. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will
pass EMI Records to CLEC when AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is the Official
Recording Company. The Parties also agree that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and
CLEC will exchange EMI records when each are acting as the Official Recording Company and
the CLEC is the access tandem company with direct connections with IXCs.
6.10.5.2 The Parties also agree that AT&T-13STATE and CLEC will exchange EMI Records when each is
acting as the Official Recording Company. As described in the MECAB document, the Official
Recording Company for Tandem routed traffic is: (1) the End Office company for originating

Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
traffic, (2) the Tandem company for terminating traffic and (3) the SSP company for originating
800 traffic.
6.10.6 Information shall be passed or exchanged in a mutually acceptable electronic file transfer protocol. Where
the EMI Records cannot be transferred due to a transmission failure, Records can be provided via a
mutually acceptable medium. The provision of Access Usage Records (AURs) to accommodate MPB will
be on a reciprocal, no charge basis. Each Party agrees to provide the other Party with AURs based upon
mutually agreed upon intervals.
6.10.7 MPB shall also apply to all jointly provided Switched Access MOU traffic bearing the 900, or toll free NPAs
(e.g., 800, 877, 866, 888 NPAs, or any other non-geographic NPAs).
6.10.7.1 For AT&T-13STATE, the Party that performs the SSP function (launches the query to the 800
database) will bill the 800 Service Provider for this function.
6.10.7.2 For AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, CLEC will pay the database query charge set forth
in the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE intrastate or interstate access services Tariff.
6.10.8 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC agree to provide the other Party with notification of any discovered errors in the
record exchange process within ten (10) Business Days of the discovery.
6.10.9 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60)
calendar days of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable estimate of
the lost data, based upon no less than three (3) and no more than twelve (12) consecutive months of prior
usage data.
6.11 Compensation for Origination and Termination of InterLATA Traffic:
6.11.1 Where a CLEC originates or terminates its own End User InterLATA Traffic not subject to MPB, the CLEC
must purchase feature group access service from AT&T-22STATE’s state or federal access tariffs,
whichever is applicable, to carry such InterLATA Traffic.
6.12 IntraLATA Toll Traffic Compensation:
6.12.1 For intrastate IntraLATA Message Telephone Service (MTS) toll traffic, compensation for termination of
such traffic will be at terminating access rates. For intrastate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for
termination of such traffic will be at originating access rates, including the Carrier Common Line (CCL)
charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set forth in each Party’s intrastate access
service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the compensation contained in AT&T-22STATE’s
tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.12.2 For interstate IntraLATA MTS toll traffic, compensation for termination of such traffic will be at terminating
access rates. For interstate IntraLATA 800 Service, compensation for termination of such traffic will be
originating access rates, including the CCL charge where applicable. The appropriate access rates are set
forth in each Party’s interstate access service tariff, but such compensation shall not exceed the
compensation contained in the AT&T-22STATE’s tariff in whose exchange area the End User is located.
6.13 Billing Arrangements for Termination of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic, Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic,
Optional EAS Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic:
6.13.1 In AT&T-22STATE, each Party, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, will calculate terminating
Interconnection MOUs based on standard switch Recordings made within terminating carrier’s network for
Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic, Optional EAS Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic, IntraLATA Toll Traffic and in AT&T-
13STATE, Wholesale Local Switching Traffic. These Recordings are the basis for each Party to generate
bills to the other Party.
6.13.1.1 Where CLEC is using terminating Recordings to bill intercarrier compensation, AT&T-12STATE
will provide the terminating Records where available by means of the Daily Usage File (DUF) to
identify traffic that originates from an End User being served by a Third Party telecommunications
carrier using an AT&T-12STATE non-resale offering whereby AT&T-12STATE provides the End

Attachment 02 - All Traffic - FCC ICC - Network Interconnection/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
Office switching on a wholesale basis. Such Records will contain the Operating Company
Number (OCN) of the responsible LEC that originated the calls which CLEC may use to bill such
originating carrier for MOUs terminated on CLEC’s network.
6.13.2 For those usage based charges where actual charge information is not determinable by AT&T WEST
REGION 2-STATE because the jurisdiction (i.e., intrastate vs. local) or origin of the traffic is unidentifiable,
the Parties will jointly develop a Percent Local Usage (PLU) factor in order to determine the appropriate
charges. PLU is calculated by dividing the sum of Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic
MOU and ISP-Bound Traffic MOU delivered to a Party for termination by the total MOU delivered to a Party
for termination.
6.13.2.1 CLEC and AT&T WEST REGION 2-STATE agree to exchange such reports and/or data as
provided in this Attachment to facilitate the proper billing of traffic. Either Party may request an
audit of such usage reports on no fewer than thirty (30) Business Days written Notice and any
audit shall be accomplished during normal business hours at the office of the Party being audited.
Such audit must be performed by a mutually agreed-to auditor paid for by the Party requesting
the audit. If mutual agreement cannot be reached within one (1) month of the date of the written
request for an audit, the Parties shall use one (1) of the following independent auditors:
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Big-4 Auditors).
Selection of the Big-4 Auditor shall be made by the Party requesting the audit and the selected
Big-4 Auditor must be independent as determined by current accounting and auditing standards
promulgated by the appropriate accounting governing body. Such audit shall be requested within
six (6) months of having received the usage reports from the other Party and may not be
requested more than twice per year, once per calendar year for each call detail type unless the
audit finds there has been a five percent (5%) or higher net error or variance in calculations.
Based upon the audit, previous compensation, billing and/or settlements will be adjusted for the
past six (6) months. If, as a result of the audit, either Party has overstated the PLU or
underreported the call detail usage by five percent (5%) or more, that Party shall reimburse the
auditing Party for the cost of the audit.
6.13.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Jurisdictional Reporting Process:
6.13.3.1 Each Party shall report to the other the projected PIU factors, including but not limited to PIU
associated with facilities (PIUE) and Terminating PIU (TPIU) factors. The application of the PIU
will determine the respective interstate traffic percentages to be billed at AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE’s FCC No. 1 Tariff rates. All jurisdictional report requirements, rules and
regulations for IXCs specified in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s interstate and/or
intrastate access services tariff(s) will apply to CLEC. After interstate and intrastate traffic
percentages have been determined by use of PIU procedures, the PLU and PLF factors will be
used for application and billing of local traffic and facilities. The intrastate toll traffic shall be billed
at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s intrastate access services tariff rates. Each Party
shall update its PIUs on the first of January, April, July and October of each year and shall send it
to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such
month to be effective the first bill period the following month, respectively, for all services showing
the percentages of use for the past three (3) months ending the last day of December, March,
June and September. Additional requirements associated with PIU calculations and reporting
shall be as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting
Guide.
6.13.3.2 Each Party shall report to the other a PLU factor. The application of the PLU will determine the
amount of local or ISP-Bound minutes to be billed to the other Party. Each Party shall update its
PLU on the first of January, April, July and October of each year and shall send it to the other
Party to be received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such month to be
effective the first bill period the following month, respectively, based on local and ISP-Bound
usage for the past three (3) months ending the last day of December, March, June and

September, respectively. Requirements associated with PLU calculation and reporting shall be
as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.13.3.3 Each Party shall report to the other a PLF factor. The application of the PLF will determine the
portion of switched dedicated transport to be billed per the local jurisdiction rates. The PLF shall
be applied to multiplexing, local channel and interoffice channel switched dedicated transport
utilized in the provision of Local Interconnection Trunks. Each Party shall update its PLF on the
first of January, April, July and October of the year and shall send it to the other Party to be
received no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the first of each such month to be effective
the first bill period the following month, respectively. Requirements associated with PLF
calculation and reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s
Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
6.13.3.4 Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 6.13.3.1 above, Section 6.13.3.2 above and Section
6.13.3.3 above where AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has message Recording
technology that identifies the jurisdiction of traffic terminated to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE, such information shall, at AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s option, be utilized to
determine the appropriate jurisdictional reporting factors (i.e., PLU, PIU and/or PLF), in lieu of
those provided by CLEC. In the event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE opts to utilize
its own data to determine jurisdictional reporting factors, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE
shall notify CLEC at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter
in which AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will begin to utilize its own data.
6.13.3.5 On thirty (30) calendar days written Notice, CLEC must provide AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE the ability and opportunity to conduct an annual audit to ensure the proper billing of
traffic. CLEC shall retain Records of call detail for a minimum of nine (9) months from which the
PLU, PLF and/or PIU can be ascertained. The audit shall be conducted during normal business
hours at an office designated by CLEC. Audit requests shall not be submitted more frequently
than one (1) time per calendar year. Audits shall be performed by an independent auditor
chosen by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. The audited factor (PLF, PLU and/or PIU)
shall be adjusted based upon the audit results and shall apply to the usage for the audited period
through the time period when the audit is completed, to the usage for the quarter prior to the audit
period and to the usage for the two (2) quarters following the completion of the audit. If, as a
result of an audit, CLEC is found to have overstated the PLF, PLU and/or PIU by five percentage
points (5%) or more, CLEC shall reimburse AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE for the cost
of the audit.
6.13.4 In states in which AT&T-22STATE has offered to exchange Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic
pursuant to the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan set forth in the FCC ISP Compensation
Order, ISP-Bound Traffic will be calculated using the 3:1 Presumption as set forth in Section 6.2.10 above of
this Attachment.
6.13.5 The measurement of MOUs over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups shall be in actual conversation
seconds. The total conversation seconds over each individual Local Interconnection Trunk Group will be
totaled for the entire monthly bill and then rounded to the next whole minute.
6.13.6 All ISP-Bound Traffic for a given usage month shall be due and owing at the same time as payments for
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic under this Attachment. The Parties agree that all
terms and conditions regarding disputed MOUs, nonpayment, partial payment, late payment, interest on
outstanding balances, or other billing and payment terms shall apply to ISP-Bound Traffic the same as for
Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and Non-toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic under this Attachment.
6.13.7 For billing disputes arising from Intercarrier Compensation charges, the Party challenging the disputed
amounts (the “Non-Paying Party”) may withhold payment for the amounts in dispute (the “Disputed
Amounts”) from the Party rendering the bill (the “Billing Party”) only for so long as the dispute remains
pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and Conditions. Late payment
charges and interest will continue to accrue on the Disputed Amounts while the dispute remains pending.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
The Non-Paying Party need not pay late payment charges or interest on the Disputed Amounts for so long
as the dispute remains pending pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of the General Terms and
Conditions. Upon resolution of the dispute pertaining to the Disputed Amounts in accordance with the
dispute resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions: (1) the Non-Paying Party will remit the
appropriate Disputed Amounts to the Billing Party, together with all related interest and late payment
charges, to the Billing Party within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute, if (and to the
extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party; and/or (2) the Billing Party will render all
appropriate credits and adjustments to the Non-Paying Party for the Disputed Amounts, together with all
appropriate interest and late payment charges, within ten (10) business days of the resolution of the dispute,
if (and to the extent) the dispute is resolved in favor of the Non-Paying Party.
6.13.8 In the event of a loss of data, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the lost data within sixty (60)
calendar days of notification and if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable estimate of
the lost data, based upon no less than three (3) and no more than twelve (12) consecutive months of prior
usage data.
6.14 Switched Access Traffic:
6.14.1 For purposes of this Agreement only, Switched Access Traffic shall mean all traffic that originates from an
End User physically located in one (1) local exchange and delivered for termination to an End User
physically located in a different local exchange (excluding traffic from exchanges sharing a common
mandatory local calling area as defined in AT&T-22STATE’s local exchange tariffs on file with the
applicable state commission) including, without limitation, any traffic that terminates over a Party’s circuit
switch, including traffic from a service that (i) originates over a circuit switch and uses Internet Protocol (IP)
transport technology (regardless of whether only one provider uses IP transport or multiple providers are
involved in providing IP transport) and/or (ii) originates from the End User’s premises in IP format and is
transmitted to the switch of a provider of voice communication applications or services when such switch
utilizes IP technology. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Switched Access
Traffic shall be delivered to the terminating Party over feature group access trunks per the terminating
Party’s access tariff(s) and shall be subject to applicable intrastate and interstate switched access charges
not to exceed AT&T’s access tariff rates; provided, however, the following categories of Switched Access
Traffic are not subject to the above stated requirement relating to routing over feature group access trunks:
6.14.1.1 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from a CLEC End User that obtains local dial tone
from CLEC where CLEC is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic provider and the IntraLATA toll
provider;
6.14.1.2 IntraLATA Toll Traffic or Optional EAS Traffic from an AT&T-22STATE End User that obtains
local dial tone from AT&T-22STATE where AT&T-22STATE is both the Section 251(b)(5) Traffic/
provider and the IntraLATA toll provider;
6.14.1.3 Switched Access Traffic delivered to AT&T-22STATE from an IXC where the terminating number
is ported to another CLEC and the IXC fails to perform the LNP query; and/or
6.14.1.4 Switched Access Traffic delivered to either Party from a Third Party CLEC over Local
Interconnection Trunk Groups destined to the other Party.
6.15 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party reserves it rights, remedies and arguments
relating to the application of switched access charges for traffic exchanged by the Parties prior to the Effective Date
of this Agreement and described in the FCC’s Order issued in the Petition for Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-
to-Phone IP Telephony Services Exempt from Access Charges, WC Docket No. 01-361 (Released April 21, 2004).
6.15.1 In the limited circumstances in which a Third Party CLEC delivers Switched Access Traffic as described in
Section 6.15.1.4 above to either Party over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups, such Party may deliver
such Switched Access Traffic to the terminating Party over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If it is
determined that such traffic has been delivered over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups and unless the
traffic was delivered over Local Interconnection Trunk Groups pursuant to an agreement filed with, and
approved by, the Commission, the terminating Party may object to the delivery of such traffic by providing

written notice to the delivering Party pursuant to the Notice provisions set forth in the General Terms and
Conditions and request removal of such traffic. The Parties will work cooperatively to identify the traffic with
the goal of removing such traffic from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups. If the delivering Party has
not removed or is unable to remove such Switched Access Traffic as described in Section 6.15.1.4 above
from the Local Interconnection Trunk Groups within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of Notice from the
other Party, the Parties agree to jointly file a complaint or any other appropriate action with the applicable
Commission to seek any necessary permission to remove the traffic from such interconnection trunks up to
and including the right to block such traffic and to obtain compensation, if appropriate, from the Third Party
CLEC delivering such traffic to the extent it is not blocked.
7.0 Recording
7.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:
7.1.1 AT&T-22STATE will record all IXC transported messages for CLEC carried over all Feature Group
Switched Access Services that are available to AT&T-22STATE provided Recording equipment or

7.1.7 AT&T-22STATE will provide message detail to CLEC in data files, (a File Transfer Protocol or
Connect:Direct “NDM”), or any other mutually agreed upon process to receive and deliver messages using
software and hardware acceptable to both Parties. In order for the CLEC to receive End User billable
Records, the CLEC may be required to obtain CMDS Hosting service from AT&T or another CMDS Hosting
service provider.
7.1.8 CLEC will identify separately the location where the Data Transmissions should be sent (as applicable) and
the number of times each month the information should be provided. AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to
limit the frequency of transmission to existing AT&T-22STATE processing and work schedules, holidays,
etc.
7.2 AT&T-22STATE will determine the number of data files required to provide the AUR detail to CLEC.
7.2.1 Recorded Billable Message detail and/or AUR detail previously provided CLEC and lost or destroyed
through no fault of AT&T-22STATE will not be recovered and made available to CLEC except on an
individual case basis at a cost determined by AT&T-22STATE.
7.2.2 When AT&T-22STATE receives rated Billable Messages from an IXC or another LEC that are to be billed
by CLEC, AT&T-22STATE may forward those messages to CLEC.
7.2.3 AT&T-22STATE will record the applicable detail necessary to generate AURs and forward them to CLEC
for its use in billing access to the IXC.
7.2.4 When CLEC is the Recording Company, the CLEC agrees to provide its recorded Billable Messages detail

Page 34 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q12 - CLEC ICA - 12/14/12
7.3.1 AT&T-22STATE as the Recording Company, agrees to provide recording, Assembly and Editing, Message
Processing and Provision of Message Detail for AURs ordered/required by the CLEC in accordance with
this Section on a reciprocal, no-charge basis. CLEC, as the Recording Company, agrees to provide any
and all AURs required by AT&T-22STATE on a reciprocal, no-charge basis. The Parties agree that this
mutual exchange of Records at no charge to either Party shall otherwise be conducted according to the
guidelines and specifications contained in the MECAB document.
7.4 Limitation of Liability:
7.4.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Limitation of Liability will be governed by the General Terms and
Conditions of this Agreement.
7.4.2 Except as otherwise provided herein, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any special, indirect, or
consequential damage of any kind whatsoever. A Party shall not be liable for its inability to meet the terms
of this Agreement where such inability is caused by failure of the first Party to comply with the obligations
stated herein. Each Party is obliged to use its best efforts to mitigate damages.
7.4.3 When either Party is notified that, due to error or omission, incomplete data has been provided to the non-
Recording Company, each Party will make reasonable efforts to locate and/or recover the data and provide
it to the non-Recording Company at no additional charge. Such requests to recover the data must be made
within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the details initially were made available to the non-Recording
Company. If written notification is not received within sixty (60) calendar days, the Recording Company
shall have no further obligation to recover the data and shall have no further liability to the non-Recording
Company.
7.4.4 If, despite timely notification by the non-Recording Company, message detail is lost and unrecoverable as a
direct result of the Recording Company having lost or damaged tapes or incurred system outages while
performing recording, Assembly and Editing, rating, Message Processing and/or transmission of message
detail, both Parties will estimate the volume of lost messages and associated revenue based on information
available to it concerning the average revenue per minute for the average interstate and/or intrastate call. In
such events, the Recording Company’s liability shall be limited to the granting of a credit adjusting amounts
otherwise due from it equal to the estimated net lost revenue associated with the lost message detail.
7.4.5 Each Party will not be liable for any costs incurred by the other Party when transmitting data files via data
lines and a transmission failure results in the non-receipt of data.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment 03 - Structure Access (here-on referred to as “Appendix”) sets forth the terms and conditions for
Right(s) of Way (ROW), Conduits and Poles provided by AT&T-22STATE and CLEC.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Anchor” means a device, structure, or assembly which stabilizes a Pole and holds it in place. An Anchor assembly
may consist of a rod and fixed object or plate, typically embedded in the ground, which is attached to a guy strand or
guy wire, which, in turn, is attached to the Pole. The term Anchor does not include the guy strand which connects the
Anchor to the Pole and includes only those Anchors which are owned by AT&T-22STATE, as distinguished from
Anchors which are owned and controlled by other persons or entities.
2.2 “Anchor/Guy Strand” means supporting wires, typically stranded together, or other devices attached to a Pole and
connecting that Pole to an Anchor or to another Pole for the purpose of increasing Pole stability. The term
Anchor/Guy Strand includes, but is not limited to, strands sometimes referred to as Anchor strands, down guys, guy
strands, and Pole-to-Pole guys.
2.3 “Application” means the process of requesting information related to records, Pole and/or Conduit availability, or
make-ready requirements for AT&T-22STATE-owned or controlled Facilities. Each Application is limited in size to a
maximum of 1) 100 consecutive Poles or 2) 10 consecutive Manhole sections or 5000 feet, whichever is greater. The
Application includes (but is not limited to) request for records, records investigation and/or a field investigation, and
Make-Ready Work.
2.4 “Assigned” when used with respect to Conduit or Duct space or Poles, means any space in such Conduit or Duct or
on such Pole that is occupied by a Telecommunications Service provider or a municipal or other governmental
authority. To ensure the judicious use of Poles and Conduits, space Assigned to a Telecommunications Service
provider must be physically occupied by the service provider, be it AT&T-22STATE or a new entrant, within twelve
(12) months of the space being Assigned.
2.5 “Attaching Party” means any Party wishing to make a physical Facility Attachment on or in any AT&T structure.
2.6 “Attachment” as used herein means the physical connection to AT&T-22STATE‘s ROW and all associated Structure

shall be determined in accordance with such Licenses and procedures established in this Appendix.
3.2.3 CLEC agrees that its attachment of Facilities to AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Poles, occupancy of
AT&T-22STATE’s owned or controlled Conduits, Ducts or ROW shall take place pursuant to the licensing
procedures set forth herein, and AT&T-22STATE agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
issuance of such Licenses.
3.2.4 CLEC may not sublease or otherwise authorize any Third Party to use any part of the AT&T-22STATE
Facilities licensed to CLEC under this Appendix, except that CLEC may lease its own Facilities to Third
Parties, or allow Affiliates to over lash cables to CLEC cables. Notwithstanding the above, upon Notice to
AT&T-22STATE, CLEC may permit Third Parties who have an Agreement with AT&T-22STATE to over
lash to existing CLEC attachments in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Third Party’s
Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
3.2.5 Attaching Party warrants that any overlashing the Attaching Party conducts or permits (via a third party or
contractor) shall meet the following requirements: (1) the overlashing complies with the NESC and any other
industry standards; (2) the Attaching Party has computed the pole loading with the additional overlashed
facility, and the pole will not be overloaded with the addition of the overlashed facility; (3) the Attaching Party
has determined that no make ready is necessary to accommodate the overlashed facility, or will insure that
any make-ready necessary will be conducted before the overlashing occurs. Attaching Party agrees to
indemnify AT&T-22STATE should any of the warranties be breached.
3.3 Licenses:
3.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE shall issue to CLEC one or
more Licenses per state authorizing CLEC to place or attach Facilities in or to specified Poles, Conduits,
Ducts or ROW owned or controlled by AT&T-22STATE located within the state on a “first-come, first-
served” basis. AT&T-22STATE may deny a License Application if AT&T-22STATE determines that the
Pole, Conduit or Duct space specifically requested by CLEC is necessary to meet AT&T-22STATE’s
present needs, or is Licensed by AT&T-22STATE to another CLEC, or is otherwise unavailable based on
engineering concerns. AT&T-22STATE shall provide written Notice to CLEC within a reasonable time
specifying in detail the reasons for denying CLEC’s request. AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to

AT&T-22STATE the right to provide such rights to others.
3.4.3 Where AT&T-22STATE notifies CLEC that AT&T-22STATE’s Agreement with a Third Party does not
expressly or impliedly grant AT&T-22STATE the ability to provide such access and use rights to others,
upon CLEC’s request, AT&T-22STATE will use its best efforts to obtain the owner’s consent and to
otherwise secure such rights for CLEC. CLEC agrees to reimburse AT&T-22STATE for the reasonable and
demonstrable Costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE in obtaining such rights for CLEC.
3.4.4 In cases where a Third Party Agreement does not grant AT&T-22STATE the right to provide access and
use rights to others as contemplated in Section 3.4.2 above and AT&T-22STATE, despite its best efforts, is
unable to secure such access and use rights for CLEC in accordance with Section 3.4.3 above, or, in the
case where CLEC elects not to invoke its rights under Section 3.4.2 above or Section 3.4.3 above, CLEC
shall be responsible for obtaining such permission to access and use such ROW. AT&T-22STATE shall
cooperate with CLEC in obtaining such permission and shall not prevent or delay any Third Party

and/or field survey to determine availability, and/or (3) requesting a Make-Ready Work estimate. Any Joint
Use Pole(s) included in such a request shall be included in the records/field survey and Make-Ready Work
estimate. Before the Application and Conduit Occupancy License or Application and Pole Attachment
License form is approved for attachment, Make-Ready Work must be complete or a records or field survey
conducted by AT&T-22STATE has determined that Make-Ready Work is not required. CLEC shall submit
with CLEC’s License Application a proposed or estimated construction schedule as set forth below in
Section 11.0 below.
8.2 AT&T-22STATE will process License Applications in the order in which they are received; provided, however, that
when CLEC has multiple Applications on file with AT&T-22STATE, CLEC may designate its desired priority of
completion of pre-licenses and Make-Ready Work with respect to all such Applications.
8.2.1 Each Application for a License under this Section shall specify the proposed route of CLEC’s Facilities and
identify the Conduits and Ducts or Poles, Joint Use Pole(s) and Pole Facilities along the proposed route in
which CLEC desires to place or attach its Facilities, and describe the physical size, weight and jacket
material of the cable which CLEC desires to place in each Conduit or Duct or the number and type of
cables, apparatus enclosures and other Facilities which CLEC desires to attach to each Pole or Joint Use
Pole.
8.2.2 Each Application for a License under this Section shall be accompanied by a proposed (or estimated)
construction schedule containing the information specified in Section 11.1 below of this Appendix, and an
indication of whether CLEC will, at its option, perform its own Make-Ready Work.
8.3 Multiple Cables, Multiple Services, Lashing or Placing Additional Cables, and Replacement of Facilities:
8.3.1 CLEC may include multiple cables in a single License Application and multiple services (e.g., CATV and non
CATV services) may be provided by CLEC in the same cable Sheath. CLEC’s Lashing additional cable to
existing Facilities and placing additional cables in Conduits or Ducts already occupied by CLEC’s Facilities
shall be permitted, and no additional fees will be applied; provided, however, that if CLEC desires to lash

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE
Page 17 of 31
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
additional cable to existing Facilities of a Third Party, CLEC shall provide AT&T-22STATE with reasonable
Notice, and shall obtain written permission from the owner of the existing Facilities. If AT&T-22STATE
determines that the requested Lashing would violate safety or engineering requirements, AT&T-22STATE
shall provide written Notice to CLEC within a reasonable time specifying in detail AT&T-22STATE’s
findings. If CLEC desires to place additional cables in Conduits or Ducts which are already occupied, or to
replace existing Facilities with new Facilities substantially different from those described in Licenses in
effect, CLEC must apply for and acquire a new License specifically describing the physical size, weight and
jacket material of the cable to be placed in AT&T-22STATE’s Conduits and Ducts or the physical size,
weight, and jacket type of cables and the size and weight of apparatus enclosures and other Facilities to be
attached to AT&T-22STATE Poles.
8.4 Each Application shall designate an employee as CLEC’s single point of contact for any and all purposes of that
Application under this Section, including, but not limited to, processing Licenses and providing records and
information. CLEC may at any time designate a new point of contact by giving written Notice of such change while
the Application is open.
9.0 Processing of Applications (Including Pre-License Surveys and Field Inspections)
9.1 CLEC’s Priorities:
9.1.1 When CLEC has multiple Applications on file with AT&T-22STATE, CLEC shall designate its desired priority
of completion of Pre-License Surveys and Make-Ready Work with respect to all such Applications.
9.2 Pre-License Survey:
9.2.1 After CLEC has submitted its written Application for a License, a Pre-License Survey (including a field
inspection) will be performed by either Party, in the company of a representative of the other Party as
mutually agreed, to determine whether AT&T-22STATE’s Poles, Anchors and Anchor/Guy Strands, or
Conduit System, in their present condition, can accommodate CLEC’s Facilities, without substantially
interfering with the ability of AT&T-22STATE or any other authorized person or entity to use or access the
Pole, Anchor or Anchor/Guy Strand or any portion of AT&T-22STATE's Conduit System or Facilities
attached to AT&T-22STATE’s Pole or placed within or connected to AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System. If
a Pre-License Survey is to be conducted by AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC the Costs
to perform the Pre-License Survey. After receipt of CLEC’s payment of Pre-License Survey Costs, AT&T-
22STATE will schedule the survey. If CLEC gives its prior written consent in writing, the determination of
Duct availability may include the rodding of Ducts at CLEC’s expense.
9.2.1.1 The purpose of the Pre-License Survey is to determine whether CLEC’s proposed attachments
to AT&T-22STATE’s Poles or occupancy of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit and Ducts will
substantially interfere with use of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities by AT&T-22STATE and others
with Facilities occupying, connected or attached to AT&T-22STATE's Pole or Conduit System
and to determine what Make-Ready Work is required to accommodate CLEC’s Facilities on
AT&T-22STATE’s Poles, Joint Use Pole(s), or Conduit, Duct, or ROW and the cost associated
with AT&T-22STATE performing such Make-Ready Work and to provide information to CLEC for
its determination of whether the Pole, Anchor, Anchor/Guy Strand, Conduit, Duct, or ROW is
suitable for its use.
9.2.1.2 Based on information provided by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC shall determine whether AT&T-
22STATE's Pole, Anchor, Anchor/Guy Strand, Conduit and Duct Facilities are suitable to meet
CLEC’s needs.
9.2.1.3 AT&T-22STATE may not unreasonably refuse to continue to process an Application based on
AT&T-22STATE’s determination that CLEC’s proposed use of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities will
not be in compliance with applicable requirements, specifications, rules, regulations, ordinances,
and laws. CLEC shall be responsible for making its own, independent determination that its use
of such Facilities will be in compliance with such requirements, specifications, rules, regulations,
ordinances and laws. CLEC acknowledges that AT&T-22STATE is not explicitly or implicitly

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE

14.1.2 Make-Ready Work performed by Attaching Party, or by an Authorized Contractor selected by Attaching
Party, shall be performed in accordance with AT&T-22STATE’s specifications and in accordance with the
same standards and practices which would be followed if such work were being performed by AT&T-
22STATE or AT&T-22STATE’s contractors. Neither Attaching Party nor Authorized Contractors selected by
Attaching Party shall conduct such work in any manner which degrades the integrity of AT&T-22STATE’s
Structures or interferes with any existing use of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities or the Facilities of any other
user.
14.1.3 AT&T-22STATE shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering judgment, whether or not Make-
Ready Work is necessary or possible. In determining whether Make-Ready Work is necessary or what
Make-Ready Work is necessary, AT&T-22STATE shall endeavor to minimize its Costs to CLEC. If it is
determined that such Make-Ready Work is required, AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC with the
estimated Costs for Make-Ready Work and a Make Ready-Work Due Date.
14.1.4 CLEC shall be solely responsible for negotiating with persons or entities other than AT&T-22STATE for the
rearrangement of such persons' or entities' Facilities or structures and, except where such rearrangement is
for the benefit of AT&T-22STATE and/or other CLECs as well as CLEC, shall be solely responsible for
paying all charges attributable to the rearrangement of such Facilities; provided, however, that if Facilities
rearrangements require new Licenses from AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall issue such Licenses in
conjunction with the issuance of the applied-for License to CLEC.
14.2 Rearrangement of CLEC’s Facilities at AT&T-22STATE’s Request:
14.2.1 CLEC acknowledges that, from time to time, it may be necessary or desirable for AT&T-22STATE to

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE
Page 23 of 31
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
contained therein or connected thereto and that such changes may be necessitated by AT&T-22STATE’s
business needs or authorized Application of another entity seeking access to AT&T-22STATE’s Poles or
Conduit Systems. CLEC agrees that CLEC will, upon AT&T-22STATE’s request, and at AT&T-22STATE’s
expense, but at no Cost to CLEC, participate with AT&T-22STATE (and other CLECs) in the relocation,
reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement. CLEC
acknowledges that, from time to time, it may be necessary or desirable for AT&T-22STATE to change out
Poles, relocate, reconstruct, or modify portions of its Conduit System or rearrange Facilities contained
therein or connected thereto as a result of an order by a municipality or other governmental authority. CLEC
shall, upon AT&T-22STATE’s request, participate with AT&T-22STATE (and other CLECs) in the
relocation, reconstruction, or modification of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System or Facilities rearrangement
and pay its proportionate share of any costs of such relocation, reconstruction, or modification that are not
reimbursed by such municipality or governmental authority.
14.2.2 CLEC shall make all rearrangements of its Facilities within such period of time as is jointly deemed
reasonable by the parties based on the amount of rearrangements necessary and a desire to minimize
chances for service interruption or Facility-based service denial to a CLEC End User.
14.2.3 If CLEC fails to make the required rearrangements within the time prescribed or within such extended
periods of time as may be granted by AT&T-22STATE in writing, AT&T-22STATE may perform such
rearrangements with written Notice to CLEC, and CLEC shall reimburse AT&T-22STATE for actual costs
and expenses incurred by AT&T-22STATE in connection with the rearrangement of CLEC’s Facilities;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section or any License issued hereunder shall be
construed as requiring CLEC to bear any expenses which, under the Act or other applicable federal or state
laws or regulations, are to be allocated to persons or entities other than CLEC; and provided further,
however, that CLEC shall have no responsibility for rearrangement costs and expenses relating to
rearrangements performed for the purpose of meeting AT&T-22STATE’s business needs.
15.0 Emergency Repairs and Pole Replacements
15.1 Responsibility for Emergency Repairs; Access to Maintenance Duct:
15.1.1 In general, each Party shall be responsible for making emergency repairs to its own Facilities and for
formulating appropriate plans and practices enabling such Party to make such repairs.
15.1.2 Nothing contained in this Appendix shall be construed as requiring either Party to perform any repair or
service restoration work of any kind with respect to the other Party’s Facilities or the Facilities of joint users.
15.1.3 Maintenance Ducts shall be available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for emergency repair activities by any
entity with Facilities in the Conduit section in which the maintenance Duct is located; provided, however, that
an entity using the maintenance Duct for emergency repair activities will notify AT&T-22STATE within
twelve (12) hours of the current Business Day (or first Business Day following a non-business day) that such
entity is entering the AT&T-22STATE Conduit system and using the maintenance Duct for emergency
restoral purposes. The notice will include a description of the emergency and non-emergency services
involved and an estimate of the completion time. Maintenance Ducts will be used to restore the highest
priority services, first. Existing spare Ducts may be used for restoration purposes providing the spare Ducts
are restored after restoration work is complete. Any spare Ducts not returned will be included to be
assigned to the user of the Duct and an occupancy permit issued.
15.1.4 The Attaching Party shall either vacate the maintenance Duct within thirty (30) calendar days or, with AT&T-
22STATE’s consent, rearrange its Facilities to ensure that at least one full-sized replacement maintenance
Duct (or, if the designated maintenance Duct was an inner-Duct, a suitable replacement inner-Duct) is
available for use by all occupants in the Conduit section within thirty (30) calendar days after such Attaching
Party occupies the maintenance Ducts. If Attaching Party fails to vacate the maintenance Duct as described
above, AT&T-22STATE may install a maintenance conduit at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.2 Designation of Emergency Repair Coordinators and Other Information:

15.2.1 For each AT&T-22STATE construction district, Attaching Party shall provide AT&T-22STATE with the
emergency contact number of Attaching Party’s designated point of contact for coordinating the handling of
emergency repairs of Attaching Party’s Facilities and shall thereafter notify AT&T-22STATE of changes to
such information.
15.3 Order of Precedence of Work Operations; Access to Maintenance Duct and Other Unoccupied Ducts in Emergency
Situations:
15.3.1 When notice and coordination are practicable, AT&T-22STATE, Attaching Party, and other affected parties
shall coordinate repair and other work operations in emergency situations involving service disruptions.
Disputes will be immediately resolved at the site by the affected parties present in accordance with the
following principles.
15.3.2 Emergency service restoration work requirements shall take precedence over other work operations.
15.3.3 Except as otherwise agreed upon by the parties, restoration of lines for emergency services providers (e.g.,
911, fire, police, national security and hospital lines) shall be given the highest priority and temporary
occupancy of the maintenance Duct (and, if necessary, other unoccupied Ducts) shall be assigned in a
manner consistent with this priority. Secondary priority shall be given to restoring services to the local
service providers with the greatest numbers of local lines out of service due to the emergency being
rectified. The parties shall exercise good faith in assigning priorities, shall base their decisions on the best
information then available to them at the site in question, and may, by mutual agreement at the site, take
other factors into consideration in assigning priorities and sequencing service restoration activities.
15.3.4 AT&T-22STATE shall determine the order of precedence of work operations and assignment of Duct space
in the maintenance Duct (and other unoccupied Ducts) only if the affected parties present are unable to
reach consensus provided, however, that these decisions shall be made by AT&T-22STATE on a
nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the principles set forth in this section.
15.4 Emergency Pole Replacements
15.4.1 When emergency pole replacements are required, AT&T-22STATE shall promptly make a good faith effort
to contact Attaching Party to notify Attaching Party of the emergency and to determine whether Attaching
Party will respond to the emergency in a timely manner.
15.4.2 If notified by AT&T-22STATE that an emergency exists which will require the replacement of a pole,
Attaching Party shall transfer its Facilities immediately, provided such transfer is necessary to rectify the
emergency. If the transfer is to an AT&T-22STATE replacement pole, the transfer shall be in accordance
with AT&T-22STATE’s placement instructions.
15.4.3 If Attaching Party is unable to respond to the emergency situation immediately, Attaching Party shall so
advise AT&T-22STATE and thereby authorize AT&T-22STATE (or any Other User sharing the pole with
AT&T-22STATE) to perform such emergency-necessitated transfers (and associated Facilities
rearrangements) on Attaching Party’s behalf at the Attaching Party’s expense.
15.5 Expenses Associated with Emergency Repairs:
15.5.1 Each Party shall bear all reasonable expenses arising out of or in connection with emergency repairs of its
own Facilities and transfers or rearrangements of such Facilities associated with emergency pole
replacements made in accordance with the provisions of this article.
15.5.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for paying all persons and entities that provide materials, labor,
access to real or personal property, or other goods or services in connection with any such repair, transfer,
or rearrangement of such Party’s Facilities.
15.5.3 Attaching Party shall reimburse AT&T-22STATE for the Costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE for work

16.1 AT&T-22STATE may monitor, at CLEC’s expense, the entrance and exit of CLEC’s Facilities into AT&T-22STATE’s
Manholes and the placement of CLEC’s Facilities in AT&T-22STATE’s Manholes.
16.2 Post-Construction Inspections:
16.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will, at the Attaching Party’s expense, conduct a post-construction inspection of the
Attaching Party’s attachment of Facilities to AT&T-22STATE’s Structures for the purpose of determining the
conformance of the attachments to the occupancy permit. AT&T-22STATE will provide the Attaching Party
advance written Notice of proposed date and time of the post-construction inspection. The Attaching Party
may accompany AT&T-22STATE on the post-construction inspection.
16.3 Periodic or Spot Inspections:
16.3.1 AT&T-22STATE shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make Periodic or Spot Inspections of all
Facilities attached to AT&T-22STATE’s Structure. Periodic Inspections will not be made more often than
once every two (2) years, unless in AT&T-22STATE’s judgment, such inspections are required for reasons
involving safety or because of an alleged violation of the terms of this Appendix.
16.3.2 AT&T-22STATE will give CLEC advance written Notice of such inspections, and CLEC shall have the right
to have a representative attend such inspections, except in those instances where safety considerations
justify the need for such inspection without the delay of waiting until written Notice has been forwarded to
CLEC.
16.3.3 Such inspections shall be conducted at AT&T-22STATE’s expense; provided, however, that CLEC shall
bear the Costs of inspections as delineated in Sections 16.1 above and 16.2.1 above.
16.3.4 If Attaching Party’s Facilities are in compliance with this Appendix, there will be no charges incurred by the
Attaching Party for the periodic or spot inspection. If Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with
this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE may charge Attaching Party for the inspection. The Costs of Periodic
Inspections will be paid by those Attaching Parties with 2% or greater of their Attachments in violation. The
amount paid by the Attaching Party shall be the percentage that their violations bear to the total violations of
all Attaching Parties found during the inspection.
16.3.5 If the inspection reflects that Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in compliance with the terms of this
Appendix, Attaching Party shall bring its Facilities into compliance within thirty (30) calendar days after being
notified of such noncompliance. If any make ready or modification work to AT&T-22STATE’s Structures is
required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the Attaching Party shall provide Notice to
AT&T-22STATE and the make ready work or modification will be treated in the same fashion as make
ready work or modifications for a new request for attachment. If the violation creates a hazardous condition,
Facilities must be brought into compliance upon notification.
16.4 Neither the act of inspection by AT&T-22STATE of CLEC’s Facilities nor any failure to inspect such Facilities shall
operate to impose on AT&T-22STATE any liability of any kind whatsoever or to relieve CLEC of any responsibility,
obligations or liability under this Section or otherwise existing.
16.5 Notice of Noncompliance:
16.5.1 If, at any time, AT&T-22STATE determines that Attaching Party’s Facilities or any part thereof have not
been placed or maintained or are not being used in accordance with the requirements of this Appendix,
AT&T-22STATE may send written Notice to Attaching Party specifying the alleged noncompliance.
Attaching Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of the Notice as soon as practicable. If Attaching Party does
not dispute AT&T-22STATE’s assertion that such Facilities are not in compliance, Attaching Party agrees to
provide AT&T-22STATE with a schedule for bringing such Facilities into compliance, to bring the Facilities
into compliance within a reasonable time, and to notify AT&T-22STATE in writing when the Facilities have
been brought into compliance.

16.6 Disputes over Alleged Noncompliance:
16.6.1 If Attaching Party disputes AT&T-22STATE’s assertion that Attaching Party’s Facilities are not in
compliance, Attaching Party shall notify AT&T-22STATE in writing of the basis for Attaching Party’s
assertion that its Facilities are in compliance.
16.7 Failure to Bring Facilities into Compliance:
16.7.1 If Attaching Party has not brought the Facilities into compliance within a reasonable time or provided AT&T-
22STATE with proof sufficient to persuade AT&T-22STATE that AT&T-22STATE erred in asserting that the
Facilities were not in compliance, and if AT&T-22STATE determines in good faith that the alleged
noncompliance causes or is likely to cause material damage to AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities or those of other
users, AT&T-22STATE may, at its option and Attaching Party’s expense, take such non-service affecting
steps as may be required to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, including but not limited to
correcting any conditions which do not meet the specifications of this Appendix.
16.8 Correction of Conditions by AT&T-22STATE:
16.8.1 If AT&T-22STATE elects to bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance, the provisions of this section
shall apply.
16.8.2 AT&T-22STATE will, whenever practicable, notify CLEC in writing before performing such work. The
written Notice shall describe the nature of the work to be performed and AT&T-22STATE’s schedule for
performing the work.

supports located within an AT&T-22STATE Manhole, AT&T-22STATE may, at Attaching Party’s expense,
reattach them but shall not be obligated to do so. If AT&T-22STATE does not reattach Attaching Party’s
Facilities, AT&T-22STATE shall endeavor to arrange with Attaching Party for the reattachment of any
Facilities affected.
16.8.4 AT&T-22STATE shall, as soon as practicable after performing the work, advise Attaching Party in writing of
the work performed or action taken. Upon receiving such Notice, Attaching Party shall inspect the Facilities
and take such steps as Attaching Party may deem necessary to insure that the Facilities meet Attaching
Party’s performance requirements.
16.8.5 Attaching Party to Bear Expenses:
16.8.5.1 Attaching Party shall bear all expenses arising out of or in connection with any work performed to
bring Attaching Party’s Facilities into compliance with this Section; provided, however that
nothing contained in this Section or any License issued hereunder shall be construed as
requiring Attaching Party to bear any expenses which, under applicable federal or state laws or
regulations, must be borne by persons or entities other than Attaching Party.
17.0 Notice of Noncompliance
17.1 Disputes over Alleged Noncompliance:
17.1.1 If CLEC disputes AT&T-22STATE’s assertion that CLEC’s Facilities are not in compliance, CLEC shall
notify AT&T-22STATE in writing of the basis for CLEC’s assertion that its Facilities are in compliance.
18.0 Unauthorized Occupancy or Utilization of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities
18.1 Tagging of Facilities and Unauthorized Attachments:
18.1.1 Facilities to Be Marked:
18.1.1.1 Attaching Party shall tag or otherwise mark all of Attaching Party’s Facilities placed on or in
AT&T-22STATE’s Structure in a manner sufficient to identify the Facilities as those belonging to
the Attaching Party.

18.1.2 Removal of Untagged Facilities:
18.1.2.1 AT&T-22STATE may, without notice to any person or entity, remove from AT&T-22STATE’s
poles or any part of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System the Attaching Party’s Facilities, if AT&T-
22STATE determines that such Facilities are not the subject of a current occupancy permit and
are not otherwise lawfully present on AT&T-22STATE’s poles or in AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit
System.
18.2 Notice to Attaching Party:
18.2.1 If any of Attaching Party’s Facilities for which no occupancy permit is presently in effect are found attached
to AT&T-22STATE’s Poles or Anchors or within any part of AT&T-22STATE’s Conduit System, AT&T-
22STATE, without prejudice to other rights or remedies available to AT&T-22STATE under this Appendix,
and without prejudice to any rights or remedies which may exist independent of this Appendix, shall send a
written Notice to Attaching Party advising Attaching Party that no occupancy permit is presently in effect with
respect to the Facilities. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving a Notice, Attaching Party shall
acknowledge receipt of the Notice by submitting to AT&T-22STATE, in writing, an Application for a new or
amended Occupancy permit with respect to such Facilities.
18.3 Approval of Request and Retroactive Charges:
18.3.1 If AT&T-22STATE approves Attaching Party’s Application for a new or amended Occupancy permit,
Attaching Party shall be liable to AT&T-22STATE for all fees and charges associated with the unauthorized
attachments as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this Agreement. The issuance of a new or amended
occupancy permit as provided by this article shall not operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-
22STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this Appendix or otherwise.
18.3.2 Attachment and Occupancy fees and charges shall continue to accrue until the unauthorized Facilities are
removed from AT&T-22STATE’s Poles, Conduit System or ROW or until a new or amended Occupancy
permit is issued and shall include, but not be limited to, all fees and charges which would have been due
and payable if Attaching Party and its predecessors had continuously complied with all applicable AT&T-
22STATE licensing requirements. Such fees and charges shall be due and payable thirty (30) calendar
days after the date of the bill or invoice stating such fees and charges. In addition, the Attaching Party shall
be liable for an unauthorized Attachment and/or Occupancy fee as specified in the Pricing Schedule to this
Agreement. Payment of such fees shall be deemed liquidated damages and not a penalty. In addition,
Attaching Party shall rearrange or remove its unauthorized Facilities at AT&T-22STATE’s request to comply
with applicable placement standards, shall remove its Facilities from any space occupied by or assigned to
AT&T-22STATE or another Other User, and shall pay AT&T-22STATE for all Costs incurred by AT&T-
22STATE in connection with any rearrangements, modifications, or replacements necessitated as a result of
the presence of Attaching Party’s unauthorized Facilities.
18.4 Removal of Unauthorized Attachments:
18.4.1 If Attaching Party does not obtain a new or amended occupancy permit with respect to unauthorized
Facilities within the specified period of time, AT&T-22STATE shall by written Notice advise Attaching Party
to remove its unauthorized Facilities not less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of Notice and
Attaching Party shall remove the Facilities within the time specified in the Notice. If the Facilities have not
been removed within the time specified in the Notice, AT&T-22STATE may, at AT&T-22STATE’s option,
remove Attaching Party’s Facilities at Attaching Party’s expense.
18.5 No Ratification of Unpermitted Attachments or Unauthorized Use of AT&T-22STATE’s Facilities:
18.5.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-22STATE with regard to any unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or
unauthorized use of AT&T-22STATE’s Structure shall be deemed to constitute a ratification by AT&T-
22STATE of the unauthorized Attachment or Occupancy or use, nor shall the payment by Attaching Party of
fees and charges for unauthorized Pole attachments or Conduit Occupancy exonerate Attaching Party from
liability for any trespass or other illegal or wrongful conduct in connection with the placement or use of such

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
unauthorized Facilities.
18.5.2 Nothing contained in the Appendix or any License issued hereunder shall be construed as requiring CLEC
to bear any expenses which, under applicable federal or state laws or regulations, must be borne by
persons or entities other than CLEC.
18.6 Prompt Payment of Applicable Fees and Charges:
18.6.1 Fees and charges for Pole Attachments and Conduit System Occupancies, as specified herein and as
modified from time to time, shall be due and payable immediately whether or not CLEC is permitted to
continue the Pole Attachment or Conduit Occupancy. See the Pricing Schedule for applicable annual rental
fees.
18.7 No Implied Waiver or Ratification of Unauthorized Use:
18.7.1 No act or failure to act by AT&T-22STATE with regard to said unlicensed use shall be deemed as a
ratification of the unlicensed use; and if any License should be subsequently issued, said License shall not
operate retroactively or constitute a waiver by AT&T-22STATE of any of its rights or privileges under this
Appendix or otherwise; provided, however, that CLEC shall be subject to all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities of this Appendix in regard to said unauthorized use from its inception.
19.0 Removal of CLEC’s Facilities
19.1 When Applicant no longer intends to occupy space on an AT&T-22STATE Pole or in a AT&T-22STATE Duct or
Conduit, Applicant will provide written notification to AT&T-22STATE that it wishes to terminate the Occupancy
permit with respect to such space and will remove its Facilities from the space described in the Notice. Upon removal
of Applicant’s Facilities, the Occupancy permit shall terminate and the space shall be available for reassignment.

(30) calendar days after the date Attaching Party replaces existing Facilities on a Pole or in a Conduit with
substitute Facilities on the same Pole or in the same Conduit.
19.5 Removal to Avoid Forfeiture:
19.5.1 If the presence of Attaching Party’s Facilities on or in AT&T-22STATE’s Structure would cause a forfeiture
of the rights of AT&T-22STATE to occupy the property where such Structure is located, AT&T-22STATE
will promptly notify Attaching Party in writing and Attaching Party shall not, without due cause and
justification, refuse to remove its Facilities within such time as may be required to prevent such forfeiture.
AT&T-22STATE will give Attaching Party not less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of Notice to
remove Attaching Party’s Facilities unless prior removal is required to prevent the forfeiture of AT&T-

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE
Page 29 of 31
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
22STATE’s rights. At Attaching Party’s request, the Parties will engage in good faith negotiations with each
other, with Other Users, and with Third Party property owners and cooperatively take such other steps as
may be necessary to avoid the unnecessary removal of Attaching Party’s Facilities.
19.6 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-22STATE; Notice of Intent to Remove:
19.6.1 If Attaching Party fails to remove its Facilities from AT&T-22STATE’s Structure in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 19.1-19.5 of this Appendix, AT&T-22STATE may remove such Facilities and store
them at Attaching Party’s expense in a public warehouse or elsewhere without being deemed guilty of
trespass or conversion and without becoming liable to Attaching Party for any injury, loss, or damage
resulting from such actions. AT&T-22STATE shall give Attaching Party not less than thirty (30) calendar
days prior written Notice of its intent to remove Attaching Party’s Facilities pursuant to this Section.
19.7 Removal of Facilities by AT&T-22STATE:
19.7.1 If AT&T-22STATE removes any of Attaching Party’s Facilities pursuant to this article, Attaching Party shall
reimburse AT&T-22STATE for AT&T-22STATE’s Costs in connection with the removal, storage, delivery, or
other disposition of the removed Facilities.

requested, of the rental rate and Pole transfer rate to be applied in the subsequent calendar year. The letter
of notification shall be incorporated in, and governed by, the terms and conditions of this Appendix.
Attachment and Occupancy rates shall be applied to the number of Pole(s) and Duct feet of Conduit for
which Licenses have been issued before December 1 of each calendar year. Charges for Attachment(s) and
Occupancy which commenced during the preceding twelve (12) month period will be prorated accordingly.
20.4 Rate “True-Up”:
20.4.1 The Parties agree that the fees reflected as interim herein shall be “trued-up” (up or down) based on final
fees either determined by further agreement or by an effective order, in a proceeding involving AT&T-
22STATE before the Commission, in the state which CLEC has either attached to or occupied AT&T-
22STATE structures (ROW, Conduits, Ducts, and/or Poles).
20.4.2 Under the “True-Up” process, the interim fees for each structure shall be multiplied by the volume of that

Attachment 03 - Structure Access/AT&T-22STATE
Page 30 of 31
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
Price”). The final fees for that structure shall be multiplied by the volume of that structure either attached to
or occupied by CLEC to arrive at the total final amount due (“Total Final Price”). The Total Interim Price
shall be compared with the Total Final Price. If the Total Final Price is more than the Total Interim Price,
CLEC shall pay the difference to AT&T-22STATE. If the Total Final Price is less than the Total Interim
Price, AT&T-22STATE shall pay the difference to CLEC.
20.4.3 Each Party shall keep its own records upon which a “True-Up” can be based and any final payment from
one Party to the other shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Parties based on such records. In the event
of any disagreement as between the records or the Parties regarding the amount of such “True-Up,” the
Parties agree to follow the Dispute Resolution Process in the General Terms & Conditions to this
Agreement.
21.0 Advance Payment
21.1 Attachment and Occupancy Fees:

physical repair of such Facilities damaged by the negligence of AT&T-22STATE, its employees, agents,
contractors, subcontractors or invitees. However, AT&T-22STATE shall not be liable to CLEC for any
interruption of CLEC’s service or for interference with the operation of CLEC’s Facilities, or for any special,
indirect, or consequential damages arising in any manner, including AT&T-22STATE’s negligence, out of
the use of Pole(s), Anchor(s), or Conduit Systems or AT&T-22STATE’s actions or omissions in regard
thereto and CLEC shall indemnify and save harmless AT&T-22STATE from and against any and all claims,

Page 3 of 7
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Nothing in this Attachment shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely impact in any manner either Party’s right
to employ or to request and be assigned any North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number resources from the
numbering administrator including, but not limited to, central office (NXX) codes pursuant to the Central Office Code
(NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s website) or thousand-blocks (NXX-X)
pursuant to the Thousands-Blocking Pooling Administration Guidelines (most current version specified on Telcordia’s
website), or to establish, by tariff or otherwise, Exchanges and Rate Centers corresponding to such NXX codes.
Each Party is responsible for administering the NXX codes it is assigned.
1.2 Prior to providing local service in an AT&T-22STATE local Exchange Area, CLEC shall obtain a separate numbering
resource (NXX or NXX-X) for each AT&T-22STATE Rate Center to ensure compliance with the industry-approved
Central Office Code (NXX) Assignment Guidelines (most current version) or other industry approved numbering
guidelines and the FCC’s Second Report & Order in CC Docket 95-116, released August 18, 1997 (Local Number
Portability). This will enable the Parties to identify the jurisdictional nature of traffic for Intercompany compensation
until such time as both Parties have implemented billing and routing capabilities to determine traffic jurisdiction on a
basis other than an NXX or an NXX-X.
1.3 Parties shall assign telephone numbers only to those End Users that are physically in the Rate Center to which the
NXX is assigned, subject to exceptions as noted in the numbering resource guidelines.
1.4 Each Party is responsible to program and update its own switches and network systems to recognize and route traffic
to the other Party’s assigned NXX codes at all times. Neither Party shall impose fees or charges on the other Party
for such required programming and updating activities.
1.5 Each Party is responsible to input required data into the Routing Data Base Systems (RDBS) and into the Telcordia
Business Integrated Routing and Rating Database System (BIRRDS) or other appropriate system(s) necessary to
update the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), unless negotiated otherwise.
1.6 Neither Party is responsible for notifying the other Party’s End Users of any changes in dialing arrangements,
including those due to NPA relief.
1.7 NXX Migration:
1.7.1 Where either Party has activated an entire NXX for a single End User, or activated more than half of an NXX
for a single End User with the remaining numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use or otherwise
unused, and such End User chooses to receive service from the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate
with the second Party to have the entire NXX reassigned in the LERG (and associated industry databases,
routing tables, etc.) to an End Office operated by the second Party provided that the requested rate center is
the same rate center that physically serves the End User in a non-Foreign Exchange arrangement. Such
transfer will require development of a transition process to minimize impact on the Network and on the End
User(s)’ service and will be subject to appropriate industry lead times (currently forty-five (45) calendar
days) for movements of NXXs from one switch to another. The Parties shall not charge each other as a
means for the other to recover costs associated with NXX Migration.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Foreign Exchange” or “FX”, as used in this Attachment, refers to number assignments and moves outside the Rate
Centers with which a telephone number is ordinarily associated, and is different from the term “FX” in Attachment 02
- Network Interconnection, which refers to number assignment and moves outside of a mandatory local calling area.
2.2 “Service Management System” or “SMS”, as used in the Attachment, is a database or computer system not part of
the public switched network that, (1) interconnects to a Service Control Point (SCP), and sends to that SCP the
information and call processing instructions needed for a network switch to process and complete a telephone call;
and (2) provides telecommunications carriers with the capability of entering and storing data regarding the processing
and completing of a telephone call.

Page 4 of 7
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
2.3 “Service Provider Number Portability (SPNP) Data Base Query” means the End User terminating calls from the “N-1”
Network to numbers in the Telephone Company’s network with NXX codes that have been designated as number
portable and the NXX has at least one number ported. AT&T-22STATE may be responsible for making a query to a
database containing information necessary to route calls to number portable NXX codes.
2.4 “Intermediate Numbers” means the numbers provided for use by resellers, numbers in dealer numbering pools,
numbers preprogrammed into End User premises equipment offered for retail sale, and numbers assigned to
messaging service providers.
2.5 “Safety Valve Request” means a mechanism for carriers to request numbering resources apart from the general
waiver process.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 Requirements for LNP:
3.1.1 The Parties shall provide to each other, on a reciprocal basis, number portability in accordance with
requirements of the Act and FCC Rules and Orders.
3.1.2 The Parties shall follow industry guidelines, including but not limited to North American Numbering Council
(NANC) Inter Service Provider Operations Flows, located on the Number Portability Administration Center's
(NPAC) website, regarding LNP for all aspects of number portability, including the time frames for providing
porting services to one another.
3.1.3 Either Party shall be permitted to block default-routed calls to protect the public switched telephone network
from overload, congestion, or failure propagation.
3.1.4 When a ported telephone number becomes vacant (e.g., the telephone number is no longer in service with
the original End User), the ported telephone number will be released back to the carrier owning the switch
(after aging if any) in which the telephone number’s NXX-X is native.
3.1.5 Each Party shall be responsible for the End User’s other Telecommunications related services and features,
(e.g., Directory Listings, E911, Line Information Database (LIDB), Operator Services), once that Party has
ported the End User’s telephone number to the Party’s switch.
3.1.6 When purchasing the SPNP Database Query, CLEC will access AT&T-22STATE facilities via an SS7 link.
3.1.7 Where triggers are not set, the Parties shall coordinate the porting of the number between service providers
so as to minimize service interruptions to the End User.
3.2 Limitations of Service for LNP:
3.2.1 Telephone numbers can be ported only within the Toll Message Rate Centers (TMRCs) as approved by the
Commissions. “Porting within Rate Centers” refers to a limitation of changing service providers while the
physical location of the End User remains with the wireline footprint of the Rate Center. If the End User
changes his, her or its physical location from one Rate Center to another, the End User may not retain his,
her or its telephone number (which is associated with the End User’s previous Rate Center) as a basic
network (non-FX) offering. An End User may retain his, her or its telephone number when moving from one
Rate Center to another by the use of a tariff FX or Remote Call Forwarding offering from the new service
provider.
3.2.2 Telephone numbers of the following types shall not be ported:
3.2.2.1 AT&T-22STATE Official Communications Services (OCS) NXXs;
3.2.2.2 555, 950, 956, 976 and 900 numbers;
3.2.2.3 N11 numbers (e.g., 411 and 911);
3.2.2.4 Toll-free service numbers (e.g., 800, 888, 877 and 866); and

Attachment 04 - Local Number Portability and Numbering/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
3.2.2.5 Disconnected or unassigned numbers.
3.2.3 Telephone numbers with NXXs dedicated to choke/High Volume Call-In (HVCI) networks are not portable
via LRN. Choke numbers will be ported as described in Section 4.4.7.2 below of this Attachment.
3.3 Numbering:
3.3.1 If fulfilling CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers results in AT&T-22STATE having to submit a request
for additional telephone numbers to a national numbering administrator (either NANPA CO Code
Administration, NeuStar Pooling Administration or their successors), AT&T-22STATE will submit the
required numbering request to the national numbering administrator to satisfy CLEC’s request for
intermediate numbers. AT&T-22STATE will also pursue all appropriate steps (including submitting a Safety
Valve Request (petition) to the Commission if the numbering request is denied by the national administrator)
to satisfy CLEC’s request for intermediate numbers. In these cases, AT&T-22STATE is not obligated to
fulfill the request by CLEC for intermediate numbers unless, and until, AT&T-22STATE’s request for
additional numbering resources is granted.
3.3.2 CLEC agrees to supply supporting information for any numbering request and/or Safety Valve Request that
AT&T-22STATE files pursuant to Section 3.3.1 above.
3.3.3 Each Party is responsible for providing to the other, valid test numbers; one number terminating to a voice
announcement identifying the Company and one number terminating to a milliwatt tone providing answer
supervision and allowing simultaneous connection from multiple test lines. Both numbers should remain in
service indefinitely for regressive testing purposes.
3.4 Local Number Portability (LNP) and Numbering:
3.4.1 Porting of Resale Numbers:
3.4.1.1 As the network provider, AT&T-22STATE will port telephone numbers, both in and out, on behalf
of CLEC at the request of an End User. CLEC will provide to AT&T-22STATE such information as
required to issue Local Service Requests (LSR) to port numbers in.
3.5 Non-discriminatory Access to Telephone Numbers:
3.5.1 Where AT&T-22STATE provides Resale services, AT&T-22STATE will provide telephone numbers as
defined by applicable FCC rules and regulations on a first come first served basis. CLEC acknowledges
that such access to telephone numbers shall be in accordance with the appropriate FCC rules, regulations
and industry guidelines.
4.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
4.1 Service Description for LNP:
4.1.1 The LRN software of the switch in which the assigned numbering resource (e.g., NXX or NXX-X) is native
determines if the called party is in a portable NXX. When a calling Party places a telephone call, if the
called party is in a portable NXX, a query will be launched to the LNP database to determine whether or not
the called number has been ported.
4.1.2 When the called number has been ported, an LRN will be returned to the switch that launched the query.
Following the query, the LRN of the called number will appear in the Called Party Number (CdPN) field of
the SS7 message and the called number will appear in the Generic Address Parameter (GAP) field.
4.1.3 When the query does not return an LRN, the call will be completed based upon the dialed digits.
4.1.4 When the LNP database is queried, the Forward Call Identifier (FCI) field’s entry will be changed from 0 to 1
by the switch triggering the query, regardless of whether the called number has been ported or not.
4.1.5 Where technically feasible, the Parties shall populate the Jurisdiction Information Parameter (JIP) field with
the first six (6) digits (NPA NXX format) of the appropriate LRN of the originating switch.

4.2 “N-1” Query Methodology for LNP:
4.2.1 The Parties shall follow the “N-1” query methodology in performing queries of the LNP database, as
provided below. As provided by Industry standards, the “N-1” carrier is the carrier in the call routing
sequence immediately prior to the terminating carrier’s End Office, or the terminating carrier’s End Office
tandem. The “N-1” carrier shall perform the LNP database query. If the “N-1” carrier fails to perform the
LNP database query, the terminating carrier shall perform a query of the LNP database, and shall be
permitted to charge the “N-1” carrier for the query. Refer to the LNP Working Group Best Practice for
additional information, located in the Local Number Portability Administration section of the NPAC website.
4.2.2 For interLATA or intraLATA toll calls carried by another carrier, the originating carrier will pass the call to the
appropriate toll carrier, which will perform a query of the LNP database and efficiently route the call to the
appropriate terminating local carrier, either directly or through an access tandem office. Where one carrier
is the originating local service provider (LSP) and the other carrier is the designated toll carrier, the
designated toll carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating LSP will not query toll calls delivered to the toll
carrier or charge the toll carrier for such queries.
4.2.3 For local calls to ported numbers, the originating carrier is the “N-1” carrier. The originating carrier will query
the LNP database and route the call to the appropriate terminating carrier.
4.2.4 For local calls to any NXX from which at least one number has been ported, the Party that owns the
originating switch shall query an LNP database as soon as the call reaches the first LNP-capable switch in
the call path. The Party that owns the originating switch shall query on a local call to an NXX in which at
least one number has been ported via LNP prior to any attempts to route the call to any other switch. Prior
to the first number in an NXX being ported via LNP, AT&T-22STATE may query all calls directed to that
NXX, provided that AT&T-22STATE’s queries shall not adversely affect the quality of service to CLEC’s End
Users as compared to the service AT&T-22STATE provides its own End Users, and that queries to NXXs
where the first number has not been ported are not charged to the “N-1” Carrier.
4.2.5 A Party shall be charged for an LNP query by the other Party only if the Party to be charged is the N-1
carrier and was obligated to perform the LRN query but failed to do so, pursuant to conditions set forth in
CFR 47, Section 52.33. The only exception will be if the FCC rules (Docket No. 95-116) that the terminating
carrier may charge the “N-1” carrier for queries initiated before the first number is ported in an NXX.
4.2.6 Rates, terms and conditions for LNP queries performed by AT&T-22STATE are set forth in the applicable
FCC Tariff.
4.3 Ordering for LNP:
4.3.1 Porting of numbers from NXXs marked as portable in the LERG will be initiated via LSRs based on Ordering
and Billing Forum (OBF) guidelines and in accordance with the provisions of Attachment 07 - Operations
Support System (OSS).
4.3.2 For the purposes of this Attachment, the Parties may use a project management approach for the
implementation of LSRs for large quantities of ported numbers or for complex porting processes. With
regard to such managed projects, the Parties may negotiate implementation details such as, but not limited
to: Due Date, Cutover Intervals and Times, Coordination of Technical Resources, and Completion Notice.
4.4 Provisioning for LNP:
4.4.1 The Parties will remove a ported number from the End Office from which the number is being ported as
close to the requested time as reasonably practicable, except under the conditions listed in Section 4.4.3
below and Section 4.4.4 below, respectively. The Parties recognize that it is in the best interest of the End
User for this removal to be completed in the most expedient manner possible.
4.4.2 Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger. If the Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger is set, calls originating from the old
switch will query the database and route to the new switch without the number being disconnected. The
ported number must be removed at the same time that the Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger is removed.

Attachment 04 - Local Number Portability and Numbering/AT&T-22STATE
Page 7 of 7
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
4.4.2.1 The Parties agree to provide Unconditional Ten-Digit Trigger wherever technically feasible.
4.4.3 Project Orders. For project requests, the Parties will negotiate time frames for the disconnection of the
numbers in the old switch.
4.4.4 Coordinated Orders. Orders worked on a coordinated basis will be coordinated by the Parties until the
numbers are disconnected in the old switch.
4.4.5 The Parties shall cooperate in the process of porting numbers from one carrier to another so as to limit
service outage for the affected End User. The Parties will use their best efforts to update their respective
Local Service Management Systems (LSMS) from the NPAC SMS data within fifteen (15) minutes after
receipt of a download from the NPAC SMS (the current NANC goal for such updating).
4.4.6 At the time a telephone number is ported via LNP, the Party from which the number is being ported shall
insure that the LIDB entry for that number is de-provisioned.
4.4.7 Mass Calling:
4.4.7.1 The HVCI Network is designed to ease the network congestion that occurs when large numbers of
incoming telephone calls are solicited by an End User, such as a radio station or a ticket agency.
4.4.7.1.1 HVCI is also known as:
4.4.7.1.1.1 Choke Network
4.4.7.1.1.2 Mass Calling
4.4.7.1.1.3 Public Response Choke Network
4.4.7.2 Using a non-LRN process, AT&T-22STATE will offer the ability to port telephone numbers with
mass calling NXX codes via the use of pseudo codes or route index numbers.
4.4.8 Operator Services, LIDB and Directory Assistance:
4.4.8.1 The Provisions of this Agreement pertaining to Operator Services, LIDB and Directory Assistance
shall also apply when LNP is in place.
4.4.9 Porting of Direct Inward Dialing (DID) Block Numbers:
4.4.9.1 DID block numbers shall be portable in the same manner as other local telephone numbers,
subject to the modifications and/or limitations provided herein.
4.4.9.2 The Parties shall offer LNP to End Users for any portion of an existing DID block without being
required to port the entire block of DID numbers.
4.4.9.3 The Parties shall permit End Users which port a portion of DID numbers to retain DID service on
the remaining portion of the DID numbers, provided such is consistent with applicable tariffs.
5.0 Other
5.1 Pricing for LNP:
5.1.1 With the exception of lawful query charges, the Parties shall not charge each other for the porting of
telephone numbers as a means for the other to recover the costs associated with LNP.

911 ALI to the PSAP for display. If no ANI is forwarded by CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will forward an
Emergency Service Central Office (ESCO) identification code for display at the PSAP. If ANI is forwarded
by the CLEC, but no ALI record is found in the E911 DBMS, AT&T-22STATE will report this “No Record
Found” condition to the CLEC in accordance with NENA standards.
3.3 Facilities and Trunking:
3.3.1 AT&T-22STATE shall provide and maintain sufficient dedicated E911 Trunks from AT&T-22STATE’s E911
SR to the PSAP of the E911 Customer, according to provisions of the appropriate state Commission-
approved tariff and documented specifications of the E911 Customer.
3.3.2 AT&T-22STATE will provide facilities to interconnect the CLEC to the AT&T-22STATE’s E911SR, as
specified in Attachment 02 -Network Interconnection of this Agreement or per the requirements set forth via
the applicable state tariff. Additionally, CLEC has the option to secure interconnection facilities from another
provider or provide such interconnection using their own facilities. If diverse facilities are requested by
CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will provide such diversity where technically feasible, at standard applicable tariff
rates.
3.4 Database:

4.1.1 CLEC will transport the appropriate 911 calls from each Point of Interconnection (POI) to the appropriate
AT&T-22STATE E911 SR location.
4.1.2 CLEC will forward the ANI information of the party calling 911 to the AT&T-22STATE E911 SR.
4.2 Facilities and Trunking (for CLEC’s own switches):
4.2.1 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to each AT&T-22STATE E911 SR that
serves the Exchange Areas in which CLEC is authorized to and will provide Telephone Exchange Service.
4.2.2 CLEC acknowledges that its End Users in a single local calling scope may be served by different E911 SRs
and CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to route 911 calls from its End Users to
the proper E911 SR.
4.2.3 CLEC shall order a minimum of two (2) one-way outgoing E911 Trunk(s) dedicated for originating 911
Emergency Service calls for each default PSAP or default ESN to interconnect to each appropriate AT&T-
22STATE E911 SR, where applicable. Where Signaling System 7 (SS7) connectivity is available and
required by the applicable E911 Customer, the Parties agree to implement Common Channel Signaling
(CCS) trunking rather than Multi-Frequency (MF) trunking.
4.2.4 CLEC is responsible for ordering a separate E911 Trunk group from AT&T-22STATE for each county,
default PSAP or other geographic area that the CLEC serves if the E911 Customer for such county or
geographic area has a specified varying default routing condition. Where PSAPs do not have the technical
capability to receive 10-digit ANI, E911 traffic must be transmitted over a separate trunk group specific to
the underlying technology. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this
trunk group. Where the parties utilize SS7 signaling and the E911 network has the technology available,
only one (1) E911 Trunk group shall be established to handle multiple NPAs within the local Exchange Area
or LATA. If the E911 network does not have the appropriate technology available, a SS7 trunk group shall
be established per NPA in the local Exchange Area or LATA. In addition, 911 traffic originating in one (1)
NPA must be transmitted over a separate 911 Trunk group from 911 traffic originating in any other NPA 911.
4.2.5 CLEC shall maintain facility transport capacity sufficient to route 911 traffic over trunks dedicated to 911
Interconnection between the CLEC switch and the AT&T-22STATE E911 SR.
4.2.6 CLEC shall order sufficient trunking to route CLEC's originating 911 calls to the designated AT&T-22STATE
E911 SR.
4.2.7 Diverse (i.e., separate) 911 facilities are highly recommended and may be required by the Commission or
E911 Customer. If required by the E911 Customer, diverse 911 Trunks shall be ordered in the same
fashion as the primary 911 Trunks. CLEC is responsible for initiating trunking and facility orders for diverse
routes for 911 Interconnection.
4.2.8 CLEC is responsible for determining the proper quantity of trunks and transport facilities from its switch (es)
to interconnect with the AT&T-22STATE E911 SR.
4.2.9 CLEC shall engineer its 911 Trunks to attain a minimum P.01 grade of service as measured using the time
consistent average busy season busy hour twenty (20) day averaged loads applied to industry standard
Neal-Wilkinson Trunk Group Capacity algorithms (using Medium day-to-day Variation and 1.0 Peakedness
factor), or such other minimum grade of service as required by Applicable Law.
4.2.10 CLEC shall monitor its 911 Trunks for the purpose of determining originating network traffic volumes. If
CLEC's traffic study indicates that additional 911 Trunks are needed to meet the current level of 911 call
volumes, CLEC shall provision additional 911 Trunks for Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE.
4.2.11 CLEC is responsible for the isolation, coordination and restoration of all 911 facility and trunking
maintenance problems from CLEC’s demarcation (for example, collocation) to the AT&T-22STATE E911
SR(s). CLEC is responsible for advising AT&T-22STATE of the 911 Trunk identification and the fact that
the trunks are dedicated for 911 traffic when notifying AT&T-22STATE of a failure or outage. The Parties

agree to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve any 911 outage. AT&T-22STATE will refer
network trouble to CLEC if no defect is found in AT&T-22STATE’s 911 network. The Parties agree that 911
network problem resolution will be managed expeditiously at all times.
4.2.12 CLEC will not turn up live traffic until successful testing of E911 Trunks is completed by both Parties.
4.2.13 Where required, CLEC will comply with Commission directives regarding 911 facility and/or 911 Trunking
requirements.
4.3 Database:
4.3.1 Once the 911 Interconnection between CLEC and all appropriate AT&T-22STATE E911 SR(s) has been
established and tested, CLEC or its representatives shall be responsible for providing CLEC's End User 911
Records to AT&T-22STATE for inclusion in AT&T-22STATE’s DBMS on a timely basis.
4.3.2 CLEC or its agent shall provide initial and ongoing updates of CLEC's End User 911 Records that are
Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) valid in electronic format based upon established NENA standards.
4.3.3 CLEC shall adopt use of a Company/NENA ID on all CLEC End User 911 Records in accordance with
NENA standards. The Company ID is used to identify the carrier of record in facility configurations.
4.3.4 CLEC is responsible for providing AT&T-22STATE updates to the E911 database; in addition, CLEC is
responsible for correcting any errors that may occur during the entry of their data to the AT&T-22STATE
911 DBMS.
5.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
5.1 For CLEC’s own switch(es), both Parties shall jointly coordinate the provisioning of transport capacity sufficient to
route originating E911 calls from CLEC’s POI to the designated AT&T-22STATE E911 SR(s).
5.1.1 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC will cooperate to promptly test all trunks and facilities between CLEC's network

1.0 Introduction
1.1 The following services are provided as Customer Information Services – Operator Services/Directory Assistance
(OS/DA), Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW), Directory Assistance Listings (DAL) and White Pages.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out OS
and DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-22STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches,
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-22STATE Retail OS/DA service, or
1.2.1.3 Leased Local Circuit Switching from AT&T-22STATE.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-22STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-22STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the Telephone Number, AT&T-22STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC is free to set its own retail OS/DA
rates, and CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility (a) to obtain End User agreement to
the OS/DA retail rates (i.e., by tariff or contract), and (b) to obtain any necessary regulatory
approvals for its OS/DA retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where technically feasible, AT&T-
22STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see Section 3.6
below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office” questions,
AT&T-22STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling Party’s inquiries to a CLEC-provided
contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Schedule based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider, and CLEC may convert facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice versa,
as described below in Section 3.6.8 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Schedule.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 INW:
1.3.1 This Attachment also sets forth terms and conditions for INW for Facility-Based CLECs.
1.3.2 Where technically feasible and available, the AT&T-22STATE INW operator will provide the Busy Line
Verification (BLV) service and Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I) service when reached by an operator
dialing the appropriate Toll Center Code in addition to the inward code.
1.4 DAL:
1.4.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for which CLEC agrees to purchase DAL information as
provided by AT&T-22STATE.

Attachment 06 – Customer Information Services/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
1.5 White Pages:
1.5.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to switched-based CLECs for subscriber listing
information in White Page directories provided by AT&T-22STATE owned ILEC and the CLEC.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “CLEC Subscriber” means CLEC End User, as End User is defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this
Agreement.
2.2 “General Assistance” means a service in which an operator calls the INW operator seeking assistance in dialing a
number. For example, the assistance could be required for attempting to dial a number where a ‘no ring’ condition
has been encountered.
2.3 “Busy Line Verification (BLV)” means a service in which an operator asks the INW operator to verify a conversation in
progress.
2.4 “Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I)” means a service in which an operator asks the INW operator to interrupt a
conversation in progress, to determine if one of the parties is willing to speak to the caller requesting the interrupt.
2.5 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit Access Tandem Code (ATC) code that uniquely identifies a tandem switch
in the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions. An
operator dials the appropriate area code + ATC + OPR SVC CODE to obtain INW.
2.6 “Operator Service Code (OPR SVC CODE)” means the operator dialable code assigned in the LERG for INW.
2.7 “Facilities-Based CLEC” – A CLEC that provides service through its own switch, a Third Party provider’s switch or via
local circuit switching leased from AT&T-22STATE via a stand-alone agreement.
3.0 Operator Services (OS) / Directory Services (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-22STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-22STATE’s OS and DA platforms with the same priority and
using the same methods as for AT&T-22STATE’s retail End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-22STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-22STATE retail End
Users served via that same AT&T-22STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This Section describes the Parties’ physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facility-Based
CLEC that wishes to interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the Point of
Interconnection (POI) for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum
must be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) within which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411,
1411, or 555-1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of
the End User dialing 0-, 0+, 411, 1411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical

Attachment 06 – Customer Information Services/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
billing address, regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the
OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-22STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for only OS, or only DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-22STATE Local Tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
22STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-22STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
22STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-22STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
22STATE End Offices to the AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-
Digit Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized,
and a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements:
3.3.6.1 OS Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
22STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group
will be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the
trunk group transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then
the group will be designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for
combined services. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASR’s on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2 DA/ DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch
to the AT&T-22STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk
group transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be
designated with the appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-13STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use
code and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.

Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together
on a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate
traffic use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose
of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.3 Busy Line Verification/Emergency Interrupt (BLV/EI) Trunks:
3.3.6.3.1 Where available, when CLEC wishes for AT&T-22STATE to perform Busy Line
Verification or Emergency Interrupt for CLEC End Users a segregated one-way
BLV trunk group with MF signaling from AT&T-22STATE’s Operator Services
switch to CLEC’s switch serving End Users in that LATA will be required. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way
trunk group. The BLV trunk group will be designated with the appropriate traffic
use code and modifier.
3.4 OS Offerings:
3.4.1 Operator Services Rate Structure:
3.4.1.1 AT&T-22STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is
receiving (a) manual OS (i.e., provided a live Operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch
equipment voice recognition feature, functioning either fully or partially without live Operators
where feasible). The Pricing Schedule contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring
rates.
3.4.2 Operator Services Call Processing:
3.4.2.1 Whether manual or automated, AT&T-22STATE will provide the following services when
processing a 0- or 0+ dialed call from CLEC’s line, regardless of whether DA is also requested:
3.4.2.1.1 General Assistance - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to
provide local and intraLATA dialing assistance for the purposes of completing calls,
or requesting information on how to place calls (e.g., handling emergency calls,
handling credits, etc.).
3.4.2.1.2 Calling Card - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, provides the OS Operator with a
Calling Card number for billing purposes, and seeks assistance in completing the
call.
3.4.2.1.3 Collect - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to bill the charges
associated with the call to the called number, provided such billing is accepted by
the called number.
3.4.2.1.4 Third Number Billed - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator to bill
the call to a different number than the calling or called number.
3.4.2.1.5 Person-To-Person Service - The End User dialing 0- or 0+, asks the OS Operator
for assistance in reaching a particular person or a particular PBX station,
department or office to be reached through a PBX attendant. This service applies
even if the caller agrees, after the connection is established, to speak to any party
other than the party previously specified.
3.4.2.1.6 Busy Line Verification - A service in which the End User dialing 0- asks the OS
Operator to check the requested line for conversation in progress and advise the
caller of the status.
3.4.2.1.7 Busy Line Interrupt - A service in which the End User dialing 0- asks the Operator
to interrupt a conversation in progress, to determine if one of the parties is willing to
speak to the caller requesting the interrupt.

3.5 DA Offerings:
3.5.1 DA Rate Structure:
3.5.1.1 AT&T-22STATE charges one rate for local DA, and a separate rate for all other DA products. In
both cases DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The
Pricing Schedule contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 DA Call Processing:
3.5.2.1 Where technically feasible and available, AT&T-22STATE will provide the following DA Services
when a CLEC End User served dials 411, 1-411, or 555-1212 regardless of whether CLEC also
requests OS from AT&T-22STATE:
3.5.2.1.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name, address and
telephone number to the dialing End User.
3.5.2.1.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an
intraLATA call to the requested number is completed on behalf of the DA End User,
utilizing an automated voice system or with operator assistance.
3.5.2.1.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request DA
outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.1.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - An Information Service consisting of
providing listed local and national name and address information associated with a
telephone number provided by the individual originating the call.
3.5.2.1.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - Where available, a service in which the End
User may request business telephone number listings for a specified category of
business, when the name of the business is not known. Telephone numbers may
be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 The incoming OS/DA call is automatically answered by a pre-recorded greeting loaded into the OS/DA
switch itself, prior to being handled by automated equipment or a live operator. CLEC may custom brand or
brand with silence.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-22STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC OnLine website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-22STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner.
CLEC will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.2 If CLEC does not wish to custom brand the OS/DA calls, CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting
with the OS/DA switch by having AT&T-22STATE load a recording of silence into the automatic, pre-
recorded announcement slot, set for the shortest possible duration allowed by the switch, to then be routed
to automated or live operators as with all other OS/DA calls, for which brand loading charges will still apply.
3.6.2.1 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary
mechanical handling of OS/DA calls.

Attachment 06 – Customer Information Services/AT&T-22STATE
Page 8 of 13
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
3.6.2.2 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-22STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to
identify the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.3 AT&T-22STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided recording or the silent announcement
into all applicable OS and/or DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at
parity with that provided to AT&T-22STATE retail End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial
recording or silent announcement loading charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any
subsequent loading charges if a new recordings or silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.4 Branding/Silent Announcement load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For
example, a CLEC Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facility-based operations,
and therefore two separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the Branding/Silent
Announcement charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing
Schedule.
3.6.5 Where Reference Rater is available, the applicable CLEC-charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided
contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office or repair call center) are loaded into the system
utilized by the OS/DA Operator.
3.6.6 Where Reference Rater is available, AT&T-22STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-provided
OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC-provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will be
responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.
3.6.7 Rate/Reference load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where Reference Rater is
available, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its facility-
based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
Rate/Reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing
Schedule.
3.6.8 Converting End Users from Prior Branded Service to CLEC or Silent-Branded Service, or between Resale
and facilities-based service:
3.6.8.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no Non-
Recurring Charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.8.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the Branding/Silent Announcement recording in
AT&T-22STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then Non-Recurring
Charges apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section
3.6 above, and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
4.0 Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW)
4.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.1.1 To the extent that CLEC elects to interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s operator assistance switches, the
CLEC’s responsibilities are described below.
4.1.2 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-22STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these INW facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-22STATE’s
intrastate Special Access Tariff.
4.1.3 The CLEC will initiate an ASR for a one-way trunk group from its designated operator assistance switch to
the AT&T-22STATE Operator assistance switch utilizing MF signaling.

Attachment 06 – Customer Information Services/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
4.2 CLEC will request in writing, thirty calendar (30) days in advance of the date when the INW are to be provided,
unless otherwise agreed to by AT&T-22STATE. CLEC or its designated OS providers shall submit an ASR to AT&T-
22STATE to establish any new interconnection trunking arrangements.
4.2.1 CLEC must provide one (1) Carrier Identification Code (CIC) for its CLEC or Incumbent Exchange Carrier
business operation and an additional CIC for its IXC business operation if the CLEC wishes to receive
separate billing data for its CLEC and IXC operations.
4.3 Specifics of INW Offering and Pricing:
4.3.1 Toll Center Codes will be used by the CLEC operators for routing and connecting to the AT&T-22STATE
Operator assistance switches. These codes are specific to the various AT&T-22STATE LATAs where
AT&T-22STATE Operator assistance switches are located.
4.3.2 AT&T-22STATE OS will require a Toll Center Code for the CLEC OS assistance switch. This code will be
the routing code used for connecting the AT&T-22STATE operator to the CLEC operator on an Inward
basis.
4.3.3 If the CLEC requires establishment of a new Toll Center Code, CLEC shall do so by referencing the LERG.
4.3.4 AT&T-22STATE pricing for INW shall be based on the rates specified in the Pricing Schedule.
4.4 If the CLEC terminates INW or OS/DA service prior to the expiration of the term of this Agreement, CLEC shall pay
AT&T-22STATE, within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of any bills by AT&T-22STATE, all amounts due for
actual services provided under this Attachment, plus estimated monthly charges for the remainder of the term.
Estimated charges will be based on an average of the actual monthly amounts billed by AT&T-22STATE pursuant to
this Attachment prior to its termination.
4.5 The rates applicable for determining the amount(s) under the terms outlined in this Section are those specified in the
Pricing Schedule.
5.0 Directory Assistance Listings (DAL)
5.1 Responsibilities of the Parties:
5.1.1 Where technically feasible and/or available, AT&T-22STATE will provide DAL information referred to as
Directory Assistance Listing (DAL) in AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE, Directory Assistance Listing
Information Service (DALIS) in AT&T CALIFORNIA, Dialing Parity Directory Listings (DPDL) in AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE, Dialing Parity List License (DPLL) in AT&T CONNECTICUT, Directory
Assistance List License (DALL) in AT&T NEVADA and Directory Assistance Database Services (DADS) in
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE (hereinafter collectively referred to as DAL).
5.1.2 AT&T-22STATE owns and maintains the database containing DAL information (name, address and
published telephone number, or an indication of "non-published status") of telephone service subscribers.
5.1.3 AT&T-22STATE uses the DAL information in its database to provide directory assistance (DA) service to
End Users who call AT&T-22STATE’s DA to obtain such information.
5.1.4 Inasmuch as AT&T-22STATE provides DA service under contract for ILECs and CLECs, AT&T-22STATE’s
database also contains DAL information of other ILEC and CLEC telephone service subscribers.
5.1.5 CLEC, or its agent, who choose to provide DA service to CLEC’s End Users located in the CLEC’s service
area may load its database with DAL contained in AT&T-22STATE’s DA database.
5.1.6 AT&T-22STATE agrees to license requested DAL information contained in its database, under the following
terms and conditions:

5.2.1 Use of DAL Information:
5.2.1.1 CLEC may use the DAL information licensed and provided pursuant to this Attachment in
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules including any subsequent decision by
the FCC or a court regarding the use of DAL.
5.2.1.2 In the event a telephone service subscriber has a “non-published” listing, a “non-published”
classification will be identified in lieu of the telephone number information and will be considered
part of the Listing Information. The last name, first name, street number, street name,
community, and zip code will be provided as part of the Listing Information when available. The
information provided for non-published telephone service subscribers can only be used for two
(2) purposes. First, the non-published status may be added to the listing in CLEC’s database for
the sole purpose of adding/correcting the non-published status of the listings in the database.
Second, addresses for non-published telephone service subscribers may be used for verification
of the non-published status of the listing. If a caller provides the address for a requested listing,
CLEC may verify the non-published status of the requested listing by matching the caller-
provided address with the address in CLEC’s database. CLEC however, may not provide the
address information of a requested listing of a non-published telephone service subscriber to a
caller under any circumstances, including when verifying the address. CLEC can notify the End
User that the requested listing is non-published.

and Conditions of this Agreement. CLEC provides local exchange telephone service in the same area(s)
and CLEC wishes to include listing information for its End Users located in AT&T-22STATE’s ILEC Territory
in the appropriate AT&T-22STATE White Pages directories.
6.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
6.2.1 Subject to AT&T-22STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
White Pages directories, AT&T-22STATE will include in appropriate White Pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the ILEC Territory. The rules, regulations and AT&T-
22STATE practices are subject to change from time to time. When CLEC provides its subscriber listing
information to AT&T-22STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End User, one primary listing in
AT&T-22STATE White Pages directory and a listing in AT&T-22STATE’s DA database at no charge, other
than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
6.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated
with the request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order
charge, as appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory
listing. Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to
port a number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in
AT&T-22STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic
service order charge, as appropriate.
6.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
6.2.1.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-22STATE affords its own directory listing information.
6.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
6.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-22STATE the names, addresses and telephone
numbers of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-
listed/Non-Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in the Pricing
Schedule.
6.2.1.4 Additional, Designer and Other Listings:
6.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires foreign, enhanced, designer or other listings in
addition to the primary listing to appear in the White Pages directory, AT&T-

6.2.2 CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-22STATE subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located
within the ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-22STATE may require to prepare
and print the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall refer to the AT&T CLEC OnLine website for
methods, procedures and ordering information.
6.2.3 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-22STATE via a
mechanical or manual feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-22STATE’s Directory Listing
database. CLEC agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of
the Effective Date of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates
per day, whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory
among AT&T-22STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1)
Business Day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or
non-published status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must
submit all listing information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
6.2.4 Through the normal course of business, End Users may notify AT&T-22STATE, or its publishing Affiliate, of
inaccurate or incomplete listing information. In such instance AT&T-22STATE, or its publishing Affiliate,
shall take appropriate action, as directed by the End User, to update the listing. AT&T-22STATE, or its
publishing Affiliate, shall also inform CLEC of the deficiency and direct CLEC to send a listing update with
the information necessary to make the End User Listing accurate and complete. CLEC shall respond within
five (5) Business Days to such direction from AT&T-22STATE, or its publishing Affiliate.
6.2.5 Distribution of Directories:
6.2.5.1 Each CLEC subscriber will receive one copy per primary End User listing, as provided by CLEC,
of AT&T-22STATE White Pages directory in the same manner, format and at the same time that
they are delivered to AT&T-22STATE’s subscribers during the annual delivery of newly
published directories.
6.2.5.1.1 AT&T CONNECTICUT White Page directories will be provided in accordance to
state and/or local regulations and orders governing White Page directory

6.2.5.2 AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to provide any additional White Page directories above the
directories provided to CLEC End Users as specified in Section 6.2.5.1 above.
6.2.5.3 CLEC may arrange for additional directory distribution and other services with AT&T-22STATE’s
directory publishing Affiliate pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by the publishing Affiliate
and CLEC.
6.2.6 AT&T-22STATE shall direct its directory publishing Affiliate to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the
“Information Pages”, or comparable section of its White Pages directories (covering the territory where
CLEC is certified to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair,
customer service and billing information. AT&T-22STATE’s directory publishing Affiliate will include such
CLEC information in the “Information Pages” pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by the publishing
Affiliate and CLEC.
6.2.7 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
6.2.7.1 AT&T-22STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact for all independent and Third
Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber (i.e., End User) listing
information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing information in the
same manner as AT&T-22STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange for AT&T-
22STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing information
equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-22STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber listing
information provided to AT&T-22STATE pursuant to this Attachment in AT&T-22STATE’s White
Pages directory, AT&T-22STATE’s DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber listing

information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings to
requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
22STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-22STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
6.2.7.2 AT&T-22STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact
with independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of
requests are fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to
directory publishers, CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-22STATE’s
receipt of the subscriber list information or for the subsequent release of this information to
directory publishers. Such CLEC subscriber list information shall be intermingled with AT&T-
22STATE’s subscriber list information and the subscriber list information of other companies that
have authorized a similar release of their subscriber list information by AT&T-22STATE.
6.2.8 CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE and/or its Affiliates as a result of CLEC
not complying with the terms of this Attachment.
6.2.9 This Attachment shall not establish, be interpreted as establishing, or be used by either Party to establish or
to represent their relationship as any form of agency, partnership or joint venture.
6.2.10 Breach of Contract:
6.2.10.1 If either Party is found to have materially breached the White Pages directory terms of this
Attachment, the non-breaching Party may terminate the White Pages directory terms of this
Attachment by providing written Notice to the breaching Party, whereupon this Attachment shall
be null and void with respect to any issue of AT&T-22STATE’s White Pages directory published
sixty (60) or more calendar days after the date of receipt of such written Notice. CLEC further
agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE and/or its Affiliates as a result of such CLEC
breach.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for nondiscriminatory access to Operations Support Systems (OSS)
“functions” to CLEC for pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance/repair, and billing provided by AT&T-
22STATE. CLEC represents and covenants that it will only use OSS furnished pursuant to this Agreement for
activities related to 251(c)(3) UNEs (as provided in Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs, resold services, or other
services covered by this Interconnection Agreement ICA Service(s)).
1.2 Should AT&T-22STATE no longer be obligated to provide a 251(c)(3) UNE or other ICA Service under the terms of
this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE shall no longer be obligated to offer access and use of OSS for that ICA Service.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Service Bureau Provider (SBP)” means a company which has been engaged by a CLEC to act on its behalf for
purposes of accessing AT&T-22STATE OSS application-to-application interfaces via a dedicated connection over
which multiple CLEC’s local service transactions are transported.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-22STATE’s OSS are comprised of systems and processes that are in some cases region-specific (hereinafter
referred to as “Regional OSS”). Regional OSS is available only in the regions where such systems and processes
are currently operational.
3.2 AT&T-22STATE will provide electronic access to OSS via web-based GUIs and application-to-application interfaces.
These GUIs and interfaces will allow CLEC to perform pre-order, order, provisioning, maintenance and repair
functions. AT&T-22STATE will follow industry guidelines and the Change Management Process (CMP) in the
development of these interfaces.
3.3 AT&T-22STATE will provide all relevant documentation (manuals, user guides, specifications, etc.) regarding
business rules and other formatting information, as well as practices and procedures, necessary to handle OSS
related requests. All relevant documentation will be readily accessible at AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
Documentation may be amended by AT&T-22STATE in its sole discretion from time to time. All Parties agree to
abide by the procedures contained in the then-current documentation.
3.4 AT&T-22STATE’s OSS are designed to accommodate requests for both current and projected demands of CLEC
and other CLECs in the aggregate.
3.5 CLEC shall advise AT&T-22STATE no less than seven (7) Business Days in advance of any anticipated ordering
volumes above CLEC’s normal average daily volumes.
3.6 It is the sole responsibility of CLEC to obtain the technical capability to access and utilize AT&T-22STATE’s OSS
interfaces. All hardware and software requirements for the applicable AT&T-22STATE Regional OSS are specified
on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.7 CLEC must access the AT&T-22STATE OSS interfaces as indicated in the connectivity specifications and methods
set forth on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
3.8 Prior to initial use of AT&T-22STATE’s Regional OSS, CLEC shall attend and participate in implementation meetings
to discuss CLEC access plans in detail and schedule testing.
3.9 The technical support function of electronic OSS interfaces can be accessed via the AT&T CLEC Online website.
CLEC will also provide a single point of contact for technical issues related to CLEC’s use of AT&T-22STATE’s
electronic interfaces.

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
3.11 AT&T-22STATE shall provide nondiscriminatory access to OSS processes. When OSS processes are not available
electronically, AT&T-22STATE shall make manual processes available.
3.12 The Parties agree that a collaborative CMP will be used to manage changes to existing interfaces, introduction of
new interfaces and retirement of interfaces. The CMP will cover changes to AT&T-22STATE’s electronic interfaces,
AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC testing environment, associated manual process improvements, and relevant
documentation. The process will define a procedure for resolution of CMP disputes.
3.13 Due to enhancements and on-going development of access to AT&T-22STATE CLEC OSS functions, certain
interfaces may be modified, may be temporarily unavailable, or may be phased out after execution of this Agreement.
AT&T-22STATE shall provide proper notice of interface phase-out in accordance with CMP.
3.14 The Parties agree to provide one another with toll-free contact numbers for the purpose of addressing ordering,
provisioning and maintenance of services issues. Contact numbers for maintenance/repair of services shall be
staffed twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.
3.15 Proper Use of OSS Interfaces
3.15.1 CLEC shall use AT&T-22STATE electronic interfaces, as described herein, exclusively for the purposes
specifically provided herein. In addition, CLEC agrees that such use will comply with AT&T-22STATE’s
Data Connection Security Requirements as identified in Section 9.0 below of this Attachment. Failure to
comply with the requirements of this Attachment, including such security guidelines, may result in forfeiture
of electronic access to OSS functionality. In addition, CLEC shall be responsible for and indemnifies AT&T-
22STATE against any cost, expense or liability relating to any unauthorized entry or access into, or use or
manipulation of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS from CLEC systems, workstations or terminals or by CLEC
employees, agents, or any Third Party gaining access through information and/or facilities obtained from or
utilized by CLEC and shall pay AT&T-22STATE for any and all damages caused by such unauthorized
entry.
3.15.2 CLEC’s access to pre-order functions will only be used to view Customer Proprietary Network Information
(CPNI) of another carrier’s End User where CLEC has obtained an authorization from the End User for
release of CPNI.
3.15.2.1 CLEC must maintain records of individual End Users’ authorizations for change in local
Exchange Service and release of CPNI which adhere to all requirements of state and federal
law, as applicable.
3.15.2.2 CLEC is solely responsible for determining whether proper authorization has been obtained and
holds AT&T-22STATE harmless from any loss on account of CLEC’s failure to obtain proper
CPNI consent from an End User. The Parties agree not to view, copy, or otherwise obtain
access to the customer record information about any other carriers’ End Users without proper
permission. CLEC will obtain access to End User customer record information only in strict
compliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations of the state in which the service is
provided.
3.15.3 AT&T-22STATE shall be free to connect an End User to any CLEC based upon that CLEC’s request and
that CLEC’s assurance that proper End User authorization has been obtained. CLEC shall make any such
authorization it has obtained available to AT&T-22STATE upon request and at no charge.
3.15.4 By using electronic interfaces to access OSS functions, CLEC agrees to perform accurate and correct
ordering of ICA Services. CLEC is also responsible for all actions of its employees using any of AT&T-
22STATE’s OSS. As such, CLEC agrees to accept and pay all reasonable costs or expenses, including
labor costs, incurred by AT&T-22STATE caused by any and all inaccurate ordering or usage of the OSS, if
such costs are not already recovered through other charges assessed by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC. In
addition, CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T-22STATE harmless against any claim made by an End
User of CLEC or Third Parties against AT&T-22STATE caused by or related to CLEC’s use of any AT&T-
22STATE OSS.

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
3.15.5 In the event AT&T-22STATE has good cause to believe that CLEC has used AT&T-22STATE OSS in a
way that conflicts with this Agreement or Applicable Law, AT&T-22STATE shall give CLEC written Notice
describing the alleged misuse (“Notice of Misuse”). CLEC shall immediately refrain from the alleged misuse
until such time that CLEC responds in writing to the Notice of Misuse, which CLEC shall provide to AT&T-
22STATE within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Misuse. In the event CLEC agrees
with the allegation of misuse, CLEC shall refrain from the alleged misuse during the term of this Agreement.
3.15.6 In the event CLEC does not respond to the Notice of Misuse or does not agree that the CLEC’s use of
AT&T-22STATE OSS is inconsistent with this Agreement or Applicable Law, then the Parties agree to the
following steps:
3.15.6.1 If such misuse involves improper access of pre-order applications or involves a violation of the
security guidelines contained herein, or negatively affects another OSS user’s ability to use OSS,
CLEC shall continue to refrain from using the particular OSS functionality in the manner alleged
by AT&T-22STATE to be improper, until CLEC has implemented a mutually agreeable remedy
to the alleged misuse.
3.15.6.2 To remedy the misuse for the balance of the Agreement, the Parties will work together as
necessary to mutually determine a permanent resolution for the balance of the term of the
Agreement.
3.16 In order to determine whether CLEC has engaged in the alleged misuse described in the Notice of Misuse, AT&T-
22STATE shall have the right to conduct an audit of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-22STATE OSS. Such audit shall be
limited to auditing those aspects of CLEC’s use of the AT&T-22STATE OSS that relate to the allegation of misuse as
set forth in the Notice of Misuse. AT&T-22STATE shall give ten (10) calendar days advance written Notice of its
intent to audit CLEC (“Audit Notice”) under this Section, and shall identify the type of information needed for the audit.
Such Audit Notice may not precede the Notice of Misuse. Within a reasonable time following the Audit Notice, but no
less than fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of the Audit Notice (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties),
CLEC shall provide AT&T-22STATE with access to the requested information in any reasonably requested format, at
an appropriate CLEC location, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. The audit shall be at AT&T-22STATE’s
expense. All information obtained through such an audit shall be deemed proprietary and/or confidential and subject
to confidential treatment without necessity for marking such information confidential. AT&T-22STATE agrees that it
shall only use employees or outside parties to conduct the audit who do not have marketing, strategic analysis,
competitive assessment or similar responsibilities within AT&T-22STATE. If CLEC fails to cooperate in the audit,
AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to terminate CLEC’s access to electronic processes.
4.0 Pre-Ordering
4.1 AT&T-22STATE Regional OSS are available in order that CLEC can perform the pre-ordering functions for ICA
Services, including but not limited to:
4.1.1 Service address validation
4.1.2 Telephone number selection

after requested via electronic access where available. If electronic access is not available, CLEC shall provide to
AT&T-22STATE paper copies of End User record information, including circuit numbers associated with each

Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems/AT&T-22STATE
Page 6 of 13
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
telephone number where applicable. CLEC shall provide such End User service records within twenty-four (24)
hours of a valid request, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
4.4 Data validation files provided are described on the AT&T CLEC Online website. These files provide an alternate
method of acquiring pre-ordering information that is considered relatively static and are available via the pre-order
GUI, AT&T’s CLEC Online website, or other distribution methods.
5.0 Ordering
5.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide ordering functionality. To order any ICA Services CLEC will format a Local Service
Request (LSR) to identify the features, services or elements CLEC is requesting AT&T-22STATE to provision in
accordance with applicable AT&T-22STATE ordering requirements and other terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Ordering requirements are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.2 In ordering and provisioning, Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT) and local Interconnection trunks, CLEC and
AT&T-22STATE will use industry Access Service Request (ASR) guidelines, based upon AT&T-22STATE ordering
requirements. AT&T-22STATE’s ASR guidelines are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.3 AT&T-22STATE product/service intervals are located on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
5.4 AT&T-22STATE shall return a Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) in accordance with the applicable performance
intervals. CLEC shall provide to AT&T-22STATE an FOC per the guidelines located on AT&T’s CLEC Online
website.
5.5 When an AT&T-22STATE provided ICA Service is replaced by CLEC’s facility-based service using any AT&T-
22STATE provided ICA Services, CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests, to both disconnect the existing
service and order ICA Services. These requests will be processed by AT&T-22STATE, and CLEC will be charged
the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each individual ICA
Service and cross-connect ordered. Similarly, when an End User is served by one CLEC using AT&T-22STATE
provided ICA Services is converted to another CLEC’s service using any AT&T-22STATE provided ICA Services, the
requesting CLEC shall issue appropriate service requests to both disconnect the existing service and connect new
service to the requesting CLEC End User. These requests will be processed by AT&T-22STATE and the CLEC will
be charged the applicable service order charge(s), in addition to the recurring and nonrecurring charges for each
individual ICA Service and cross-connect ordered.
5.6 AT&T-22STATE shall bill to CLEC an LSR charge and/or appropriate service order charges based on the manner in
which the order is submitted (e.g. manually, semi-mechanized, mechanized) at the rate set forth in the applicable
Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides to this Agreement for each LSR submitted. An
individual LSR will be identified for billing purposes by its Purchase Order Number (PON).
5.7 The Commissions, in some states, have ordered per element manual additive nonrecurring charges for ICA Services
ordered by means other than one of the interactive interfaces (“Additional Charges”). Additional Charges shall
charges will apply in these states as set forth in the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or
service guides.
6.0 Provisioning
6.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory provisioning of ICA Services. Access to order status and
provisioning order status is available via the regional pre-ordering and ordering GUIs, AT&T’s CLEC Online website,
and application-to-application interfaces.
6.2 AT&T-22STATE shall provision services during its regular working hours. To the extent CLEC requests provisioning
of service to be performed outside AT&T-22STATE’s regular working hours, or the work so requested requires
AT&T-22STATE’s technicians or project managers to work outside of regular working hours, AT&T-22STATE will
assess overtime charges set forth in the Pricing Schedule/AT&T-22STATE’s intrastate Access Services Tariff.
6.3 In the event AT&T-22STATE must dispatch to the End User’s location more than once for provisioning of ICA
Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect contact

Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems/AT&T-22STATE
Page 7 of 13
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
name/number, etc.), AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to provision the circuit due
to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-22STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges from the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or applicable tariffs, price list or service guides.
6.4 Cancellation Charges:
6.4.1 If CLEC cancels an order for ICA Services subsequent to AT&T-22STATE’s generation of a service order,
any costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE in conjunction with provisioning of services as requested on the
cancelled LSR will be recovered in accordance with the cancellation methodology set forth in the
Cancellation Charge Percentage Chart found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website. In addition, AT&T-
22STATE reserves the right to assess cancellation charges if CLEC fails to respond within nine (9)
Business Days to a Missed Appointment order notification.
6.4.1.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CLEC places an LSR based upon AT&T-22STATE’s loop
makeup information, and such information is inaccurate resulting in the inability of AT&T-
22STATE to provision the ICA Services requested and another spare compatible facility cannot
be found with the transmission characteristics of the ICA Services originally requested,
cancellation charges shall not apply. Where CLEC places a single LSR for multiple ICA Services
based upon loop makeup information, and information as to some, but not all, of the ICA
Services is inaccurate, if AT&T-22STATE cannot provision the ICA Services that were the
subject of the inaccurate loop makeup information, CLEC may cancel its request for those ICA
Services without incurring cancellation charges. In such instance, should CLEC elect to cancel
the entire LSR, cancellation charges as shall apply to those ICA Services that were not the
subject of inaccurate loop makeup.
6.5 Expedite Charges:
6.5.1 For Expedite requests by CLEC, charges from the Pricing Schedule or Connecticut Access Service Tariff
will apply for intervals less than the standard interval as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
6.6 Order Modification Charges:
6.6.1 If CLEC modifies an order after being sent a FOC from AT&T-22STATE, the Order Modification Charge
(OMC) or Order Modification Charge Additional Dispatch (OMCAD) will be accessed from the Pricing
Schedule as applicable.
7.0 Maintenance/Repair
7.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC with access to electronic interfaces for the purpose of reporting and monitoring
trouble.
7.2 The methods and procedures for trouble reporting outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website shall be used.
7.3 AT&T-22STATE will maintain, repair and/or replace ICA Services in accordance with the FCC requirements and
applicable tariffs.
7.4 CLEC shall make available at mutually agreeable times the 251(c)(3) UNEs provided pursuant to this Agreement in
order to permit AT&T-22STATE to test and make adjustments appropriate for maintaining the 251(c)(3) UNEs in
satisfactory operating condition. No credit will be allowed for any interruptions involved during such testing and
adjustments.
7.5 Neither CLEC or its End Users shall rearrange, move, disconnect, remove or attempt to repair any facilities owned by
AT&T-22STATE except with the prior written consent of AT&T-22STATE.
7.6 CLEC will be responsible for testing and isolating troubles on ICA Services. CLEC must test and isolate trouble to
the AT&T-22STATE network before reporting the trouble to the Maintenance Center. Upon request from AT&T-
22STATE at the time of the trouble report, CLEC will be required to provide the results of the CLEC test isolating the
trouble to the AT&T-22STATE network.

7.7 For all ICA Services repair requests, CLEC shall adhere to AT&T-22STATE’s prescreening guidelines prior to
referring the trouble to AT&T-22STATE.
7.8 CLEC will contact the appropriate AT&T-22STATE repair centers in accordance with procedures established by
AT&T-22STATE.
7.9 AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to contact CLEC’s End Users, if deemed necessary, for provisioning or
maintenance purposes.
7.10 Repair requests are billed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If CLEC reports a trouble on a
AT&T-22STATE ICA Service and no trouble is found in AT&T-22STATE’s network, AT&T-22STATE will charge
CLEC a Maintenance of Service Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material
Charges/Additional Labor Charges for any dispatching and testing (both inside and outside the Central Office)
required by AT&T-22STATE in order to confirm the working status. AT&T-22STATE will assess these charges at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule and/or applicable tariffs.
7.11 In the event AT&T-22STATE must dispatch to an End User’s location more than once for repair or maintenance of
ICA Services due to incorrect or incomplete information provided by CLEC (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect
contact name/number, etc.), AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for each additional dispatch required to repair the circuit
due to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T-22STATE will assess the Maintenance of Service
Charge/Trouble Determination Charge/Trouble Location Charge/Time and Material Charges/Additional Labor
Charges at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
7.12 CLEC shall pay Time and Material charges when AT&T-22STATE dispatches personnel and the trouble is in
equipment or communications systems provided an entity by other than AT&T-22STATE or in detariffed CPE
provided by AT&T-22STATE, unless covered under a separate maintenance agreement.
7.13 CLEC shall pay Maintenance of Service charges when the trouble clearance did not otherwise require dispatch, but
dispatch was requested for repair verification or cooperative testing, and the circuit did not exceed maintenance
limits.
7.14 If CLEC issues a trouble report allowing AT&T-22STATE access to End User's premises and AT&T-22STATE
personnel are dispatched but denied access to the premises, then Time and Material charges will apply for the period
of time that AT&T-22STATE personnel are dispatched. Subsequently, if AT&T-22STATE personnel are allowed
access to the premises, these charges will still apply.
7.15 Time and Material charges apply on a first and additional basis for each half-hour or fraction thereof. If more than
one technician is dispatched in conjunction with the same trouble report, the total time for all technicians dispatched
will be aggregated prior to the distribution of time between the “First Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” and “Each
Additional Half Hour or Fraction Thereof” rate categories. Basic Time is work-related efforts of AT&T-22STATE
performed during normally scheduled working hours on a normally scheduled workday. Overtime is work-related
efforts of AT&T-22STATE performed on a normally scheduled workday, but outside of normally scheduled working
hours. Premium Time is work related efforts of AT&T-22STATE performed other than on a normally scheduled
workday.
7.15.1 If CLEC requests or approves an AT&T-22STATE technician to perform services in excess of or not
otherwise contemplated by the nonrecurring charges herein, CLEC will pay Time and Material charges for
any additional work to perform such services, including requests for installation or other work outside of
normally scheduled working hours.
8.0 Billing
8.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide to CLEC nondiscriminatory access to associated billing information as necessary to
allow CLEC to perform billing functions.
8.1.1 The charges for bill data are dependent upon the manner in which such bill data is delivered to CLEC.

8.1.1.1 CLEC agrees to pay the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule, Tariff, or Guidebook,
as applicable
8.1.1.2 When a CLEC elects to receive its monthly billing statements in more than one bill media format
paper media shall be the primary media source and any other media formats shall be secondary
media subject to the rates, terms and conditions contained in the Pricing Schedule, Tariff, or
Guidebook, as applicable.
9.0 Data Connection Security Requirements
9.1 CLEC agrees to comply with AT&T-22STATE data connection security procedures, including but not limited to
procedures on joint security requirements, information security, user identification and authentication, network
monitoring, and software integrity. These procedures are set forth on the AT&TCLEC Online website.
9.2 CLEC agrees that interconnection of CLEC data facilities with AT&T-22STATE data facilities for access to OSS will
be in compliance with AT&T-22STATE’s “Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) Operations Support System
Interconnection Procedures” document current at the time of initial connection to AT&T-22STATE and available on
the AT&T CLEC Online website.
9.3 Joint Security Requirements:
9.3.1 Both Parties will maintain accurate and auditable records that monitor user authentication and machine
integrity and confidentiality (e.g., password assignment and aging, chronological logs configured, system
accounting data, etc.).
9.3.2 Both Parties shall maintain accurate and complete records detailing the individual data connections and
systems to which they have granted the other Party access or interface privileges. These records will
include, but are not limited to, user ID assignment, user request records, system configuration, time limits of
user access or system interfaces. These records should be kept until the termination of this Agreement or
the termination of the requested access by the identified individual. Either Party may initiate a compliance
review of the connection records to verify that only the agreed to connections are in place and that the
connection records are accurate.
9.3.3 CLEC shall immediately notify AT&T-22STATE when an employee user ID is no longer valid (e.g. employee
termination or movement to another department).
9.3.4 The Parties shall use an industry standard virus detection software program at all times. The Parties shall
immediately advise each other by telephone upon actual knowledge that a virus or other malicious code has
been transmitted to the other Party.
9.3.5 All physical access to equipment and services required to transmit data will be in secured locations.
Verification of authorization will be required for access to all such secured locations. A secured location is
where walls and doors are constructed and arranged to serve as barriers and to provide uniform protection
for all equipment used in the data connections which are made as a result of the user’s access to either the
CLEC’s or AT&T-22STATE’s network. At a minimum, this shall include access doors equipped with card
reader control or an equivalent authentication procedure and/or device, and egress doors which generate a
real-time alarm when opened and which are equipped with tamper resistant and panic hardware as required
to meet building and safety standards.

or transferred.
9.4.3 Each Party shall notify the other Party’s security organization immediately upon initial discovery of actual or
suspected unauthorized access to, misuse of, or other “at risk” conditions regarding the identified data
facilities or information. Each Party shall provide a specified point of contact. If either Party suspects
unauthorized or inappropriate access, the Parties shall work together to isolate and resolve the problem.
9.4.4 In the event that one (1) Party identifies inconsistencies or lapses in the other Party’s adherence to the
security provisions described herein, or a discrepancy is found, documented, and delivered to the non-
complying Party, a corrective action plan to address the identified vulnerabilities must be provided by the
non-complying Party within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the identified inconsistency. The
corrective action plan must identify what will be done, the Party accountable/responsible, and the proposed
compliance date. The non-complying Party must provide periodic status reports (minimally monthly) to the
other Party's security organization on the implementation of the corrective action plan in order to track the
work to completion.
9.4.5 In the event there are technological constraints or situations where either Party’s corporate security
requirements cannot be met, the Parties will institute mutually agreed upon alternative security controls and
safeguards to mitigate risks.
9.4.6 All network-related problems will be managed to resolution by the respective organizations, CLEC or AT&T-
22STATE, as appropriate to the ownership of a failed component. As necessary, CLEC and AT&T-
22STATE will work together to resolve problems where the responsibility of either Party is not easily
identified.
9.5 Information Security Policies And Guidelines For Access To Computers, Networks and Information By Non-Employee
Personnel:
9.5.1 Information security policies and guidelines are designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and
availability of computer, networks and information resources. Section 9.6 below through Section 9.12 below
inclusive summarizes the general policies and principles for individuals who are not employees of the Party
that provides the computer, network or information, but have authorized access to that Party’s systems,
networks or information. Questions should be referred to CLEC or AT&T-22STATE, respectively, as the
providers of the computer, network or information in question.
9.5.2 It is each Party’s responsibility to notify its employees, contractors and vendors who will have access to the
other Party’s network, on the proper security responsibilities identified within this Attachment. Adherence to
these policies is a requirement for continued access to the other Party’s systems, networks or information.
Exceptions to the policies must be requested in writing and approved by the other Party’s information
security organization.
9.6 General Policies:
9.6.1 Each Party’s resources are for approved this Agreement’s business purposes only.
9.6.2 Each Party may exercise at any time its right to inspect, record, and/or remove all information contained in
its systems, and take appropriate action should unauthorized or improper usage be discovered.

Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems/AT&T-22STATE
Page 11 of 13
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
9.6.3 Individuals will only be given access to resources that they are authorized to receive and which they need to
perform their job duties. Users must not attempt to access resources for which they are not authorized.
9.6.4 Authorized users shall not develop, copy or use any program or code which circumvents or bypasses
system security or privilege mechanism or distorts accountability or audit mechanisms.
9.6.5 Actual or suspected unauthorized access events must be reported immediately to each Party’s security
organization or to an alternate contact identified by that Party. Each Party shall provide its respective
security contact information to the other.
9.7 User Identification:
9.7.1 Access to each Party’s corporate resources will be based on identifying and authenticating individual users
in order to maintain clear and personal accountability for each user’s actions.
9.7.2 User identification shall be accomplished by the assignment of a unique, permanent user ID, and each user
ID shall have an associated identification number for security purposes.
9.7.3 User IDs will be revalidated on a monthly basis.
9.8 User Authentication:
9.8.1 Users will usually be authenticated by use of a password. Strong authentication methods (e.g. one-time
passwords, digital signatures, etc.) may be required in the future.
9.8.2 Passwords must not be stored in script files.
9.8.3 Passwords must be entered by the user.
9.8.4 Passwords must be at least six (6) to eight (8) characters in length, not blank or a repeat of the user ID;
contain at least one (1) letter, and at least one (1) number or special character must be in a position other
than the first or last position. This format will ensure that the password is hard to guess. Most systems are
capable of being configured to automatically enforce these requirements. Where a system does not
mechanically require this format, the users must manually follow the format.
9.8.5 Systems will require users to change their passwords regularly (usually every thirty-one (31) days).
9.8.6 Systems are to be configured to prevent users from reusing the same password for six (6) changes/months.
9.8.7 Personal passwords must not be shared. Any user who has shared his password is responsible for any use
made of the password.
9.9 Access and Session Control:
9.9.1 Destination restrictions will be enforced at remote access facilities used for access to OSS Interfaces.
These connections must be approved by each Party’s corporate security organization.
9.9.2 Terminals or other input devices must not be left unattended while they may be used for system access.
Upon completion of each work session, terminals or workstations must be properly logged off.
9.10 User Authorization:
9.10.1 On the destination system, users are granted access to specific resources (e.g. databases, files,
transactions, etc.). These permissions will usually be defined for an individual user (or user group) when a
user ID is approved for access to the system.
9.11 Software and Data Integrity:
9.11.1 Each Party shall use a comparable degree of care to protect the other Party’s software and data from
unauthorized access, additions, changes and deletions as it uses to protect its own similar software and
data. This may be accomplished by physical security at the work location and by access control software on
the workstation.

Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
9.11.2 All software or data shall be scanned for viruses before use on a Party’s corporate facilities that can be
accessed through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS interfaces.
9.11.3 Unauthorized use of copyrighted software is prohibited on each Party’s corporate systems that can be
accessed through the direct connection or dial up access to OSS Interfaces.
9.11.4 Proprietary software or information (whether electronic or paper) of a Party shall not be given by the other
Party to unauthorized individuals. When it is no longer needed, each Party’s proprietary software or
information shall be returned by the other Party or disposed of securely. Paper copies shall be shredded.
Electronic copies shall be overwritten or degaussed.
9.12 Monitoring and Audit:
9.12.1 To deter unauthorized access events, a warning or no trespassing message will be displayed at the point of
initial entry (i.e., network entry or applications with direct entry points). Each Party should have several
approved versions of this message. Users should expect to see a warning message similar to this one:
“This is a(n) (AT&T or CLEC) system restricted to Company official business and subject
to being monitored at any time. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such
monitoring and to any evidence of unauthorized access, use, or modification being used
for criminal prosecution.”
9.12.2 After successful authentication, each session will display the last logon date/time and the number of
unsuccessful logon attempts. The user is responsible for reporting discrepancies.
10.0 Miscellaneous
10.1 To the extent AT&T-22STATE seeks to recover costs associated with OSS system access and connectivity, AT&T-
22STATE shall not be foreclosed from seeking recovery of such costs via negotiation, arbitration, or generic
proceeding during the term of this Agreement.
10.2 Unless otherwise specified herein, charges for the use of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS, and other charges applicable to
pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning and maintenance and repair, shall be at the applicable rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule.
10.3 Single Point of Contact:
10.3.1 CLEC will be the single point of contact with AT&T-22STATE for ordering activity for ICA Services used by
CLEC to provide services to its End Users, except that AT&T-22STATE may accept a request directly from
another CLEC, or AT&T-22STATE, acting with authorization of the affected End User. Pursuant to a
request from another carrier, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect any ICA Service being used by CLEC to
provide service to that End User and may reuse such network elements or facilities to enable such other
carrier to provide service to the End User. AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been
processed but will not be required to notify CLEC in advance of such processing.
10.4 Use of Facilities:
10.4.1 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another LEC, including
AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as ICA Services, and regardless of whether the End User served
with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or otherwise.
AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
10.5 AT&T-22STATE will provide loss notifications to CLEC. This notification alerts CLEC that a change requested by
another Telecommunications provider has/or may result in a change in the Local Service Provider associated with a
given telephone number. It will be provided via the ordering GUI and application-to-application interfaces and
AT&T’s CLEC Online website, as applicable.

11.0 Service Bureau Provider Arrangements for Shared Access to OSS
11.1 Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement regarding access to OSS to the contrary, CLEC shall be permitted
to access AT&T-22STATE OSS via a Service Bureau Provider as follows:
11.1.1 CLEC shall be permitted to access AT&T-22STATE application-to-application OSS interfaces, via a Service
Bureau Provider where CLEC has entered into an agency relationship with such Service Bureau Provider,
and the Service Bureau Provider has executed an Agreement with AT&T-22STATE to allow Service Bureau
Provider to establish access to and use of AT&T-22STATE’s OSS.
11.1.2 CLEC’s use of a Service Bureau Provider shall not relieve CLEC of the obligation to abide by all terms and
conditions of this Agreement. CLEC must ensure that its agent properly performs all OSS obligations of
CLEC under this Agreement, which CLEC delegates to Service Bureau Provider.
11.1.3 It shall be the obligation of CLEC to provide Notice in accordance with the Notice provisions of the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement whenever it establishes an agency relationship with a Service
Bureau Provider or terminates such a relationship. AT&T-22STATE shall have a reasonable transition time
to establish a connection to a Service Bureau Provider once CLEC provides Notice. Additionally, AT&T-
22STATE shall have a reasonable transition period to terminate any such connection after Notice from
CLEC that it has terminated its agency relationship with a Service Bureau Provider.
11.2 AT&T-22STATE shall not be obligated to pay liquidated damages or assessments for noncompliance with a
performance measurement to the extent that such noncompliance was the result of actions or events beyond AT&T-
22STATE’s control associated with Third Party systems or equipment including systems, equipment and services
provided by a Service Bureau Provider (acting as CLEC’s agent for connection to AT&T-22STATE’s OSS) which
could not be avoided by AT&T-22STATE through the exercise of reasonable diligence or delays or other problems
resulting from actions of a Service Bureau Provider, including Service Bureau provided processes, services, systems
or connectivity.

Page 3 of 4
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
1.0 Introduction
1.1 The Parties agree that CLEC is entitled to order any Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be made available
by FCC requirements pursuant to the Act. A Bona Fide Request (BFR) is to be used when CLEC makes a request of
AT&T-22STATE to provide a new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element that is not currently offered by AT&T-
22STATE but is required to be made available via the Act.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “BFR” means a Bona Fide Request pursuant to the Act.
2.2 “Complex Request Evaluation Fee” means an Individual Case Basis (ICB) fee to compensate AT&T-22STATE for
the extraordinary expenses directly related to the CLEC’s BFR which is a complex request that requires the allocation
and engagement of additional resources above the existing allocated resources used on BFR cost development
which include, but are not limited to, expenditure of funds to develop feasibility studies, specific resources that are
required to determine request requirements (such as operation support system analysts, technical managers,
software developers), software impact analysis by specific software developers; software architecture development,
hardware impact analysis by specific system analysts, etc.
2.3 “Development Rate” means the estimated cost for AT&T-22STATE to develop the new or modified 251(c)(3) element
and other network elements.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 A BFR shall be submitted by CLEC on the BFR Application Form, located on the AT&T CLEC Online website to their
designated AT&T-22STATE Senior Carrier Accounts Manager (SrCAM) and shall specifically identify the requested
service date, technical requirements, and/or such other specifications that clearly define the request such that AT&T-
22STATE has sufficient information to analyze and prepare a response. Such a request shall also include CLEC’s
designation of the BFR being pursuant to the Act.
3.1.1 CLEC shall include with its BFR Application Form a “BFR Deposit” to cover preliminary evaluation costs.
See Pricing Schedule for the BFR Deposit amount.
3.1.2 If the BFR Deposit amount identified in the Pricing Schedule is not made at the time of the BFR Application,
CLEC shall be responsible for all preliminary evaluation costs incurred by AT&T-22STATE to complete the
preliminary analysis (regardless of whether such costs are greater or lesser than the BFR Deposit amount in
the Pricing Schedule).
3.1.3 If CLEC submits a BFR Deposit with its BFR, and AT&T-22STATE is not able to process the request or
determines that the request does not qualify for BFR treatment, then AT&T-22STATE will credit the BFR
Deposit amount to the CLEC’s account. Similarly, if the costs incurred to complete the Preliminary Analysis
are less than the BFR Deposit, the balance of the deposit will, at the option of CLEC, either be credited
toward the CLEC’s account or credited toward any additional developmental costs authorized by CLEC.
3.2 Within two (2) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of a fully complete and valid BFR, AT&T-22STATE shall
acknowledge, in writing, its receipt and identify a single point of contact responsible for responding to the BFR and
shall request any additional information needed to process the BFR to the extent known at that time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T-22STATE may reasonably request additional information from CLEC at any
time during the processing of the BFR.
3.3 For any new or modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element required to be unbundled by Act, if AT&T-22STATE
determines that the preliminary analysis of the requested BFR is of such complexity that it will cause AT&T-
22STATE to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR, AT&T-22STATE shall notify CLEC within ten (10)
Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of the BFR that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee will be required prior
to the preliminary analysis of the BFR being performed by AT&T-22STATE. If CLEC accepts the Complex Request
Evaluation Fee proposed by AT&T-22STATE, CLEC shall submit such fee within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-
22STATE’s notice that a Complex Request Evaluation Fee is required. AT&T-22STATE will not be obligated to
further process the BFR until such Complex Request Evaluation Fee is received by AT&T-22STATE. Within thirty

Attachment 08 - Bona Fide Request/AT&T-22STATE
Page 4 of 4
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
(30) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, AT&T-22STATE shall
respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis.
3.4 If AT&T-22STATE is not required to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR as described in Section 3.3
above, then within thirty (30) Business Days of AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s fully complete and valid BFR,
AT&T-22STATE shall respond to CLEC by providing a preliminary analysis of the new or modified Section 251 or
251(c)(3) element. The preliminary analysis shall confirm either that AT&T-22STATE will or will not offer the new or
modified Section 251 or 251(c)(3) element.
3.5 CLEC may cancel a BFR at any time up until thirty (30) Business Days after receiving AT&T-22STATE’s preliminary
analysis. If CLEC cancels the BFR within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of AT&T-22STATE’s preliminary
analysis, AT&T-22STATE shall be entitled to retain the BFR Deposit or any Complex Request Evaluation Fee, minus
those costs that have not been incurred by AT&T-22STATE as of the date of cancellation.
3.6 CLEC will have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the preliminary analysis to accept the preliminary analysis.
CLEC must provide acceptance of the preliminary analysis in writing and provide the payment of the estimated
Development Rate for the new or modified network element quoted in the preliminary analysis. If CLEC fails to
respond within this thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR will be deemed cancelled.
3.7 As soon as feasible, but not more than ninety (90) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s receipt of CLEC’s written
acceptance of the preliminary analysis and payment of the estimated Development Rate, AT&T-22STATE shall
provide to CLEC a firm price quote. The firm price quote will include any additional Development Rates, the
nonrecurring rate and the recurring rate, and a detailed implementation plan. The firm nonrecurring rate will not
include any of the Development Rate or the Complex Request Evaluation Fee, if required, in the calculation of this
rate.
3.8 CLEC shall have thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of the firm price quote to accept or deny the firm price quote
in writing and submit any additional Development Rates or nonrecurring rates quoted in the firm price quote. If
AT&T-22STATE does not receive Notice of any of the foregoing within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the BFR
shall be deemed canceled. CLEC shall be responsible to reimburse AT&T-22STATE for its costs incurred up to the
date of cancellation (whether affirmatively canceled or deemed canceled by AT&T-22STATE).
3.9 Unless CLEC agrees otherwise, all prices shall be consistent with the applicable pricing principles and provisions of
the Act.
3.10 If CLEC believes that AT&T-22STATE’s firm price quote is not consistent with the requirements of the Act, either
Party may seek dispute resolution in accordance with the Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
3.11 Upon agreement to the rates, terms and conditions of the BFR, an amendment to this Agreement may be required
and the Parties shall negotiate such amendment in good faith.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
1.0 General Provisions
1.1 The Performance Measurements Plans referenced herein, notwithstanding any provisions in any other attachment in
this Agreement, are not intended to create, modify or otherwise affect Parties’ rights and obligations. The existence
of any particular performance measure, or the language describing that measure, is not evidence that CLEC is
entitled to any particular manner of access, nor is it evidence that AT&T-22STATE is limited to providing any
particular manner of access. The Parties’ rights and obligations to such access are defined elsewhere, including the
relevant laws, FCC and Commission decisions/regulations, and in the case of Connecticut, state tariffs, and within
this Agreement.
1.2 AT&T-22STATE’s implementation of the Performance Measurements Plans addressed by this Attachment
(Performance Measurement Plan(s), the Plan(s)) will not be considered as an admission against interest or an
admission of liability in any legal, regulatory, or other proceeding relating to the same performance. The Parties
agree that CLEC may not use the existence of such Plans as evidence that AT&T-22STATE has discriminated in the
provision of any facilities or services under Sections 251 or 252, or has violated any state or federal law or regulation.
AT&T-22STATE’s conduct underlying its performance, and the performance data provided under the Performance
Measurements Plans, however, are not made inadmissible by these terms. AT&T-22STATE’s performance as
measured by these plans may not be used as an admission of liability or culpability for a violation of any state or

messages due to the use of ported numbers, such sub-processing will be the responsibility of the porting entity.
8.0 CH Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions

Records to each participating LEC and CLEC. These reports list the:

revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable
to it for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports
or performing any other act under this Attachment.
9.3 AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE will not be liable for any losses or damages arising out of errors,
interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those
arising from associated equipment and data processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole
negligence of AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE is held liable under this Attachment for CH will in no event exceed the amount of processing
charges incurred by CLEC for the services provided hereunder during the period beginning at the time AT&T
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE receives notice of the error, interruption, defect, failure or malfunction, to the time
service is restored.
9.4 CLEC agrees to indemnify and hold AT&T SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE harmless against and with respect to

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions under which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will perform the revenue settlement of LEC-carried intrastate/intraLATA or
interstate/intraLATA local/toll alternately billed calls between each of the aforementioned regions and the CLEC via
the Centralized Message Distribution System (CMDS) Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS) reports.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Non-Intercompany Settlement (NICS)” means a revenue settlement process for messages which originate from
CLEC and bill to AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and messages
which originate from AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and bill to
CLEC. NICS messages must originate and bill within the same AT&T-Owned ILEC across the fourteen (14)
individual states which make up these two regions.
2.2 “Non-Intercompany Settlements System” or “NICS System” means the national system administered by Telcordia
that is used in the settlement of revenues for calls that are originated and billed by two (2) different Local Exchange
Carriers (LECs) within a single CMDS Direct Participant’s territory to another for billing. NICS applies to calls
involving another LEC where the Earning Company and the Billing Company are located within both AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 NICS shall apply only to alternately billed messages (calling card, third number billed and collect calls) originated by
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE billed by CLEC (when the CLEC is
using its own End Office Switch),or messages originated by CLEC and billed by AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE
and AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE within the same AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE State (i.e., messages for intrastate/intraLATA traffic only).
3.1.1 For example, an alternately billed call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS territory and billed to a CLEC within
AT&T-ILLINOIS would be covered by this section; a call originating within AT&T-ILLINOIS but billing
outside of AT&T-ILLINOIS would not be covered by NICS.
3.2 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also collect the revenue earned by CLEC within the AT&T SOUTHEAST
REGION 9-STATE territory from another LEC also within the AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE where the
messages are billed, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing Schedule, on behalf of
CLEC. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will remit the revenue billed by CLEC within region to the LEC also
within region, where the messages originated, less a per message billing and collection fee indicated in the Pricing
Schedule. These two amounts will be netted together by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and the resulting
charge or credit issued to CLEC via a monthly invoice in arrears.
3.3 NICS does not extend to 900 or 976 calls or to other pay per call services.
3.4 The Telcordia Technologies NICS report is the source for revenue to be settled between AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE and CLEC. NICS settlement will be incorporated into the CLEC's
monthly invoice.
3.5 This Attachment does not cover calls originating and billing within a state outside of AT&T MIDWEST REGION
5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE.
3.6 NICS does not include any interLATA and/or intraLATA long distance charges assessed by an Interexchange Carrier
(IXC).
3.7 The Party billing the End User shall be responsible for all uncollectible amounts.
3.8 Net payment shall be due within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the invoice.

this Agreement:
5.1.1 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE assume no liability for
any LEC’s or CLEC’s receipt of appropriate revenues due to it from any other entity. CLEC agrees that
AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable to it
for damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits and exemplary damages) which may be owed to it as a
result of any inaccurate or insufficient information resulting from any entity's actions, omissions, mistakes, or
negligence and upon which AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE may have relied in preparing settlement reports or performing any other act under this
Attachment.
5.1.2 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will not be liable for
any losses or damages arising out of errors, interruptions, defects, failures, or malfunction of services
provided pursuant to this Attachment, including those arising from associated equipment and data
processing systems, except such losses or damages caused by the sole negligence of AT&T MIDWEST
REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE. Any losses or damage for which AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and/or AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE is held liable under this

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC a Daily Usage File (DUF) for services provided
hereunder. A DUF will be provided by AT&T-22STATE in accordance with Exchange Message Interface (EMI)
guidelines supported by the Ordering and Billing Forum (OBF). Any exceptions to the supported formats will be
noted in the DUF implementation requirements documentation. The DUF will include (i) specific daily usage,
including both Section 251(b)(5) Traffic (if and where applicable) and LEC-carried IntraLATA Toll Traffic, in EMI
format for usage sensitive services furnished in connection with each service to the extent that similar usage
sensitive information is provided to retail End Users of AT&T-22STATE within that state, (ii) with sufficient detail to
enable CLEC to bill its End Users for usage sensitive services furnished by AT&T-22STATE in connection with
service provided by AT&T-22STATE, and (iii) operator handled calls provided by AT&T-22STATE. Procedures and
processes for implementing the interfaces with AT&T-22STATE will be included in implementation requirements
documentation.
2.0 General Provisions
2.1 Where available, DUF may be requested on flat-rated Resale lines as well as measured-rated Resale lines. DUF
provided in this instance is labeled as Enhanced DUF (EDUF). In order to receive EDUF on flat-rated Resale lines,
CLEC must also request and receive DUF on its measure-rated Resale lines.
2.2 File transmission for DUF is requested by each unique State and OCN combination. CLEC must provide to AT&T-
22STATE a separate written request for each unique State and OCN combination no less than sixty (60) calendar
days prior to the desired first transmission date for each file.
2.3 AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC for DUF in accordance with the applicable rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule
under “Electronic Billing Information Data (Daily Usage) per message”, “Provision of Message Detail a.k.a. Daily
Usage File (DUF), “FB-CLEC Operator Recording (Daily Usage) per message”, and “Daily Usage File (DUF) Data

and for EDUF provided on flat-rated Resale lines.
2.4 Call detail for LEC-carried calls that are alternately billed to CLEC End Users’ lines provided by AT&T-22STATE
through Resale will be forwarded to CLEC as rated call detail on the DUF.
2.5 Interexchange call detail on Resale Services that is forwarded to AT&T-22STATE for billing, which would otherwise
be processed by AT&T-22STATE for its retail End Users, will be returned to the IXC and will not be passed through
to CLEC. This call detail will be returned to the IXC with a transaction code indicating that the returned call originated
from a resold account. Billing for Information Services and other ancillary services traffic on Resale Services will be
passed through when AT&T-22STATE records the message.
2.6 Where CLEC is operating its own switch-based service and has contracted with AT&T-22STATE to provide operator
services, upon written request from CLEC, AT&T-22STATE will provide CLEC a DUF for operator handled calls

only for recurring charges. The rates implemented via this Agreement shall apply to all existing
Collocation arrangements that were established under the terms and conditions established
pursuant to 47 USC 251(c)(6) without the need for a specific request by the CLEC that such new
rates be implemented for each such Collocation arrangement. Adoption of a new rate structure
shall not by itself require purchaser to incur any new non-recurring Collocation area modification or
application charges. In the event that any order for any 251(c)(6) Collocation submitted by
Collocator is pending as of the Effective Date of the Agreement, any NRCs then due and owing or
otherwise then contemplated by such pending order shall be assessed in accordance with the

related activities that AT&T-22STATE or its subcontractors are performing in the general area of the
Collocator’s Dedicated Space, or in the general area of the AC and DC power plants which support the
Collocator’s equipment. If possible, notification of any emergency-related activity will be made immediately
prior to the start of the activity so that the Collocator may take reasonable actions necessary to protect the
Collocator’s Dedicated Space.
3.31 Eligible Structure List:
3.31.1 AT&T-22STATE shall maintain publicly available documents on AT&T CLEC Online website, indicating its
Eligible Structures, if any, that have no space available for Physical Collocation. AT&T-22STATE will
update this document within ten (10) calendar days of the date at which an Eligible Structure runs out of
such Collocation space.
3.31.2 AT&T-22STATE will remove obsolete unused equipment from its Eligible Structures that have no space
available for Collocation upon reasonable request by a Collocator or upon order of the Commission. AT&T-
22STATE shall reserve space for switching, MDF and Digital Cross Connect System (DCS) to
accommodate access line growth.
3.32 Legitimately Exhausted:
3.32.1 Before AT&T-22STATE may make a determination that space in an Eligible Structure is Legitimately
Exhausted, AT&T-22STATE must have removed all unused obsolete equipment from the Eligible Structure,
if requested by CLEC or required by the Commission, and made such space available for Collocation.
Removal of unused obsolete equipment shall not cause a delay in AT&T-22STATE’s response to a

4.8 Indemnification of AT&T-22STATE:
4.8.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, Indemnification is governed by the GT&Cs of this Agreement.
4.9 Casualty Loss:
4.9.1 Damage to Collocation Space:
4.9.1.1 If the Collocation Space is damaged by fire or other casualty that is not the result of the
Collocator’s or Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE AIS actions or those of a Third Party as hereinafter
described, and (1) the Collocation Space is not rendered untenantable in whole or in part, AT&T-
22STATE shall repair the same at its expense and the monthly charge shall not be abated, or (2)
the Collocation Space is rendered untenable in whole or in part and such damage or destruction
can be repaired within ninety (90) Business Days, AT&T-22STATE has the option to repair the
Collocation Space at its expense and the monthly charges shall be proportionately abated while
the Collocator was deprived of the use. If the Collocation Space cannot be repaired within ninety
(90) Business Days, or AT&T-22STATE opts not to rebuild, then AT&T-22STATE shall notify the
Collocator within thirty (30) Business Days following such occurrence that the Collocator’s use of
the Collocation Space will terminate as of the date of such damage. Upon the Collocator’s
election, subject to space availability and technical feasibility, AT&T-22STATE must provide to
the Collocator, a comparable substitute Collocation arrangement at another mutually agreeable
location at the applicable non-recurring charges for that arrangement and location.
4.9.1.2 Any obligation on the part of AT&T-22STATE to repair the Dedicated Space shall be limited to
repairing, restoring and rebuilding the Dedicated Space as prepared for the Collocator by AT&T-
22STATE.
4.10 Damage to Eligible Structure:
4.10.1 Notwithstanding that the Collocator’s Collocation Space may be unaffected thereby, in the event that the
Eligible Structure in which the Collocation Space is located shall be so damaged by fire or other casualty
that closing, demolition or substantial alteration or reconstruction of the Eligible Structure shall, in AT&T-
22STATE’s opinion be advisable, AT&T-22STATE, at its option, may terminate services provided via this
Attachment. AT&T-22STATE shall provide the Collocator ten (10) Business Days prior written notice of
termination within thirty (30) Business Days following the date of such occurrence, if possible.
4.11 Security:
4.11.1 AT&T-22STATE may impose the following reasonable security measures on Collocator to assist in
protecting its network and equipment from harm. AT&T-22STATE may use security measures expressly
allowed by the FCC. In addition, AT&T-22STATE may impose security arrangements as stringent as the
security arrangements AT&T-22STATE maintains at its own Eligible Structures either for its own employees
or for authorized contractors. To the extent security arrangements are more stringent for one group than the
other, AT&T-22STATE may impose the more stringent requirements. AT&T-22STATE will not impose
discriminatory security requirements that result in increased Collocation costs without the concomitant
benefit of providing necessary protection of AT&T-22STATE’s equipment. Neither Party will use any
information collected in the course of implementing or operating security arrangements for any marketing or
other purpose in aid of competing with the other Party.
4.11.2 Collocator will conduct background checks of its employee and/or the AT&T-22STATE AIS who will have
access to the Collocation space. Such background checks will include but are not to be limited to criminal
background checks for offenses involving theft or damage to property, and a check of FBI listings of known
or suspected terrorists.
4.11.3 Collocator shall provide its employees and/or the AT&T-22STATE AIS with picture identification, which must
be worn and visible at all times while in Collocator’s Collocation space or other areas in or around the
AT&T-22STATE Premises. The photo identification card shall bear, at a minimum, the employee’s name
and photo and Collocator’s name. AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to remove from an AT&T-22STATE
Premise any employee of Collocator not possessing identification issued by Collocator or who has violated
any of AT&T-22STATE’s policies as outlined in the CLEC Security Training documents.

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
4.11.3.1 Collocator technicians will be security-qualified by the Collocator and will be required to be
knowledgeable of AT&T-22STATE’s security standards. Collocator personnel and technicians
will undergo the same level of security training or its equivalent that AT&T-22STATE’s own
employees and authorized contractors must undergo. AT&T-22STATE will not, however,
require Collocator to receive security training from AT&T-22STATE, but will provide information
to Collocator on the specific type of training required. Collocator can then provide its employees
with its own security training.
4.11.3.2 Collocator and AT&T-22STATE will each establish disciplinary procedures up to and including
dismissal or denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other property of AT&T-22STATE for
certain specified actions that damage, or place the equipment, facilities, or the network or
personnel of the Collocator or AT&T-22STATE in jeopardy. The following are actions that could
damage or place the Eligible Structure, or the network or the personnel of the Collocator or
AT&T-22STATE in jeopardy and may justify disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or
the denial of access to the Eligible Structure and other AT&T-22STATE property:
4.11.3.2.1 Theft or destruction of AT&T-22STATE’s or Collocator’s property;
4.11.3.2.2 Use/sale or attempted use/sale of alcohol or illegal drugs on AT&T-22STATE
property;
4.11.3.2.3 Threats or violent acts against other persons on AT&T-22STATE property;
4.11.3.2.4 Knowing violations of any local, state or federal law or the requirements of this
Agreement on AT&T-22STATE property;
4.11.3.2.5 Permitting unauthorized persons access to AT&T-22STATE or Collocator’s
equipment on AT&T-22STATE property; and
4.11.3.2.6 Carrying a weapon on AT&T-22STATE property.
4.11.3.3 In addition, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to interview Collocator’s employees, agents,
suppliers, or Guests in the event of wrongdoing in or around an AT&T-22STATE Premises or
involving AT&T-22STATE’s or another Collocated Telecommunications Carrier’s property or
personnel, provided that AT&T-22STATE shall provide reasonable notice to Collocator’s
Security representative of such interview. Collocator and its employees, agents, suppliers, or
Guests shall reasonably cooperate with AT&T-22STATE’s investigation into allegations of
wrongdoing or criminal conduct committed by, witnessed by, or involving Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests. Additionally, AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to bill
Collocator for all reasonable costs associated with investigations involving its employees,
agents, suppliers, or Guests if it is established and mutually agreed in good faith that Collocator’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests are responsible for the alleged act(s). Collocator and
AT&T-22STATE will take appropriate disciplinary steps as determined by each Party to address
any violations reported by AT&T-22STATE or the Collocator.
4.11.3.4 AT&T-22STATE may use reasonable security measures to protect its equipment. In the event
AT&T-22STATE elects to erect an interior security partition in a given Eligible Structure to
separate its equipment, AT&T-22STATE may recover the costs of the partition in lieu of the
costs of other reasonable security measures if the partition costs are lower than the costs of any
other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. In no event shall a Collocator be
required to pay for both an interior security partition to separate AT&T-22STATE’s equipment in
an Eligible Structure and any other reasonable security measure for such Eligible Structure. If
AT&T-22STATE elects to erect an interior security partition and recover the cost, it must
demonstrate to the Physical Collocator that other reasonable security methods cost more than
an interior security partition around AT&T-22STATE’s equipment at the time the price quote is
given.
4.11.3.4.1 AT&T-22STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own
equipment shall not interfere with a CLEC’s access to its equipment, including
equipment Collocated directly adjacent to AT&T-22STATE’s equipment. AT&T-

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 18 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
22STATE’s construction of an interior security partition around its own equipment
shall not impede a Telecommunications Carrier’s ability to Collocate within AT&T-
22STATE’s space. To the extent that AT&T-22STATE is required to install
additional security measures within its interior security partition because a CLEC
has access to its own equipment within the area, such security measures shall be
constructed and maintained at AT&T-22STATE’s expense.
4.11.3.4.2 AT&T-22STATE’s enclosure of its own equipment will not unreasonably increase a
CLEC’s cost nor shall it result in duplicative security costs. The cost of an interior
security partition around AT&T-22STATE’s equipment cannot include any
embedded costs of any other security measures for the Eligible Structure.
5.0 Collocation Space
5.1 Use of Collocation Space:
5.1.1 Nature of Use – Equipment Permitted to be Collocated
5.1.1.1 Equipment is considered necessary for Interconnection if an inability to deploy that equipment
would, as a practical, economic, or operations matter, preclude the Collocator from obtaining
Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE at a level equal in quality to that which AT&T-22STATE
obtains within its own network or AT&T-22STATE provides to an Affiliate, subsidiary, or other
Party.
5.1.1.2 Equipment is considered necessary for access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if an inability to deploy that
equipment would, as a practical, economic, or operational matter, preclude the Collocator from
obtaining non-discriminatory access to that 251(c)(3) UNE.
5.1.1.3 Examples of equipment that would not be considered necessary include, but are not limited to:
traditional circuit switching equipment, equipment used exclusively for call-related databases,
computer servers used exclusively for providing information services, OSS equipment used to
support collocated Telecommunications carrier network operations, equipment that generates
customer orders, manages trouble tickets or inventory, or stores customer records in centralized
databases, etc.
5.1.1.4 AT&T-22STATE will determine upon receipt of an application if the requested equipment is
necessary based on the criteria established by the FCC. In order to make this determination,
AT&T-22STATE may need to request additional information from Collocator. Collocator agrees
to use its best efforts to provide such information to AT&T-22STATE in a timely manner.
5.1.2 Multi-functional equipment shall be deemed necessary for Interconnection or access to a 251(c)(3) UNE if,
and only if, the primary purpose and function of the equipment (as the Collocator seeks to deploy it) meets
either or both of the standards set forth above in this Section. For a piece of multi-functional equipment to
be utilized primarily to obtain equal in quality Interconnection or non-discriminatory access to one (1) or
more 251(c)(3) UNEs, there also must be a logical connection or link between the additional functions the
equipment would perform and the Telecommunication Services the Collocator seeks to provide to its End
Users by means of the interconnection or 251(c)(3) UNE. The additional functions of the equipment that, as
stand-alone functions, do not meet either of the standards set forth above in this Section must not cause the
equipment to significantly increase the burden of AT&T-22STATE’s property.
5.2 Demarcation Point - AT&T-22STATE
5.2.1 AT&T-22STATE will designate the point(s) of demarcation between Collocator’s equipment and/or network
facilities and AT&T-22STATE’s network facilities. For DS0, DS1, DS3 and fiber terminations, AT&T-
22STATE shall designate, provide and install demarcation point hardware on a per arrangement basis.
Collocator shall utilize an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 to installing their interconnection cabling to the AT&T-
22STATE designated demarcation point.
5.2.2 The Physical Collocator or its AT&T-22STATE AIS, must install, maintain and operate the
equipment/facilities on its side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be
required within its own Collocation Space to activate service requests.

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
5.2.3 The Virtual Collocator via its AT&T-22STATE AIS must install and operate the equipment/facilities on its
side of the demarcation point, and may self-provision cross-connects that may be required within its own
Collocation Space to activate service requests. AT&T-22STATE will maintain the Virtual Collocation
arrangement.
5.3 Types of Available Physical Collocation Arrangements:
5.3.1 AT&T-22STATE will make each of the arrangements outlined below available within its Eligible Structures in
accordance with this Attachment and the AT&T CLEC Online Collocation Handbook so that Collocator will
have a variety of Collocation options from which to choose.
5.3.2 Caged Physical Collocation:
5.3.2.1 Caged Collocation option provides the Physical Collocator with an individual enclosure (not
including a top). This enclosure is an area designated by AT&T-22STATE within an Eligible
Structure to be used by the Physical Collocator for the sole purpose of installing, maintaining and
operating the Physical Collocator-provided equipment for the purpose of Interconnection under
Section 251(c)(2) and access to 251(c)(3) UNEs. Accordingly, AT&T-22STATE will not provide
the Physical Collocator with direct access to AT&T-22STATE’s MDF, with the exception of the
AT&T-22STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.3.2.2 AT&T-22STATE will provide floor space, floor space site conditioning, cage common systems
materials, cage preparation, and safety and security charges in increments of one (1) square
foot. For this reason, the Physical Collocator will be able to order space and a cage enclosure in
amounts as small as that sufficient to house and maintain a single rack or bay of equipment
(minimum of fifty (50) square feet of caged space) and will ensure that the first Physical
Collocator in an AT&T-22STATE Premises will not be responsible for the entire cost of site
preparation and security.
5.3.2.3 At the Physical Collocator’s option, the Collocator may elect to install its own enclosure, but must
comply with all methods, procedures and guidelines followed by AT&T-22STATE in constructing
such an arrangement. The Physical Collocator may provide a cage enclosure (which shall not
include a top), cable rack and support structure inside the cage, lighting, receptacles, cage
grounding, cage sign and door key set. In addition, terms and conditions for contractors
performing cage construction activities as set forth following will apply.
5.3.3 Shared Caged Collocation:
5.3.3.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide Shared Caged Collocation as set forth in the AT&T CLEC Online
Handbook. Two (2) or more Physical Collocators may initially apply at the same time to share a
Caged Collocation space as set forth in 2.0 above. Charges to each Physical Collocator will be
based upon the percentage of total space utilized by each Physical Collocator.
5.3.4 Guest-Host Collocation (Also known as Sub-Lease Collocation):
5.3.4.1 The Physical Collocator may allow other Telecommunications Carriers to share the Physical
Collocator’s caged Collocation space, pursuant to the terms and conditions agreed to by the
Physical Collocator (Host) and the other Telecommunication Carriers (Guests) which must be
consistent with the provisions contained in this Section and this Agreement, except where the
AT&T-22STATE Premises is located within a leased space and AT&T-22STATE is prohibited by
said lease from offering such an option to the Physical Collocator. AT&T-22STATE shall be
notified in writing by the Physical Collocator upon the execution of any agreement between the
Host and its Guest(s) prior to the submission of an application. Further, such notification shall
include the name of the Guest(s), the term of the agreement, and a certification by the Physical
Collocator that said agreement imposes upon the Guest(s) the same terms and conditions for
Collocation space as set forth in this Attachment between AT&T-22STATE and the Physical
Collocator. The term of the agreement between the Host and its Guest(s) shall not exceed the
term of this Agreement between AT&T-22STATE and the Physical Collocator.

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 20 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
5.3.4.2 The Physical Collocator, as the Host, shall be the sole interface and the responsible Party to
AT&T-22STATE for the assessment and billing of rates and charges contained within this
Attachment and for the purposes of ensuring that the safety and security requirements of this
Attachment are fully complied with by the Guest(s), the Guest(s) employees and agents. There
will be a minimum charge of one (1) bay/rack per Host/Guest. In addition to the above, the
Physical Collocator shall be the responsible Party to AT&T-22STATE for the purpose of
submitting applications for initial and additional equipment placement for the Guest(s).
5.3.4.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guest(s) may submit service orders to AT&T-22STATE to
request the provisioning of interconnecting facilities between AT&T-22STATE and the Guest(s),
the provisioning of services, and/or access to Section 251(c)(3) UNEs. The bill for these
interconnecting facilities, services and Section 251(c)(3) UNEs will be charged to the Guest(s)
pursuant to the applicable the Guest’s Interconnection Agreement with AT&T-22STATE.
5.3.5 Cageless Collocation:
5.3.5.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide cageless Collocation in any Collocation space that is supported by
the existing Telecommunications infrastructure. AT&T-22STATE will provide space in single bay
increments, including available space adjacent to or next to AT&T-22STATE’s equipment as
needed.
5.3.5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall allow the Physical Collocator to collocate the Physical Collocator’s
equipment and facilities without requiring the construction of a cage or similar structure.
5.3.5.3 Except where the Physical Collocator’s equipment requires special technical considerations
(e.g., special cable racking or isolated ground plane), AT&T-22STATE shall assign cageless
Collocation arrangement in conventional equipment rack lineups where feasible. For equipment
requiring special technical considerations, the Physical Collocator must provide the equipment
layout, including spatial dimensions for such equipment pursuant to generic requirements
contained in TP-76200, and shall be responsible for compliance with all special technical
requirements associated with such equipment.
5.4 Adjacent On-Site Collocation:
5.4.1 Where Physical Collocation space within the AT&T-22STATE CO is Legitimately Exhausted AT&T-
22STATE will permit the Physical Collocator to Physically Collocate on AT&T-22STATE’s property in the
Physical Collocator’s adjacent structures similar to structures that AT&T-22STATE uses to house
Telecommunication Equipment, to the extent Technically Feasible.
5.4.2 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC will mutually agree on the location of the designated space on AT&T-22STATE
premises where the Adjacent Structure will be placed. AT&T-22STATE will not unreasonably withhold
agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator. Safety and maintenance requirements, zoning,
future building expansion and other state and local regulations are all examples of reasonable grounds to
withhold agreement as to the site desired by the Physical Collocator.
5.4.3 AT&T-22STATE will offer the following increments of power to the Adjacent Structure:
5.4.3.1 a standard offering of one hundred (100) amps of AC power to the Adjacent Structure when CO
Switchboard AC capacity exists; or
5.4.3.2 DC power within two (2) cable options that allow increments of 2-100 (100A feed and 100B feed)
Amp Power Feeds, 2-200 (200A feed and 200B feed) Amp Power Feeds, 2-300 (300A feed and
300B feed) Amp Power Feeds, and 2-400 (400A feed and 400B feed) Amp Power Feeds to the
Adjacent Structure from the CO Power source.
5.4.4 At its option, the Physical Collocator may choose to provide its own AC and DC power to the Adjacent
Structure.
5.4.5 AT&T-22STATE will provide Physical Collocation services to such Adjacent Structures, subject to the same
requirements as other Collocation arrangements in this Attachment.
5.4.6 AT&T-22STATE shall permit the Physical Collocator to place its own equipment, including, but not limited
to, copper cables, coaxial cables, fiber cables and Telecommunications Equipment, in adjacent facilities
constructed by the Physical Collocator’s AT&T-22STATE AIS. Accordingly, AT&T-22STATE will not

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 21 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
provide the Physical Collocator’s personnel or agents with direct access to AT&T-22STATE’s MDF, with the
exception of the AT&T-22STATE’s AIS Tier 1.
5.4.7 The Physical Collocator shall be responsible for securing all required licenses and permits, the required site
preparations and shall further retain responsibility for securing and/or constructing the Adjacent Structure
and any building and site maintenance associated with the placement of such Adjacent Structure.
5.4.8 Regeneration is required for Collocation in an Adjacent Structure if the cabling distance between the
Physical Collocator’s POT bay or termination point located in an Adjacent Structure and AT&T-22STATE’s
cross-connect bay exceeds American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) limitations. Regeneration is
not required in any other circumstances except where the Physical Collocator specifically requests
regeneration. Required regeneration and Physical Collocator requested regeneration will be provided at the
Physical Collocator’s expense.
5.4.9 In the event that interior space in an Eligible Structure becomes available, AT&T-22STATE will provide the
option to the Physical Collocator to relocate its equipment from an Adjacent on-site facility into the interior
space. In the event the Physical Collocator chooses to relocate its equipment into the interior space,
appropriate charges applicable for Collocation within the Eligible Structure will apply.
5.4.10 If a Physical Collocator elects to provide an Adjacent On-Site Space Collocation as described above, when
all available space for Physical Collocation is Legitimately Exhausted inside an AT&T-22STATE Eligible
Structure, AT&T-22STATE will charge Planning Fees to recover the costs incurred to estimate the quotation
of charges for the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site Collocation arrangement request. Rates and charges are
found in the Pricing Schedule. In addition, should the Collocator elect to have AT&T-22STATE provision an
extension of DC Power Service from the Eligible Structure to the Adjacent Structure, a Collocator
Interconnect Power Panel (CIPP) will be required.
5.4.11 Adjacent On-site Planning Fee:
5.4.11.1 An initial Planning Fee will apply when a Collocator is requesting any Interconnection
Terminations between the Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure and AT&T-22STATE on an
initial or subsequent Adjacent On-site collocation application. This fee recovers the design route
of the Interconnection Terminations as well as the design route of the power arrangement to the
Collocator’s Adjacent On-site structure.
5.5 Virtual Collocation:
5.5.1 Virtual Collocation for the purpose of Interconnection under Section 251(c)(2) to AT&T-22STATE or access
to AT&T-22STATE provided 251(c)(3) UNEs is ordered as set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s Interconnector’s
Collocation Services Handbook for Virtual Collocation. AT&T-22STATE will designate the location or
locations within its wire centers, CEVs, huts and cabinets for the placement of all equipment and facilities
associated with Virtual Collocation. Virtual Collocation does not involve the reservation of segregated CO or
CEV, hut and Cabinet space for the use of Virtual Collocator. AT&T-22STATE will provide Virtual
Collocation for the Virtual Collocator’s comparable equipment as it provides to itself in the CO, wire center,
CEV, hut or Cabinet, as the case may be, subject to the requirements of this Agreement.
6.0 Reports
6.1 Space Availability Report:
6.1.1 CLEC may request a space availability report prior to its application for Collocation space within AT&T-
22STATE’s Eligible Structures. This report will specify the amount of Collocation space available at each
requested Eligible Structure, the number of Collocators, and any modifications in the use of the space since
the last report. The report will also include measures that AT&T-22STATE is taking to make additional
space available for Collocation. CLEC may access the appropriate form for the space availability report on
the AT&T CLEC Online website. A space availability report does not reserve space at the AT&T-22STATE
Premises for which the space availability report was requested by CLEC.
6.1.2 Fees for such reports are shown in the Pricing Schedule.

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 22 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
7.0 Application Process
7.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide Collocation arrangements in Eligible Structures on a “first-come, first-served” basis. To
apply for a Dedicated Space in a particular Eligible Structure CLEC and AT&T-22STATE will follow the Collocation
Application (“Application”) process in the AT&T-22STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook at the
AT&T CLEC Online website. The Collocator will provide a completed Application through the Collocation Application
Web Portal via AT&T-22STATE’s CLEC Online website and will pay AT&T-22STATE an initial Planning/Application
Fee as found in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.1 Application for Multiple Methods of Collocation:
7.1.1.1 A Collocator wishing AT&T-22STATE to consider multiple methods for Collocation in an Eligible
Structure on a single Application will need to include in each Application a prioritized list of its
preferred methods of collocating, (e.g., caged, cageless, or other, as well as adequate
information), (e.g., specific layout requirements, cage size, number of bays, requirements
relative to adjacent bays, etc.) for AT&T-22STATE to process the Application for each of the
preferred methods. If a Collocator provides adequate information and its preferences with its
Application, AT&T-22STATE would not require an additional Application, nor would the
Collocator be required to restart the quotation interval should its first choice not be available in
an Eligible Structure.
7.2 Complete and Accurate Application Review Process:
7.2.1 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and initial Planning/Application Fee
payment, AT&T-22STATE will begin development of the quotation.
7.2.2 In responding to an Application request, if space and interconnection facilities are available and all other
Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-22STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request for space is
granted, confirm the applicable NRC and MRC rates and the estimated provisioning interval. AT&T-
22STATE will not select for Collocator the type of Collocation to be ordered.
7.2.3 All applicable NRCs are required to be paid to AT&T-22STATE prior to the Collocation space being turned
over to the Collocator. AT&T-13STATE processes the payment of the aforementioned NRCs in two
installments: Fifty percent (50%) of the applicable NRCs are due upon the Collocator’s deliverance of the
signed BFFO to AT&T-13STATE with the remaining fifty percent (50%) payment due two (2) weeks prior to
the Collocation space turnover. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will issue a bill for all applicable
NRCs to the Collocator’s after the Collocator’s deliverance of the signed BFFO.
7.3 Space Unavailability Determination and Resolution:
7.3.1 In responding to an Application request if space is not available, AT&T-22STATE will notify the Collocator
that its application for Collocation Space is denied due to the lack of space and no Application fee shall
apply. If AT&T-22STATE knows when additional Collocation space may become available at the AT&T-
22STATE CO requested by Collocator such information will be provided to Collocator in AT&T-22STATE’s
written denial of Collocation Space. AT&T-22STATE in its denial will provide the Collocator with any other
known methods of Collocation that may be available within the Eligible Structure that the Collocator’s
Application addressed. If the Collocator determines the alternative method of collocation meets their needs,
the Collocator will be required to submit a new collocation application and pay the initial Planning Fee.
7.3.2 The notification will include a possible future space relief date, if applicable. At that time, any non-recurring
charges collected with the Application, including the Planning Fee, will be returned to the Collocator. When
AT&T-22STATE’s response includes an amount of space less than that requested by Collocator or space
that is configured differently, no Application fee will apply. If Collocator decides to accept the available
space, Collocator must resubmit its Application to reflect the actual space available including the
reconfiguration of the space. When Collocator resubmits its Application to accept the available space,
AT&T-22STATE will bill the applicable Application/Planning fee.
7.3.3 In the event of a denial, AT&T-22STATE will file a notice that the Collocator’s request was denied with the
Commission. When contested in support of its denial, AT&T-22STATE will concurrently submit to both the
Commission and the Collocator, provided under seal and subject to proprietary protections, the following
when applicable:

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 23 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
7.3.3.1 central office common language location identifier (CLLI);
7.3.3.2 the identity of the requesting Collocator;
7.3.3.3 amount of space requested by the Collocator;
7.3.3.4 the total amount of space at the AT&T-22STATE premises;
7.3.3.5 floor plan documentation (as provided for in the Space Availability Determination section of the
Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook);
7.3.3.6 identification of switch turnaround plans and other equipment removal plans and timelines; if any,
7.3.3.7 CO rearrangement/expansion plans; if any,
7.3.3.8 and description of other plans, if any, that may relieve space exhaustion.
7.3.4 In the event AT&T-22STATE denies a Collocator’s request and the Collocator disputes the denial, the
Collocator may request a tour of the Eligible Structure to verify space availability or the lack thereof. The
request shall be submitted to AT&T-22STATE’s designated representative in writing. Time limits
established by the FCC must be respected. The inspection tour shall be scheduled as mutually agreeable.
7.3.5 Prior to the inspection tour, a “Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement” shall be signed by the designated
AT&T-22STATE representative and the representative the Collocator, who will participate in the tour.
7.3.6 AT&T-22STATE will provide all relevant documentation to the Collocator including blueprints and plans for
future facility expansions or enhancements, subject to executing the Reciprocal Non-disclosure Agreement.
AT&T-22STATE’s representative will accompany and supervise the Collocator agent on the inspection tour.
7.3.7 If the Collocator believes, based on the inspection tour of the Eligible Structure facilities, that the denial of
Physical Collocation space is unsupportable, the Collocator agent shall promptly so advise AT&T-
22STATE. The Collocator and AT&T-22STATE shall then each concurrently prepare a report detailing its
own findings of the inspection tour. The Collocator and AT&T-22STATE reports shall be concurrently
served on each other and submitted to the Commission no later than forty-five (45) calendar days following
the filing of the request for space. The burden of proof shall be on AT&T-22STATE to justify the basis for
any denial of collocation requests.
7.4 Revisions:
7.4.1 If a modification or revision is made to any information in the Application after AT&T-22STATE has provided
the Application response and prior to a BFFO, with the exception of modifications to (1) Customer
Information, (2) Contact Information or (3) Billing Contact Information, whether at the request of Collocator
or as necessitated by technical considerations, the Application shall be considered a new Application and
handled as a new Application with respect to the response and provisioning intervals. AT&T-22STATE will
charge Collocator the appropriate Application/Augment fee associated with the level of assessment
performed by AT&T-22STATE.
7.4.2 Once AT&T-22STATE has provided the BFFO/quote and CLEC has accepted and authorized AT&T-
22STATE to begin construction, any further modifications and/or revisions must be made via a subsequent
Collocation Application and the appropriate fees will apply.
7.5 Augments:
7.5.1 A request from a Collocator to add or modify space, equipment, and/or cable to an existing Collocation
arrangement is considered an Augment. Such a request must be made via a complete and accurate
Application.
7.5.2 Upon receipt of the Collocator’s complete and accurate Application and Planning Fee payment, AT&T-
22STATE will begin development of the Augment quotation. In responding to an Augment request, if power
and/or Interconnection facilities are available and all other Collocation requirements are met, AT&T-
22STATE shall advise the Collocator that its request is granted, confirm the applicable non-recurring and
recurring rates and the estimated provisioning interval.
7.5.3 Several types of Augments are identified in the Collocation Section of the AT&T CLEC Online website.
Those Augments will have associated pricing within the Pricing Schedule. Examples are:
7.5.3.1 100 Copper cable pair connections

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 24 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
7.5.3.2 28 DS1 connections; and/or
7.5.3.3 1 DS3 connections; and/or
7.5.3.4 24 fiber connections
7.6 For all Augments other than provided above, AT&T-22STATE will work cooperatively with Collocator to negotiate a
mutually agreeable delivery interval. All intervals and procedures associated with Augment Applications can be
found in AT&T-22STATE’s Interconnector’s Collocation Services Handbook at the AT&T CLEC Online website.
7.7 Intervals for Interconnection & Power Cabling:
7.7.1 CLEC shall consult the AT&T CLEC Online Handbook for information regarding interval changes regarding
Interconnection to and/or Power Cabling changes. CLEC must use an AT&T-22STATE AIS to establish
Interconnection and/or Power cabling as outlined in the appropriate TP.
8.0 Augment Application
8.1 In the event Collocator or the Physical Collocator’s Guest(s) desires to modify its use of the Collocation space in a
CO after a BFFO, Collocator shall complete a new Application that contains all of the detailed information associated
with a requested alteration of the Collocation space. The subsequent Application will be processed by AT&T-
22STATE when it is complete and accurate, meaning that all of the required fields on the Subsequent Application
have been completed with the appropriate type of information associated with the requested alteration. AT&T-
22STATE shall determine what modifications, if any, to the AT&T-22STATE Premises are required to accommodate
the change(s) requested by Collocator in the subsequent Application. Such modifications to the AT&T-22STATE
Premises may include, but are not limited to, floor loading changes, changes necessary to meet HVAC requirements,
changes to power plant requirements, equipment additions, etc.
9.0 Cancellation Prior to Due Date
9.1 In the event that the Collocator cancels its Collocation Application after AT&T-22STATE has begun preparation of
the Telecommunications Infrastructure Space and Dedicated Space, but before AT&T-22STATE has been paid the
entire amounts due under this Attachment, then in addition to other remedies that AT&T-22STATE might have, the
Collocator shall be liable in the amount equal to the non-recoverable costs less estimated net salvage, the total of
which is not to exceed the Preparation Charges. Non-recoverable costs include the non-recoverable cost of
equipment and material ordered, provided or used; the non-recoverable cost of installation and removal, including the
costs of equipment and material ordered, provided or used; labor; transportation and any other associated costs.
Upon Collocator’s request, AT&T-22STATE will provide the Collocator with a detailed invoice showing the costs it
incurred associated with preparation.
10.0 Occupancy – Physical Collocation Only
10.1 Unless there are unusual circumstances, AT&T-22STATE will notify the Physical Collocator that the Dedicated
Space is ready for occupancy after AT&T-22STATE’s completion of preparation of the Dedicated Space. All MRCs
and NRCs will begin to accrue on the date that the Collocation space construction had been completed by AT&T-
22STATE (“Space Ready Date”), regardless of any failure by the Physical Collocator to complete its work or occupy
the space.
10.2 After the Physical Collocator’s receipt of such notice, the Physical Collocator shall request within fifteen (15) calendar
days an acceptance walk-through of the Collocation space with AT&T-22STATE. The acceptance walk-through will
be scheduled on a mutually agreed upon date. Any material deviations from mutually agreed Application
specifications may be noted by the Physical Collocator as exceptions, which to qualify as exceptions, must be agreed
to as exceptions by AT&T-22STATE. The agreed upon exceptions shall be corrected by AT&T-22STATE by a
mutually agreed upon date. The correction of these exceptions shall be at AT&T-22STATE’s expense. AT&T-
22STATE will then establish a new Space Ready Date.
10.3 Upon completion of corrections described in Section 10.2, AT&T-22STATE will again notify the Physical Collocator
that the Dedicated Space is ready for occupancy and the Parties will, upon Collocator’s request, conduct a follow-up
acceptance walk-through as set forth in this Section. This follow-up acceptance walkthrough will be limited to only
those corrections identified and agreed to by the Parties in the initial walkthrough, as described in Section 10.2
above. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is not requested by the Physical Collocator within fifteen (15) calendar
days, the Space Ready Date shall be deemed to be the Delivery Date. If a follow-up acceptance walk-through is

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 25 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
requested, but no continuing material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date of the follow-up acceptance walk-through. If a follow-up acceptance
walk-through is requested, and material exceptions are mutually agreed upon at the follow-up walk-through, the
Delivery Date will be deemed to be the date upon which the Physical Collocator accepts all corrections to such
exceptions, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.4 All charges to the Physical Collocator will begin to accrue on the Effective Billing Date, regardless of any failure by
Collocator to complete its work or occupy the space. In the case of the termination of this Agreement prior to term, or
the early termination of any Collocation services, AT&T-22STATE shall be entitled to full payment within thirty (30)
calendar days of such expiration or termination for all services performed and expenses accrued or incurred that
AT&T-22STATE is entitled to recover under the provisions of this Attachment for establishing such Collocation
arrangement prior to such expiration or termination.
10.5 If the Physical Collocator cancels or abandons its Collocation space in any of AT&T-22STATE COs before AT&T-
22STATE has recovered the full cost associated with providing that space to the Physical Collocator, the amount of
any such remaining costs shall become immediately due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Physical Collocator abandons that space.
10.6 The Physical Collocator shall notify AT&T-22STATE in writing that its Collocation equipment installation is complete.
For purposes of this Section, the Collocator’s Telecommunications Equipment is considered to be operational and
Interconnected when it is connected to either AT&T-22STATE’s network or interconnected to another Third Party
Collocator’s equipment that resides within the same structure, provided the Third Party Collocator’s equipment is
used for Interconnection with AT&T-22STATE’s network or to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE’s 251(c)(3) UNEs.
For the purpose of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE may refuse to accept any orders for cross-connects until it has
received such notice from Physical the Collocator.
10.7 Early Space Acceptance:
10.7.1 If Physical Collocator decides to occupy the Collocation space prior to the Space Ready Date, the date
Physical Collocator executes the Agreement for “Customer Access and Acceptance to Unfinished
Collocation Space” is the date that will be deemed the space acceptance date and billing will begin from that
date.
10.7.2 The Physical Collocator will, whenever possible, place its Telecommunications Equipment in the Collocation
space within thirty (30) calendar days of space turnover. Operational Telecommunications Equipment must
be placed in the Dedicated Space and interconnected to AT&T-22STATE’s network pursuant to Section
251(c)(2) or used to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs within one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days after receipt of Notice that AT&T-22STATE has completed its work as required by the
complete and accurate Collocation Application.
10.8 Reclamation of Dedicated Space:
10.8.1 If the Physical Collocator fails to place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space
to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE to obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs meeting all the
requirements of Section 5.1 above and 10.7 above and the space is needed to meet customer demand
(filed application for space, accompanied by all fees) for another Collocator or to avoid construction of a
building addition, then AT&T-22STATE has the right to reclaim the Dedicated Space. AT&T-22STATE will
send the Physical Collocator written Notice of its intent to terminate the Physical Collocator’s Collocation
arrangement in the prepared Dedicated Space within ten (10) Business Days after the notice date. If the
Physical Collocator does not place operational Telecommunications Equipment in the Dedicated Space and
interconnect with AT&T-22STATE or obtain access to AT&T-22STATE 251(c)(3) UNEs by that tenth (10th)
Business Day then the Collocation is deemed terminated and the Physical Collocator shall be liable in an
amount equal to the unpaid balance of the applicable charges.
10.8.2 If the Physical Collocator causes AT&T-22STATE to prepare the Dedicated Space and then the Physical
Collocator does not use the Dedicated Space (or all of the Dedicated Space), the Physical Collocator will
pay AT&T-22STATE the monthly recurring and other applicable charges as if the Physical Collocator were
using the entire Dedicated Space, until such time as the Physical Collocator submits a complete and
accurate decommissioning Application, and the decommissioning process is completed as required.

19.5 Power Reduction:
19.5.1 The Collocator may request to decrease the amount of existing power available to a Collocation
Arrangement. This can be done either by disconnecting and removing a power cable feed or by replacing
the existing fuse with a fuse of a lower breakdown rating on a power cable feed. If the Collocator desires to
disconnect a power arrangement (A&B feed), the Collocator will be responsible for hiring an AT&T-
22STATE AIS Tier 1 to remove the terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to
the AT&T-22STATE rack level that make up the power arrangement. If the Collocator desires to reduce the
amperage on a power cable feed, the Collocator will be responsible for paying the costs necessary to
change the fuse that serves the A&B feeds at the AT&T-22STATE power source. In either case, the
Collocator must maintain a minimum amount of power on at least one power arrangement (A&B feed) to
service their Collocation Arrangement when submitting their power reduction request. The Collocator shall
submit an augment application in order to process this request.
19.5.2 If the Collocator desires to only reduce the fuse capacity on an existing power arrangement (A&B feed)
rather than disconnect and remove cable to an existing power arrangement, they may only reduce the fuse
size to the lowest power amp increment offered in this Attachment referenced in 19.2 above. Different
minimum amp increments apply for power arrangements fed from either an AT&T-22STATE BDFB or an
AT&T-22STATE power plant. When the Collocator is requesting to reduce the fuse capacity only, the fees
referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply. When the Collocator has only one power arrangement (A&B

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE
Page 33 of 34
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
feed) serving their Collocation Arrangement, a fuse reduction is the only power reduction option available to
the Collocator.
19.5.3 When a power reduction request involves a fuse change only on a power arrangement serviced from the
AT&T-22STATE BDFB (e.g., power arrangements less than or equal to a fifty (50) amp A feed and a fifty
(50) amp B feed) the Collocator must hire an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 to coordinate fuse changes at the
AT&T-22STATE BDFB. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule will still apply. When a power
reduction request involves a fuse change on a power arrangement serviced from the AT&T-22STATE
Power Plant (e.g., power arrangements consisting of a one hundred (100) amp A feed and a one hundred
(100) amp B feed and above), the Collocator must hire an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 power supplier to
coordinate the fuse changes at the AT&T-22STATE power plant.
19.5.4 When a power reduction request requires disconnecting and removing a power cable feed from either the
AT&T-22STATE’s BDFB (Battery Distribution Fuse Bay) or power plant, the AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 will
perform the power cable removal work up to the rack level. Applicable fees referenced in Pricing Schedule
will apply. Within thirty (30) calendar days after submitting its power reduction request to disconnect and
remove a power arrangement, the Collocator must perform the following activity:
19.5.4.1 Remove terminations at both ends of the power cable feed and cut cables up to the AT&T-
22STATE rack level. Collocator must use an AT&T-22STATE AIS Tier 1 for this procedure and
that supplier must follow TP76300 guidelines for cutting and capping the cable at the rack level.
19.6 When the Collocator has multiple power arrangement serving a Collocation Arrangement (e.g., one power
arrangement consisting of fifty (50) amps on the A feed and fifty (50) amps on the B feed and a second power
arrangement consisting of twenty (20) amps on the A feed and twenty (20) amps on the B feed), the Collocator has
the option of either fusing down the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed) or disconnecting and removing the
power cable feed from the fifty (50) amp power arrangement (A&B feed). If the Collocator chooses to disconnect and
remove the power cable feed from a power arrangement (A&B feed), then the charges referenced in Pricing
Schedule will apply. If the Collocator has multiple power arrangements (A&B feed) where they can request both a
fuse reduction and a power cable removal for one Collocation Arrangement [e.g., reduce one power arrangement
from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to twenty (20) amps (A&B feed) and remove the power cable from a second power
arrangement from fifty (50) amps (A&B feed) to ten (10) amps (A&B feed)], then the project management fee for
power cable removal referenced in the Pricing Schedule will apply in addition to the individual charges referenced in
the Pricing Schedule associated with the overall power reduction request.
19.7 For any power reduction request (one which involves either a disconnect and removal, re-fusing only, or a
combination of the two), the Collocator must submit an augment application for this request along with the
appropriate application and project management fees referenced in the Pricing Schedule. The same Augment
intervals that are outlined in this Attachment for adding power will apply to power reduction requests.
20.0 Collocation in CEVs, Huts and Cabinets
20.1 Remote Terminals - When the requirements of this Agreement are met, collocation will be allowed in Controlled
Environmental Vaults (CEVs), Huts and Cabinets and other AT&T-22STATE owned or controlled premises where
Collocation is practical and Technically Feasible, (e.g., where heat dissipation is not severely limited and there is
sufficient space for Collocator’s equipment).
20.2 AT&T-13STATE will assign space in a RT in two-inch vertical mounting space increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of two-inch vertical mounting spaces required is
determined by the size of the equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and
ventilation of the equipment to be placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates.
20.3 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will also assign space in a RT in single bay increments within a CEV, Hut or
cabinet for the placement of Collocator’s equipment. The number of bays required is determined by the size of the
equipment to be placed plus additional space required for heat dissipation and ventilation of the equipment to be
placed in adjacent equipment. Refer to the Pricing Schedule for rates and charges.
20.4 AT&T-22STATE: RT Collocation Arrangements - AT&T-22STATE shall make available -48V DC power for
Collocator’s RT Collocation arrangement at an AT&T-22STATE power source within the RT. The charge for power
shall be assessed as part of the MRCs per the Pricing Schedule. If the power requirements for Collocator’s

Attachment 12 - Collocation/AT&T-22STATE

Version: 4Q11 - CLEC ICA – 11/30/11
equipment exceed the capacity available, then such additional power requirements shall be assessed on an
individual case basis.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which AT&T-22STATE will furnish CLEC with
access to Unbundled Network Elements pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Telecommunications Act (herein
referred to as “251(c)(3) UNEs” or “UNEs”) for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act, Section
251(c)(3)) in AT&T-22STATE’s incumbent local Exchange areas.
1.2 Nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute consent by AT&T-22STATE that any item
identified in this Agreement as a UNE or network element is a network element or UNE under Section 251(c)(3) of
the Act, as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and effective FCC and judicial
orders, that AT&T-22STATE is required to provide to CLEC alone, or in combination with other network elements or
UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise), or commingled with other network elements, UNEs (251(c)(3) or otherwise) or other
services or facilities.
1.3 The preceding includes without limitation that AT&T-22STATE shall not be obligated to provide combinations
(whether considered new, pre-existing or existing) or other arrangements (including, where applicable, Commingled
Arrangements) involving AT&T-22STATE network elements that do not constitute 251(c)(3) UNEs, or where
251(c)(3) UNEs are not requested for permissible purposes.
1.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Amendment to this Agreement, including but not limited
to intervening law, change in law or other substantively similar provision in the Agreement or any Amendment, if an
element described as an Unbundled Network Element or 251(c)(3) UNE in this Agreement is Declassified or is
otherwise no longer a 251(c)(3) UNE, then the Transition Procedure defined in Section 3.5 below, shall govern.
1.5 Access to 251(c)(3) UNEs is provided under this Agreement over such routes, technologies, and facilities as AT&T-
22STATE may elect at its own discretion. AT&T-22STATE will provide access to 251(c)(3) UNEs where technically
feasible. Where facilities and equipment are not available, AT&T-22STATE shall not be required to provide 251(c)(3)
UNEs.
1.6 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC under the provisions of this Attachment shall remain the property of AT&T-
22STATE.
1.7 Subject to the terms herein, AT&T-22STATE is responsible only for the installation, operation and maintenance of
the 251(c)(3) UNEs it provides. AT&T-22STATE is not otherwise responsible for the Telecommunications Services
provided by CLEC through the use of those 251(c)(3) UNEs.
1.8 Where 251(c)(3) UNEs provided to CLEC are dedicated to a single End User, if such 251(c)(3) UNEs are for any
reason disconnected they shall be made available to AT&T-22STATE for future provisioning needs, unless such
251(c)(3) UNE is disconnected in error. The CLEC agrees to relinquish control of any such 251(c)(3) UNE
concurrent with the disconnection of a CLEC’s End User’s service.
1.9 The Parties intend that this Attachment contains the sole and exclusive terms and conditions by which CLEC will
obtain UNEs from AT&T-21STATE. Accordingly, except as may be specifically permitted by this Attachment, and
then only to the extent permitted, CLEC and its Affiliates hereby fully and irrevocably waive any right or ability any of
them might have to purchase any UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs (or
otherwise), with a network element possessed by CLEC, or pursuant to Commingling or otherwise) directly from any
AT&T-21STATE tariff, to the extent such tariff(s) is/are available, and agree not to so purchase or attempt to so
purchase from any such tariff. Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding
waiver, estoppel, laches, or similar concepts in other situations, the failure of AT&T-21STATE to enforce the
foregoing (including if AT&T-21STATE fails to reject or otherwise block orders for, or provides or continues to
provide, UNEs, or otherwise, under tariff) shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or
other similar concepts shall not act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder. At its option, AT&T-21STATE
may either reject any such order submitted under tariff, or without the need for any further contact with or consent
from CLEC, AT&T-21STATE may process any such order as being submitted under this Attachment and, further,
may convert any element provided under tariff, to this Attachment effective as of the later in time of (i) the Effective
Date of this Agreement, or (ii) the submission of the order by CLEC.
1.10 When an End User of CLEC elects to discontinue service and to transfer service to another local exchange carrier,
including AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE shall have the right to reuse the facilities provided to CLEC, regardless
of whether those facilities are provided as network elements or as part of a resold service, and regardless of whether
the End User served with such facilities has paid all charges to CLEC or has been denied service for nonpayment or

otherwise. AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC that such a request has been processed after the disconnect order has
been completed.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 AT&T-22STATE Premise(s) means as defined in Attachment 12 – Collocation.
2.2 “Building” or “same building” means a structure under one (1) roof or two (2) or more structures on one (1) premises
which are connected by an enclosed or covered passageway.
2.3 “Commingling” or “Commingled Arrangement” means an arrangement connecting, attaching, or otherwise linking of a
UNE, or a combination of UNEs, to one (1) or more facilities or services that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from
AT&T-22STATE, or the combining of a UNE, or a combination of UNEs, with one (1) or more such facilities or
services. Commingling in its entirety (the ability of CLEC to Commingle, AT&T-22STATE’s obligation to perform the
functions necessary to Commingle, and Commingled Arrangements) shall not apply to or otherwise include, involve
or encompass AT&T-22STATE offerings pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 271 that are not 251(c)(3) UNEs under 47 U.S.C. §
251(c)(3).
2.4 “Declassified UNE” or “Declassified” means a UNE that ceases to be a UNE under this Agreement because it is no
longer required by Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated
251(c)(3) and effective FCC and judicial orders.
2.5 “Demarcation Point” means the point on the loop where AT&T-22STATE’s control of the wire ceases and the End
User’s control (or in the case of some multi-unit premises, the landlord’s control) of the wire begins.
2.6 “Enhanced Extended Link (EEL)” means a 251(c)(3) UNE combination consisting of an Unbundled Local Loop(s) and
Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT), together with any facilities, equipment, or functions necessary to combine
those UNEs (including, for example, multiplexing capabilities) subject to the Cap limitations as identified within the
Unbundled Local Loop and Unbundled Transport sections below. A DS1 or higher EEL is required to terminate in a
Collocation arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.3.1 below of this Attachment (e.g., the end of the
UDT that is opposite the end connected to the 251(c)(3) UNE Local Loop, must be accessed by CLEC at such a
CLEC collocation arrangement via a cross-connect).
2.7 “Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) Loops” means local Loops consisting of fiber optic cable connecting to a copper
distribution plant that is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the End User’s premises or, in the case of
predominantly residential MDUs, not more than five hundred (500) feet from the MDU’s MPOE. The fiber optic cable
in a FTTC Loop must connect to a copper distribution plant at a serving area interface from which every other copper
distribution subloop also is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the respective End User’s premises.
2.8 “Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Loops” means local Loops consisting entirely of fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit,
serving an End User’s premises or, in the case of predominantly residential multiple dwelling units (MDUs), a fiber
optic cable, whether dark or lit, that extends to the MDU minimum point of entry (MPOE).
2.9 “Hybrid UNE Loop” means a Local UNE Loop composed of both fiber optic cable, usually in the feeder plant, and
copper twisted wire and cable, usually in the distribution plant. AT&T-22STATE shall provide CLEC access to Hybrid
UNE Loops pursuant to the requirements of 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(a)(2).
2.10 “Unbundled Local Loop(s) (UNE Loop)” means a transmission facility between a distribution frame (or its equivalent)
in an AT&T-22STATE central office and the UNE Loop Demarcation Point at an End User premises. Facilities that
do not terminate at a Demarcation Point at an End User premises, including, by way of example, but not limited to,
facilities that terminate to another carrier’s switch or premises, a cell site, mobile switching center or base station, do
not constitute UNE Loops. The UNE Loop includes all features, functions, and capabilities of the transmission
facilities, including the Network Interface Device, and attached electronics (except those used for the provision of
advanced services, such as Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs)), optronics and intermediate
devices (including repeaters and load coils) used to establish the transmission path to the End User’s premises,
including inside wire owned or controlled by AT&T-22STATE.
2.11 “Network Interface Device (NID)” means any interconnection of End User premises wiring to AT&T-22STATE’s
distribution UNE Loop facilities, such as a cross-connect device used for that purpose. Fundamentally, the NID
establishes the final (and official) network demarcation point between the UNE Loop and the End User’s inside wire.
2.12 “Ratcheting” means a pricing mechanism that involves billing a single circuit at multiple rates to develop a single,
blended rate.

Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
2.13 “Route” means a transmission path between one of AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Centers or switches and another of
AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Centers or switches. A Route between two points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire
Center or switch “Z”) may pass through one (1) or more intermediate Wire Centers or switches (e.g., Wire Center or
switch “X”). Transmission paths between identical end points (e.g., Wire Center or switch “A” and Wire Center or
switch “Z”) are the same Route, irrespective of whether they pass through the same intermediate Wire Centers or
switches, if any.
2.14 “Unbundled Dedicated Transport (UDT)” means AT&T-22STATE interoffice transmission facilities between Wire
Centers or switches owned by AT&T-22STATE, or between Wire Centers or switches owned by AT&T-22STATE
and switches owned by requesting Telecommunications Carriers, dedicated to a particular End User or carrier.
AT&T-22STATE is not obligated to provide CLEC with unbundled access to Dedicated Transport that does not
connect a pair of AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers.
2.15 “UNE Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber/Dark Fiber Transport” means AT&T-22STATE dark fiber interoffice
transmission facilities dedicated to a particular CLEC that are within AT&T-22STATE’s network, connecting AT&T-
22STATE switches or Wire Centers within a LATA. Dedicated Transport Dark Fiber consists of un-activated optical
interoffice transmission facilities.
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 The rates for UNEs, UNE Combinations and Other Services are set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
3.2 If CLEC procures any UNEs, UNE Combinations and/or Other Services for which rates are not currently in the Pricing
Schedule, AT&T-22STATE then reserves the right to charge a current state-specific price/market-based rate.
3.3 Without limitation, a UNE under this Agreement is Declassified upon or by (a) the issuance of an effective finding by
a court or regulatory agency acting within its authority that requesting Telecommunications Carriers are not impaired
without access to a particular UNE; or (b) an effective determination by a legislative, judicial or regulatory body
finding that an ILEC is not required, or is no longer required, to provide the UNE pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the
Act; or (c) the absence, by vacatur or otherwise, of a legally effective FCC rule requiring the provision of the UNE on
an unbundled basis pursuant to Section 251(c)(3). By way of example only, a UNE can be Declassified generally, or
on an element-specific, Route-specific or geographically-specific basis or on a class of elements basis. For
declassification of elements as the result of changes to Wire Center designations, Section 14.0 below shall apply.
3.4 If this Agreement requires or appears to require UNE(s) or the unbundling of an element without specifically noting a
particular UNE or UNEs, the reference shall be deemed to be a reference to 251(c )(3) UNE(s), as defined in this
Attachment. If a UNE is Declassified or is not required to be provided under this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment and/or
not described in this 251(c)(3) UNE Attachment, it is the Parties’ intent that the UNE is not available under this
Agreement, notwithstanding any reference to the UNE elsewhere in the Agreement, including in any other
Attachment, or in the Pricing Schedule.
3.5 Transition Procedure for UNEs that are Declassified during the Term of the Agreement:
3.5.1 The procedure set forth in this Section does not apply to the Declassification events described in Sections
8.1.4 below, Section 9.1.7 below which set forth the consequences for Declassification of DS1 and DS3
Loops, DS1 and DS3 Transport and Dark Fiber Transport, where applicable Caps are met, or where
Declassification occurs because Wire Centers/Routes meet the criteria set forth in the FCC’s TRO Remand
Order (TRRO).
3.5.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall only be obligated to provide Section 251 (c)(3) UNEs under this
Agreement as determined by 251(c)(3) and effective FCC rules and associated 251(c)(3) and
effective FCC and judicial orders. To the extent an element described as a UNE or an
Unbundled Network Element in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a UNE,
AT&T-22STATE may discontinue the provision of such element, whether previously provided
alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement with other UNEs or other
elements or services. Accordingly, in the event one (1) or more elements described as UNEs or
as Unbundled Network Elements in this Agreement is Declassified or is otherwise no longer a
UNE, AT&T-22STATE will identify such Declassified UNEs and provide written Notice to CLEC
of its discontinuance of the element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the
element(s) has been previously provided. During a “Transitional Period” of thirty (30) calendar
days from the date of such Notice, AT&T-22STATE agrees to continue providing such

Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-22STATE
Page 6 of 23
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
element(s) under the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of such written Notice, CLEC will
cease ordering elements that are identified as Declassified or as otherwise no longer being
available as a UNE in the AT&T-22STATE Notice letter. AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to
review CLEC’s orders transmitted to AT&T-22STATE and to the extent that CLEC has
processed orders and such orders are provisioned after the Transitional Period, such elements
are still subject to this Section, including the options set forth in (a) and (b) below, and AT&T-
22STATE’s rights of discontinuance or conversion in the event the options are not accomplished.
During the Transitional Period, the following options are available to CLEC with regard to the
element(s) identified in the AT&T-22STATE Notice, including the combination or other
arrangement in which the element(s) were previously provided:
3.5.1.1.1 CLEC may issue a Local Service Request (LSR) or Access Service Request
(ASR), as applicable, to seek disconnection or other discontinuance of the
element(s) and/or the combination or other arrangement in which the element(s)
were previously provided; or
3.5.1.1.2 AT&T-22STATE and CLEC may agree upon another service arrangement or
element (e.g., via a separate agreement at market-based rates to the extent AT&T-
22STATE offers such an agreement, or an equivalent tariffed AT&T-22STATE
service, or resale), or may agree that an analogous access product or service may
be substituted, if available.
3.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at
the end of that thirty (30) calendar day Transitional Period described in Section 3.5.1.1 above, unless CLEC
has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as applicable, under (a), above, and/or if CLEC
and AT&T-22STATE have failed to reach agreement under (b), above, as to a substitute service
arrangement or element, then AT&T-22STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect the element(s), whether
previously provided alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement, or convert the subject
element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other arrangement to an analogous
resale or access service, if available.
4.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
4.1 AT&T-22STATE will provide access to UNEs for the provision by CLEC of a Telecommunications Service (Act,
Section 251(c)(3).
4.2 Each Party shall be solely responsible for the services it provides to its End Users and to other Telecommunications
Carriers.
4.3 CLEC’s use of any AT&T-22STATE UNE, or of its own equipment or facilities in conjunction with any AT&T-
22STATE UNE, must not materially interfere with or impair service over any facilities of AT&T-22STATE, its affiliated
companies or its connecting and concurring carriers involved in its services, cause damage to their plant, impair the
privacy of any communications carried over their facilities or create hazards to the employees of any of them or the
public. Upon reasonable written Notice and opportunity to cure, AT&T-22STATE may discontinue or refuse service if
CLEC violates this provision, provided that such termination of service will be limited to CLEC’s use of the UNE(s)
causing the violation.
4.4 Where processes for any UNE provided pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or in conjunction with any other
UNE(s) or service(s), are not already in place, AT&T-22STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any
associated rates, terms and conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable change management guidelines
found on AT&T CLEC Online website.
4.5 Performance of UNEs:
4.5.1 Each UNE will be provided in accordance with AT&T-22STATE technical publications or other written
descriptions, if any, as changed from time to time by AT&T-22STATE at its sole discretion.
4.5.2 Nothing in this Attachment shall limit either Party’s ability to upgrade its network through the incorporation of
new equipment, new software or otherwise or to otherwise change and/or modify its network including,
without limitation, through the retirement and/or replacement of equipment, software or otherwise. Each
Party agrees to comply with the Network Disclosure rules adopted by the FCC in CC Docket No. 96-98,

Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-22STATE
Page 7 of 23
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
Second Report and Order, codified at 47 C.F.R. §§ 51.325 through 51.335, as such rules maybe amended
from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
4.5.3 AT&T-22STATE may elect to conduct upgrades or conversions for the improvement of its network or
systems. During such upgrades or conversions, CLEC orders for UNEs from affected Wire Center(s) may
be suspended for a period of a few days prior and one (1) day after the upgrade or conversion date,
consistent with the suspension AT&T-22STATE places on itself for orders from its End Users and other
CLEC’s End Users.
4.5.4 CLEC will be solely responsible, at its own expense, for the overall design of its Telecommunications
Services and for any redesigning or rearrangement of its Telecommunications Services that may be
required because of changes in facilities, operations, or procedure of AT&T-22STATE minimum network
protection criteria, or operating or maintenance characteristics of the facilities.
4.6 Conditions for Access to UNEs:
4.6.1 CLEC cannot use a UNE (whether on a stand-alone basis, in combination with other UNEs, or otherwise),
with a network element possessed by CLEC (or otherwise) to provide service to itself, or for other
administrative purpose(s).

6.1.3.5 CLEC is either unable to make the combination itself; or a new entrant and is unaware that it
needs to combine certain UNEs to provide a Telecommunications Service, but such obligation
under this Section ceases if AT&T-22STATE informs CLEC of such need to combine.
6.1.4 For purposes of Section 6.1.3.5 above and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
make a combination itself, CLEC is deemed able to make a combination itself when the UNE(s) sought to
be combined are available to CLEC, including without limitation on/at an AT&T-22STATE Premise, as
defined in the Attachment 12 - Collocation.
6.2 Conversion of Wholesale Services to 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combinations Or 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combinations to
Wholesale Services:
6.2.1 Upon request, AT&T-22STATE shall convert a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the
equivalent UNE/UNE combinations that is/are available to CLEC pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Act
and under this Agreement, or convert UNE/UNE combination(s) that is/are available to CLEC pursuant to
Section 251(c)(3) of the Act and under this Agreement to an equivalent wholesale service or group of
wholesale services offered by AT&T-22STATE (collectively “Conversion”).
6.2.2 A Conversion shall be considered termination for purposes of any volume and/or term commitments and/or
grandfathered status between CLEC and AT&T-22STATE.
6.2.3 AT&T-22STATE will not require physical rearrangements if the Conversion can be completed through
record changes only. Any change from a wholesale service/group of wholesale services to a 251(c)(3)
UNE/UNE combination(s), or from a 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE combination(s) to a wholesale service/group of
wholesale services that require a physical rearrangement will not be considered a Conversion for purposes
of this Agreement.
6.2.4 Orders for Conversions will be handled in accordance with the guidelines posted on AT&T CLEC Online
website.
6.2.5 Where processes for the Conversion requested pursuant to this Attachment are not already in place, the
Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum guidelines.
6.2.6 If CLEC does not meet the applicable eligibility criteria or, for any reason, stops meeting the eligibility criteria
for a particular Conversion of a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the equivalent
251(c)(3) UNE, or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, CLEC shall not request such Conversion or continue
using such 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNEs that result from such Conversion. To the extent CLEC fails to
meet (including ceases to meet) the eligibility criteria applicable to a 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of
251(c)(3) UNEs, AT&T-22STATE may convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or 251(c)(3) UNE combination to the
equivalent wholesale service or group of wholesale services, upon written Notice to CLEC.
6.2.6.1 This Section applies to any 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, including whether
or not such 251(c)(3) UNE or combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs had been previously converted
from an AT&T-22STATE service.
6.2.6.2 AT&T-22STATE may exercise its rights provided for hereunder and those allowed by law to
ensure compliance with any applicable eligibility criteria.
6.2.7 Conversion Pricing:
6.2.7.1 AT&T-22STATE shall charge the applicable non-recurring service order charge and applicable
switch-as-is rates as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, for Conversions to specific UNE/UNE
Combinations. AT&T-22STATE shall also charge the applicable non-recurring service order

charge and applicable switch-as-is rates, as set forth in the Pricing Schedule, when converting
from UNE/UNE combinations.
6.3 Commingling:
6.3.1 Commingling is not permitted, nor is AT&T-22STATE required to perform the functions necessary to
Commingle, where the Commingled Arrangement (i) is not technically feasible, including that network
reliability and security would be impaired; or (ii) would impair AT&T-22STATE’s ability to retain responsibility
for the management, control, and performance of its network; or (iii) would place AT&T-22STATE at a
disadvantage in operating its own network; or (iv) would undermine the ability of other Telecommunications
Carriers to obtain access to UNEs or to Interconnect with AT&T-22STATE’s network.
6.3.2 Where processes for any Commingling requested pursuant to this Agreement (including, by way of
example, for existing services sought to be converted to a Commingled Arrangement) are not already in
place, AT&T-22STATE will develop and implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and
conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable change management or CLEC User Forum (CUF)
guidelines and/or will be developed pursuant to the BFR process.
6.3.3 Any Commingling obligation is limited solely to Commingling of one (1) or more facilities or services that are
provided at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE with UNEs; accordingly, no other facilities, services or
functionalities are subject to Commingling, including but not limited to facilities, services or functionalities
that AT&T-22STATE might offer pursuant to Section 271 of the Act.
6.3.4 Except as provided in Section 6.3 above and, further, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
AT&T-22STATE shall permit CLEC to Commingle a UNE or a combination of UNEs with facilities or
services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE to the extent required by effective FCC rules and
associated and effective FCC and judicial orders.
6.3.5 Upon request, and subject to Section 6, AT&T-22STATE shall perform the functions necessary to
Commingle a 251(c)(3) UNE or a combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs with one (1) or more facilities or services
that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE (as well as requests where CLEC also wants
AT&T-22STATE to complete the actual Commingling), except that AT&T-22STATE shall have no obligation
to perform the functions necessary to Commingle (or to complete the actual Commingling) if (i) Section 6.2.1
above applies to the Commingled Arrangement sought by CLEC; or (ii) the CLEC is able to perform those
functions itself. Where CLEC is a new entrant and is unaware that it needs to Commingle to provide a
Telecommunications Service, AT&T-22STATE’s obligation to Commingle ceases if AT&T-22STATE
informs CLEC of such need to Commingle.
6.3.6 For purposes of Section 6.3.1 above and without limiting other instances in which CLEC may be able to
Commingle for itself, CLEC is deemed able to Commingle for itself when the UNE(s), UNE combination, and
facilities or services obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE are available to CLEC at the CLEC’s
Collocation Arrangement. For Collocation terms and conditions see Attachment 12 – Collocation.
6.3.7 AT&T-22STATE has developed a list of Commingled Arrangements that will be available for ordering. This
list is posted on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
6.3.7.1 Any request by CLEC for a Commingled Arrangement not included in such list may be made via
Attachment 08 - Bona Fide Request. In any such BFR, CLEC must designate among other
things the 251(c)(3) UNE(s), combination of 251(c)(3) UNEs, and the facilities or services that
CLEC has obtained at wholesale from AT&T-22STATE sought to be Commingled and the
needed location(s), the order in which such 251(c)(3) UNEs, such combinations of 251(c)(3)
UNEs, and such facilities and services are to be Commingled, and how each connection (e.g.,
cross-connected) is to be made between them.
6.3.8 AT&T-22STATE will charge the appropriate recurring and non-recurring rates as identified in the Pricing
Schedule. AT&T-22STATE shall charge the appropriate non-recurring rates as set forth in the Pricing
Schedule(s) applicable to the 251(c)(3) UNEs (or 251(c)(3) UNE combinations) that are Commingled on a
251(c)(3) UNE-by-251(c)(3) UNE basis, and for the facilities and services that are Commingled (under this
Section 6.3 above) on a facility-by-facility, service-by-service basis, including without limitation for the type
of service and activity being requested to create the Commingled Arrangement.

sought:
6.4.2.1 The following criteria are satisfied for each Included Arrangement, including without limitation
each DS1 circuit, each DS3 circuit, each DS1 EEL and each DS1 equivalent circuit on a DS3
EEL:
6.4.2.1.1 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be assigned a local telephone
number (NPA-NXX-XXXX) that is associated with local service provided within an
AT&T-22STATE local service area and within the LATA where the circuit is located
(“Local Telephone Number”), prior to the provision of service over that circuit (and
for each circuit, CLEC will provide the corresponding Local Telephone Number(s)
as part of the required certification); and
6.4.2.1.2 Each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 EEL or on any other Included Arrangement,
must have its own Local Telephone Number assignment, so that each DS3 must
have at least twenty-eight (28) Local voice Telephone Numbers assigned to it; and
6.4.2.1.3 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will have 911 or E911 capability prior
to the provision of service over that circuit; and
6.4.2.1.4 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will terminate in a Collocation
arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.3 below of this
Attachment; and
6.4.2.1.5 Each circuit to be provided to each End User will be served by an Interconnection
Trunk that meets the requirements of Section 6.4.4 below of this Attachment; and

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
6.4.3 A Collocation arrangement meets the requirements of Section 6.4 above of this Attachment if it is:
6.4.3.1 Established pursuant to Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and located at AT&T-22STATE Premises
within the same LATA as the End User’s premises, when AT&T-22STATE is not the Collocator;
or
6.4.3.2 Located at a Third Party’s premises within the same LATA as the End User’s premises, when
AT&T-22STATE is the Collocator.
6.4.4 An Interconnection Trunk meets the requirements of Section 6.4.2.1.5 above and Section 6.4.2.1.6 above of
this Attachment if CLEC will transmit the calling party’s local telephone number in connection with calls
exchanged over the Trunk, and the Trunk is located in the same LATA as the End User premises served by
the Included Arrangement.
6.4.5 For a new circuit to which Section 6.4.2 above applies, CLEC may initiate the ordering process if CLEC
certifies that it will not begin to provide any service over that circuit until a local telephone number is
assigned and 911/E911 capability is provided, as required by Section 6.4.2.1.1 above and Section 6.4.2.1.3
above respectively. In such case, CLEC shall satisfy Section 6.4.2.1.1 above and/or Section 6.4.2.1.3
above if it assigns the required Local Telephone Number(s), and implements 911/E911 capability, within
thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE provisions such new circuit. CLEC must provide AT&T-
22STATE with sufficient proof that such assignment and/or implementation has occurred by the end of such
thirtieth (30th) day.
6.4.5.1 Section 6.4.5 above does not apply to existing circuits to which Section 6.4.2 above applies,
including Conversions or migrations (e.g., CLEC shall not be excused from meeting the Section
6.4.2.1.1 above and Section 6.4.2.1.3 above requirements for existing circuits at the time it
initiates the ordering process).
6.4.6 CLEC hereby agrees that by submitting an order to AT&T-22STATE for an Included Arrangement (whether
new, as a result of a requested Conversion, or otherwise), CLEC is certifying that it meets and will continue
to meet the requirements of Section 6.4 above as to such Included Arrangement(s) on a circuit-by-
circuit/service-by-service/Included Arrangement-by-Included Arrangement basis. Such certification-by-order
shall have the same weight and effect as a separate certification, and certification-by-order shall not
diminish or otherwise affect CLEC’s obligation to meet and to continue to comply with the criteria or
certification requirements set forth in this Section.
6.4.6.1 If the information previously provided in a certification is inaccurate (or ceases to be accurate),
CLEC shall update such certification promptly with AT&T-22STATE.
6.4.7 In addition to any other audit rights provided for this Agreement and those allowed by law, AT&T-22STATE
may obtain and pay for an independent auditor to audit CLEC, on an annual basis, applied on a State-by-
State basis, for compliance with this Section. For purposes of calculating and applying an “annual basis”, it
means a consecutive twelve (12) month period for each individual State, beginning upon AT&T-22STATE’s
written Notice that an audit will be performed for that State, subject to Section 6.4.7.4 below.
6.4.7.1 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties (including at the time of the audit), the independent
auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the standards established by the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which will require the auditor to
perform an “examination engagement” and issue an opinion regarding CLEC’s compliance with
the qualifying service eligibility criteria.
6.4.7.2 The independent auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all material respects
with this Section 6.4 above.
6.4.7.3 Consistent with standard auditing practices, such audits require compliance testing designed by
the independent auditor, which typically includes an examination of a sample selected in
accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment.
6.4.7.4 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with this
Section 6.4 above, CLEC must true-up any difference in payments beginning from the date that
the non-compliant circuit was established as a 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combination, in whole or in

Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-22STATE
Page 12 of 23
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
part (notwithstanding any other provision hereof), CLEC must convert the 251(c)(3) UNE or
251(c)(3) UNE Combination, or Commingled Arrangement, to an equivalent or substantially
similar wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, (and AT&T-22STATE may initiate and
affect such a conversion on its own without any further consent by CLEC), and CLEC shall timely
make the correct payments on a going-forward basis, and all applicable remedies for failure to
make such payments shall be available to AT&T-22STATE. In no event shall rates set under
Section 252(d)(1) of the Act apply for the use of any 251(c)(3) UNE for any period in which CLEC
does not meet the conditions set forth in this Section 6.4 above for that 251(c)(3) UNE,
arrangement, or circuit, as the case may be. Also, the “annual basis” calculation and application
shall be immediately reset, (e.g., AT&T-22STATE shall not have to wait the remaining part of the
consecutive twelve (12) month period before it is permitted to audit again in that state).
6.4.7.4.1 To the extent that the independent auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to
comply in all material respects with this Section 6.4 above, CLEC must reimburse
AT&T-22STATE for the cost of the independent auditor and for AT&T-22STATE’s
costs in the same manner and using the same methodology and rates that AT&T-
22STATE is required to pay CLEC’s costs under Section 6.4.7.4.2 below.
6.4.7.4.2 To the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that the CLEC complied in
all material respects with this Section 6.4 above, AT&T-22STATE must reimburse
CLEC for its reasonable staff time and other reasonable costs associated in
responding to the audit (e.g., collecting data in response to the auditor’s inquiries,
meeting for interviews, etc.).
6.4.7.5 CLEC will maintain the appropriate documentation to support its eligibility certifications including,
without limitation, call detail records, local telephone number assignment documentation, and
switch assignment documentation.
6.4.8 Without affecting the application or interpretation of any other provisions regarding waiver, estoppel, laches,
or similar concepts in other situations, CLEC shall fully comply with this Section in all cases and, further, the
failure of AT&T-22STATE to require such compliance, including if AT&T-22STATE provides a circuit(s), an
EEL(s), or a Commingled circuit, that does not meet any eligibility criteria, including those in this Section,
shall not act as a waiver of any part of this Section, and estoppel, laches, or other similar concepts shall not
act to affect any rights or requirements hereunder.
7.0 Network Interface Device (NID)
7.1.1 Subject to Section 3.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE shall provide unbundled access to the
Unbundled Network Interface Device (NID) under the following terms and conditions in this subsection.
7.1.2 The Maintenance and control of the End User’s inside wiring (on the End User’s side of the UNE NID) is
under the control of the End User. Conflicts between telephone service providers for access to the End
User’s inside wire must be resolved by the End User. Pursuant to applicable FCC rules, AT&T-22STATE
offers nondiscriminatory access to the NID on an unbundled basis to CLEC for the provision of a
Telecommunications Service. In AT&T CONNECTICUT only, the CLEC access to the NID is offered as
specified in the AT&T CONNECTICUT tariff.
7.1.3 AT&T-21STATE will permit CLEC to connect its UNE Loop facilities to an End User’s premises wiring
through AT&T-21STATE’s NID, or at any other technically feasible point.
7.1.4 Any repairs, upgrade and rearrangements to the NID required by CLEC will be performed by AT&T-
21STATE based on Time and Material charges. AT&T-21STATE, at the request of CLEC, will disconnect
the AT&T-21STATE UNE Loop from the NID at charges reflected in the Pricing Schedule.
7.1.5 With respect to multiple dwelling units or multiple-unit business premises, CLEC will connect directly with
the End User’s premises wire, or may connect with the End User’s premises wire via AT&T-21STATE’s NID
where necessary.
7.1.6 The AT&T-21STATE NIDs that CLEC uses under this Attachment will be existing NIDs installed by AT&T-
21STATE to serve its End Users.

7.1.7 CLEC shall not attach to or disconnect AT&T-21STATE’s ground. CLEC shall not cut or disconnect AT&T-
21STATE’s UNE Loop from the NID and/or its protector. CLEC shall not cut any other leads in the UNE
NID.
7.1.8 CLEC, when it has constructed its own NID at a premises and needs only to make contact with AT&T-
21STATE’s NID, can disconnect the End User’s wiring from AT&T-21STATE’s NID and reconnect it to
CLEC’s NID.
8.0 UNE Loop
8.1.1 Subject to Section 3.0 above of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE shall provide unbundled access to UNE
Loops under the terms and conditions in this subsection.
8.1.2 Consistent with the applicable FCC rules, AT&T-22STATE will make available the UNE Loops set forth
herein below between a distribution frame (or its equivalent) in an AT&T-22STATE central office and the
UNE Loop demarcation point at an End User premises. The Parties acknowledge and agree that AT&T-
22STATE shall not be obligated to provision any of the UNE Loops provided for herein to cellular sites or to
any other location that does not constitute an End User premises. Where applicable, the UNE Loop
includes all wire within multiple dwelling and tenant Buildings and campuses that provides access to End
User premises wiring, provided such wire is owned and controlled by AT&T-22STATE. The UNE Loop
includes, but is not limited to copper UNE Loops (two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade copper UNE
Loops, digital copper UNE Loops [e.g., DS0s and integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines]), as well
as two-wire and four-wire copper UNE Loops conditioned, at CLEC’s request and subject to charges, to
transmit the digital signals needed to provide digital subscriber line services, DS1 Digital UNE Loops (where
they have not been Declassified and subject to Caps set forth in Section 8.1.3.4.4 below) and DS3 Digital
UNE Loops (where they have not been Declassified and subject to Caps set forth in Section 8.1.3.5.4
below) where such UNE Loops are deployed and available in AT&T-22STATE Wire Centers. CLEC agrees
to operate each UNE Loop type within applicable technical standards and parameters.
8.1.2.1 When a UNE Local Loop is ordered to a high voltage area, the Parties understand and agree
that such UNE Loop will require High Voltage Protective Equipment (HVPE) (e.g., a positron), to
ensure the safety and integrity of the network, the Parties’ employees and/or representatives,
and CLEC’s End User. Therefore, any request by CLEC for a UNE Loop to a high voltage area
will be submitted by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE via the BFR process set forth in Attachment 08 –
Bona Fide Request, and CLEC shall be required to pay AT&T-22STATE for any HVPE that is
provisioned by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC in connection with CLEC’s UNE Local Loop order to
the high voltage area.
8.1.3 The following types of UNE Loops will be provided at the rates, terms, and conditions set forth in this
Attachment, Pricing Schedule or for AT&T CONNECTICUT only, the tariff.
8.1.3.1 AT&T-21STATE 2-Wire Analog UNE Loop (Unbundled Voice Loop)
8.1.3.1.1 2-Wire Analog UNE Loop is a transmission facility that supports analog voice
frequency, voice band services with UNE Loop start signaling within the frequency
spectrum of approximately 300 Hz and 3000 Hz.
8.1.3.1.2 If CLEC requests one (1) or more 2-Wire Analog UNE Loops serviced by Integrated
Digital Loop Carrier (IDLC), AT&T-21STATE will, where available, move the
requested UNE Loop(s) to a spare, existing all-copper UNE Local Loop at no
additional charge to CLEC. If, however, no spare UNE Local Loop is available, as
defined above, AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the lack of available facilities.

11.0 Routine Network Modifications for UNE Loops, UNE DS1, DS3 and Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport
11.1.1 AT&T-22STATE shall make Routine Network Modifications (RNM) to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and
Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport facilities used by CLEC where the requested UNE facility has already been
constructed. AT&T-22STATE shall perform RNM to UNE Loop and UNE DS1, DS3, and Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without regard to whether the UNE facility
being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
11.1.2 A “Routine Network Modification” is an activity that AT&T regularly undertakes for its own customers. RNM
include rearranging or splicing of existing cable; adding an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater;
adding a smart jack; installing a repeater shelf; adding a line card; deploying a new multiplexer or
reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and attaching electronic and other equipment that AT&T-22STATE
ordinarily attaches to activate such UNE Loops or Transport facilities for its own retail End Users, under the
same conditions and in the same manner that AT&T-22STATE does for its own End Users. RNM may
entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable and installing
equipment casings. AT&T-22STATE will place drops in the same manner as it does for its own End Users.
11.1.3 RNM do not include constructing new UNE Loops; or UNE DS1, DS3, or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport;
installing new cable or fiber; securing permits or rights-of-way; constructing and/or placing new manholes or
conduits; installing new terminals; or removing or reconfiguring packetized transmission facility. Nor do
RNM include the provision of electronics for the purpose of lighting dark fiber (i.e., optronics). AT&T-
22STATE is not obligated to perform those activities for CLEC.
11.1.4 AT&T-22STATE shall determine whether and how to perform RNM using the same network or outside plant
engineering principles that would be applied in providing service to AT&T-22STATE’s retail End Users.
11.1.5 AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to build Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) capability into new packet-
based networks or into existing packet-based networks that never had TDM capability.
11.1.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, AT&T-22STATE’s obligations with respect to RNM apply
only where the UNE Loop and Transport transmission facilities are subject to unbundling and do not apply to
FTTH UNE Loops or FTTC UNE Loops.
11.1.7 AT&T-22STATE shall provide RNM at the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this Attachment and in the
Pricing Schedule or at rates to be determined on an individual case basis (ICB) or through the Special
Construction (SC) process. AT&T-22STATE will impose charges for RNM in instances where such charges
are not included in any costs already recovered through existing, applicable recurring and non-recurring
charges. The Parties agree that the RNM for which AT&T-22STATE is not recovering costs in existing
recurring and non-recurring charges, and for which costs will be imposed on CLEC as an ICB/SC include,
but are not limited to: (i) adding an equipment case, (ii) adding a doubler or repeater including associated
line card(s), (iii) installing a repeater shelf, and any other necessary work and parts associated with a
repeater shelf, and (iv) where applicable, deploying multiplexing equipment, to the extent such equipment is
not present on the UNE Loop or Transport facility when ordered.

14.0 Non-Impaired Wire Center Criteria and Related Processes
14.1 AT&T-22STATE has designated and posted, to AT&T CLEC Online website, the Wire Centers where it contends the
thresholds for DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity UNE Loops (as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4) and
Rule 51.319(a)(5) and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Non-Impaired Wire Centers as defined pursuant to Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i)
and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii)) have been met.
14.2 Commission-approved Wire Center Lists:
14.2.1 In states where the Commission has already determined that a Wire Center is properly designated as a
Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule 51.319(a)(5), Rule
51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), CLEC may no longer self-certify or request DS1/DS3 High-
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
declassified by the non-impairment status of the Wire Center in such Wire Center.
14.3 Wire Center Lists Pending Commission Approval:
14.3.1 In states where the Commission has not previously determined, in any proceeding, that a Wire Center is
properly designated as a Wire Center meeting the thresholds set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii), AT&T-22STATE’s designations shall be treated
as controlling (even if CLEC believes the list is inaccurate) for purposes of transition and ordering unless
CLEC provides a self-certification as outlined below. If a CLEC withdraws its self-certification after a dispute
has been filed with the Commission, but before the Commission has made a determination regarding the
wire center designation, the wire center designation(s) that were the subject of the dispute will be treated as
though the Commission approved AT&T-22STATE’s designations.
14.4 Self-Certifications:
14.4.1 CLEC shall perform a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine whether, to the best of CLEC’s knowledge,
the Wire Center meets the non-impairment thresholds as set forth pursuant to Rule 51.319(a)(4), Rule
51.319(a)(5), Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) and Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii).
14.4.2 If, based on its reasonably diligent inquiry, the CLEC disputes the AT&T-22STATE Wire Center non-
impairment designation, the CLEC will provide a self-certification to AT&T-22STATE identifying the Wire
Center(s) for which it is self-certifying. To self-certify, CLEC can send a letter to AT&T-22STATE claiming
Self Certification or CLEC may elect to self-certify using a written or electronic notification sent to AT&T-
22STATE.
14.4.3 If CLEC makes such a self-certification, and CLEC is otherwise entitled to the ordered element under the
Agreement, then AT&T-22STATE shall provision the requested facilities in accordance with CLEC’s order
and within AT&T-22STATE’s standard ordering interval applicable to such facilities.
14.4.4 If AT&T-22STATE in error rejects CLEC orders, where CLEC has provided self certification in accordance
with this Section of this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE will modify its systems to accept such orders within
five (5) business hours of CLEC notification to its Local Service Specialist.
14.4.5 CLEC may not submit a self-certification for a Wire Center after the transition period for the DS1/DS3 UNE
Loops and/or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport impacted by the
designation of the Wire Center has passed.
14.5 CLEC may not self-certify that it is entitled to obtain Unbundled DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or Unbundled DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport at a location where CLEC has met the volume Cap set forth in Sections 8.1.3.4.4 above and
8.1.3.5.4 above (for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops) and 9.1.6.3 above and 9.1.6.2 above (for DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport).
14.6 Until CLEC provides a self-certification for High-Capacity UNE Loops and/or Transport for such Wire Center
designations, CLEC will not submit High Capacity UNE Loop and/or Transport orders based on the Wire Center
designation, and if no self-certification is provided will transition any remaining Embedded Base of DS1 and DS3
UNE Loop and Transport and Dark Fiber Transport arrangements affected by the designation by disconnecting or
transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within thirty (30) calendar days of executing this
Agreement. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or arrangement within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning billing CLEC the equivalent special
access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the Transitional Rates.

14.7 AT&T-22STATE will update the AT&T CLEC Online website posted list and will advise CLECs of such posting via
Accessible Letter, which term for the purposes of this Section above of this Agreement shall be deemed to mean an
Accessible Letter issued after the Effective Date of this Agreement, as set forth in this Section 14.0 above of this
Agreement.
14.8 If it desires to do so, AT&T-22STATE can dispute the self-certification and associated CLEC orders for facilities
pursuant to the following procedures:
14.8.1 AT&T-22STATE will notify the CLEC of its intent to dispute the CLEC’s self-certification within thirty (30)
calendar days of the CLEC’s self-certification or within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date of this
Agreement, whichever is later.
14.8.2 AT&T-22STATE will file the dispute for resolution with the state Commission within sixty (60) calendar days
of the CLEC’s self-certification or within sixty (60) calendar days of the Effective Date of this Agreement,
whichever is later.
14.8.3 AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC of the filing of such a dispute via Accessible Letter.
14.8.4 If the self-certification dispute is filed with the state Commission for resolution, the Parties will not oppose
requests for intervention by other CLECs if such request is related to the disputed Wire Center
designation(s). The Parties agree to urge the state Commission to adopt a case schedule resulting in the
prompt resolution of the dispute.
14.9 During the timeframe of any dispute resolution proceeding, AT&T-22STATE shall continue to provide the High-
Capacity UNE Loop or Transport facility in question to CLEC at the rates in the Pricing Schedule.
14.10 If CLEC withdraws its self-certification, or if the state Commission determines through arbitration or otherwise that
CLEC was not entitled to the provisioned DS1/DS3 UNE Loops or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport under Section 251, the rates paid by CLEC for the affected UNE Loop or Transport shall be
subject to true-up as follows:
14.10.1 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-22STATE prior to March 11, 2005 and
14.10.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed prior to March 11, 2005,
14.10.2.1 CLEC will provide a true-up calculated using a beginning date of March 11, 2005 based on the
FCC transitional rates which are the rates in effect at the time of the non-impairment
designations plus fifteen percent (15%) (“Transitional Rates”). If affected UNE Loops/Transport
element(s) remain in place after the end of the initial TRRO transition period, CLEC will also
provide a true-up for the period after the end of initial TRRO transition period calculated using
the equivalent special access rates during the period between the end of the initial transition
period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no equivalent special access rate exists,
a true-up will be determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access rate/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply until the facility has
been transitioned.
14.10.2.2 For the affected UNE Loop/Transport element(s) installed after March 11, 2005, CLEC will
provide a true-up to an equivalent special access rate as of the later of the date billing began for
the provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of non-
impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined using the
Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special access rate/Transitional Rates will
continue to apply until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3 For Wire Centers designated by AT&T-22STATE after March 11, 2005:
14.10.2.3.1 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered before AT&T-22STATE’s Wire
Center designation,
14.10.2.3.1.1 if the applicable transition period is within the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 15.0 below of this Agreement, CLEC will
provide a true-up during the period between the date that is thirty (30)
calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and
the date the circuit is transitioned to the Transitional Rates.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
14.10.2.3.1.2 if the applicable transition period is after the initial TRRO transition
period described in Section 14.1 above of this Agreement has
expired, CLEC will provide a true-up based on the Transitional Rates
between the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-
22STATE’s Notice of non-impairment and the end of the applicable
transition period described in Section 15.1 below and the equivalent
special access rates during the period between the end of the initial
transition period and the date the circuit is actually transitioned. If no
equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be determined
using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates as described above will continue to apply
until the facility has been transitioned.
14.10.2.3.2 For affected UNE Loop/Transport elements ordered after AT&T-22STATE’s Wire
Center designation, CLEC will provide a true-up for the affected UNE
Loop/Transport element(s) to an equivalent special access rate for the affected
UNE Loop/Transport element(s) as of the later of the date billing began for the
provisioned element or thirty (30) calendar days after AT&T-22STATE’s Notice of
non-impairment. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be
determined using the Transitional Rates. The applicable equivalent special
access/Transitional Rates will continue to apply until the facility has been
transitioned.
14.10.3 In the event of a dispute following CLEC’s Self-Certification, upon request by the Commission or CLEC,
AT&T-22STATE will make available, subject to the appropriate state or federal protective order, and other
reasonable safeguards, all documentation and all data upon which AT&T-22STATE intends to rely, which
will include the detailed business line information for the AT&T-22STATE Wire Center or centers that are
the subject of the dispute.
15.0 Future Wire Center Designations
15.1 The parties recognize that Wire Centers that AT&T-22STATE had not designated as meeting the FCC’s non-
impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005, may meet those thresholds in the future. In the event that a Wire
Center that is not currently designated as meeting one (1) or more of the FCC’s non-impairment thresholds, meets
one (1) or more of these thresholds at a later date, AT&T-22STATE may add the Wire Center to the list of
designated Wire Centers and the Parties will use the following process:
15.1.1 AT&T-22STATE may update the Wire Center list as changes occur.
15.1.2 To designate a Wire Center that had previously not met one (1) or more of the FCC’s impairment thresholds
but subsequently does so, AT&T-22STATE will provide notification to CLEC via Accessible Letter and by a
posting on AT&T CLEC Online website.
15.1.3 AT&T-22STATE will continue to accept CLEC orders for impacted DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport without requiring CLEC self-certification for
thirty (30) calendar days after the date the Accessible Letter is issued.
15.1.4 In the event the CLEC disagrees with AT&T-22STATE’s determination, CLEC will have sixty (60) calendar
days from the issuance of the Accessible Letter to dispute AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Center determination by
providing a self-certification to AT&T-22STATE.
15.1.5 If the CLEC does not use the self-certification process described in Section 15.1.4 above to self-certify
against AT&T-22STATE’s Wire Center designation within sixty (60) calendar days of the issuance of the
Accessible Letter, CLEC must transition all circuits that have been declassified by the Wire Center
designation(s) by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, within
thirty (30) calendar days ending on the ninetieth (90th) day after the issuance of the Accessible Letter
providing the Wire Center designation of non-impairment; no additional notification from AT&T-22STATE
will be required. CLEC may not obtain new DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or
Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport in Wire Centers and/or Routes where such circuits have been declassified
during the applicable transition period. If CLEC fails to disconnect or transition to an alternate facility or

Attachment 13 - 251(c)(3) UNEs/AT&T-22STATE
Page 23 of 23
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 4Q10 - CLEC ICA - 11/19/10
arrangement within such thirty (30) day period, AT&T-22STATE may disconnect such circuits or beginning
billing CLEC the equivalent special access rate. If no equivalent special access rate exists, a true-up will be
determined using the transitional rates set forth in Section 15.2 below.
15.1.6 If CLEC does provide self-certification to dispute AT&T-22STATE’s designation determination within sixty
(60) calendar days of the issuance of the Accessible Letter, AT&T-22STATE may dispute CLEC’s self-
certification as described in Section 14.8 above of this Agreement and AT&T-22STATE will accept and
provision the applicable UNE Loop and Transport orders for the CLEC providing the self certification during
a dispute resolution process.
15.2 During the applicable transition period, the transition rates paid will be rates in effect at the time of the non-
impairment designations plus fifteen percent (15%).
16.0 Transition Procedures of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport Arrangements Impacted by Wire Center Designation(s)
16.1 The provisions of Section 14.1 above of this Attachment shall apply to the transition of DS1/DS3 UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements impacted by Wire Center
designation(s). As outlined in Section 14.1 above of this Attachment, requested transitions of DS1/DS3 High
Capacity UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall be
performed in a manner that reasonably minimizes the disruption or degradation to CLEC’s End User’s service, and all
applicable charges shall apply. Cross-connects provided by AT&T-22STATE in conjunction with such UNE Loops
and/or Transport shall be billed at applicable wholesale rates (e.g., prior to transition, cross connects will be billed at
transitional rates, after transition, if conversion is to an access product, cross connects will be billed at applicable
access rates). Cross-connects that are not associated with such transitioned DS1/DS3 High-Capacity UNE Loops,
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall not be re-priced.
16.2 AT&T-22STATE will process CLEC orders for DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport, or Dark Fiber
Transport conversion or disconnection. AT&T-22STATE will not convert or disconnect these services prior to the
end of the applicable transitional period unless specifically requested by the CLEC; however, CLEC is responsible for
ensuring that it submits timely orders in order to complete the transition by the end of applicable transitional period in
an orderly manner.
16.3 A Building that is served by both an impaired Wire Center and a non impaired Wire Center and that is not located in
the serving area for the non-impaired Wire Center will continue to have affected elements available from the impaired
Wire Center and support incremental moves, adds, and changes otherwise permitted by the Agreement, as
amended.
16.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to this Agreement, at the end
of the applicable transitional period, unless CLEC has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance LSR or ASR, as
applicable, under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement, and if CLEC and AT&T-22STATE have failed to reach
agreement under Section 14.4.1 above of this Agreement as to a substitute service arrangement or element, then
AT&T-22STATE may, at its sole option, disconnect DS1/DS3 UNE Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark
Fiber Dedicated Transport, whether previously provided alone or in combination with or as part of any other
arrangement, or convert the subject element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of any other
arrangement to an analogous resale or access service, if available, at rates applicable to such analogous service or
arrangement.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 AT&T-21STATE will make available xDSL Loops and xDSL/Unbundled Copper Subloop (UCSL) Subloops for the
provision of xDSL-based services or line splitting arrangements provided by CLEC in accordance with the FCC’s
Triennial Review Order and associated lawful and effective implementing rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(i)-(iv) and
(b)(1), as such rules may be modified from time to time.
2.0 General Provisions
2.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide xDSL Loops and xDSL/UCSL Subloops for CLEC to deploy xDSL technologies
presumed acceptable for deployment or non-standard xDSL technologies as defined in this Agreement and as
provided for under the applicable lawful and effective FCC rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.230, as such rule may be modified
from time to time.
2.2 AT&T-21STATE will not guarantee that an xDSL Loop or xDSL/UCSL Subloops ordered by CLEC will perform as
desired by CLEC for xDSL based services, but will guarantee that Loops will be provisioned to meet basic metallic
Loop parameters, including continuity and pair balance. CLEC shall designate on its Local Service Request (LSR),
at CLEC’s sole option, what Loop conditioning AT&T-21STATE is to perform in provisioning the order.
2.3 The Parties shall comply with the FCC’s lawful and effective spectrum management rules, 47 C.F.R. §51.231-233, as
such rules may be modified from time to time. Refer to AT&T CLEC Online website for specific processes addressing
Spectrum Management.
2.4 Maintenance, Repair and Testing:
2.4.1 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Maintenance Repair and Testing in accordance with the lawful and effective
requirements of 47 C.F.R. §51.319(a)(1)(iv) and as outlined on the AT&T CLEC Online website and within
Attachment 07 - Operations Support Systems (OSS).
2.4.2 Line and Station Transfer (LST): For a loop currently in service where trouble ticket resolution has identified
that excessive bridged tap(s), load coil(s) and/or repeater(s) are on the loop and transferring to a new loop
is a solution identified by AT&T-12STATE to resolve a trouble, AT&T-12STATE, at its sole option, may
perform an LST to resolve the identified trouble. In the event that a request for conditioning is received from
the CLEC on a loop currently in service and AT&T-12STATE determines that an LST can be performed, the
AT&T-12STATE LOC will contact the CLEC to inform it of the decision to perform an LST in lieu of CLEC’s
requested conditioning. In such case, the charge for the LST set forth in the Pricing Schedule shall apply in
lieu of any loop conditioning charges which would have applied had the requested conditioning been
performed. If, however, the LST does not resolve the reported trouble and the trouble is determined to be
an AT&T-12STATE network-related problem, then CLEC will not be charged the LST rate or for AT&T-
12STATE’s resolution of the trouble. If, however, the trouble is found not to be an AT&T-12STATE network-
related problem, then CLEC shall pay the Maintenance of Service charges referenced in the Pricing
Schedule, in addition to the applicable LST charge.
3.0 Product Specific Service Delivery Provisions
3.1 Loop Makeup Information and Ordering:
3.1.1 At the CLEC’s request, AT&T-21STATE will provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to its Loop

3.3.2 All modifications for Loop Conditioning/Line Conditioning in this section will be performed at the rates set
forth in the Pricing Schedule.
3.3.3 AT&T-21STATE shall provide Line Conditioning on 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops, as requested by CLEC,
even in instances where AT&T-21STATE does not provide advanced services to the End User on that
251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop.
3.3.4 AT&T-21STATE will not modify a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop in such a way that it no longer meets the
technical parameters of the original 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop type e.g., voice grade, etc., being ordered.
3.3.5 In AT&T-12STATE (i) If load coils, repeaters or excessive bridged tap are present on a loop less than
12,000 feet in actual loop length, conditioning to remove these elements will be performed without request;
(ii) if the loop qualification indicates conditioning is available on a loop that is 12,000 feet in actual loop
length or greater, CLEC may request that no conditioning be performed or that AT&T-12STATE perform
some or all of the available loop conditioning to remove excessive bridged tap, load coils and/or repeaters at
the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may obtain loop conditioning information according to the
terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online website; incorporated herein by reference, as
may be modified from time to time.
3.3.6 AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE will remove load coils only on copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops
that are equal to or less than eighteen thousand (18,000) feet in length. AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-

to the End User is equal to or less than 18,000 feet.
3.3.7 For any copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop being ordered by CLEC which has over six thousand (6,000) feet
of combined bridged tap will be modified, upon request from CLEC, so that the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
will have a maximum of six thousand (6,000) feet of bridged tap. This modification will be performed at no
additional charge to CLEC. In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE loop conditioning orders that require
the removal of bridged tap that serves no network design purpose on a copper 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
that will result in a combined total of bridged tap between two thousand five hundred (2,500) and six
thousand (6,000) feet will be performed at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. CLEC may request
removal of any unnecessary and non-Excessive bridged tap (bridged tap between zero (0) and two
thousand five hundred (2,500) feet which serves no network design purpose), at rates pursuant to AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s Special Construction (SC) Process, (which is a part of the service
inquiry process), as mutually agreed to by the Parties.
3.3.8 If CLEC requests Unbundled Loop Modification (ULM) on a reserved facility for a new 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop order, AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE may perform a pair change and provision a different
251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility in lieu of the reserved facility with ULM if feasible. The 251(c)(3)
Unbundled Loop provisioned will meet or exceed specifications of the requested 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
facility as modified. CLEC will not be charged for ULM if a different 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop is
provisioned. For 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loops that require a Design Layout Report (DLR) or its equivalent,
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9 STATE will provide LMU detail of the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop
provisioned.
3.3.9 CLEC shall request 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop make up information pursuant to this Attachment prior to
submitting a Service Inquiry, in accordance to the terms and conditions described in the AT&T CLEC Online
website, and/or a Local Service Request (LSR) for the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop type that CLEC desires
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE to condition.

3.3.10 When requesting ULM for a 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE has
previously provisioned for CLEC, CLEC will submit a Service Inquiry to AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-
STATE. If a spare 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility that meets the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop modification
specifications requested by CLEC is available at the location for which the ULM was requested, CLEC will
have the option to change the 251(c)(3) Unbundled Loop facility to the qualifying spare facility rather than to
provide ULM. In the event that AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE changes the 251(c)(3) Unbundled
Loop facility in lieu of providing ULM, CLEC will not be charged for ULM but will only be charged the service
order charges for submitting an order.
3.4 Loops and Subloops available under this Attachment are further identified in the Pricing Schedule and AT&T CLEC
Online website.

Page 3 of 3
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/13/12
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Coordinated Hot Cut (CHC) provided by AT&T-13STATE and for
Order Coordination (OC) and Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) provided by AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION
9-STATE.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Conversion of Service” means the matching of the disconnect of one Telecommunications product or service with
the installation of another Telecommunications product or service.
2.2 “Designated Installation” means an installation of service occurring at a specific time of day as specified.
3.0 CHC and OC (CHC/OC) Service Description
3.1 CHC/OC is an optional manual service offering that permits CLEC to request a Designated Installation and/or
Conversion of Service during or after normal business hours.
3.2 CHC/OC allows the Parties to coordinate the installation of the SL2 Loops (AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE),
Unbundled Digital Loops and other Loops where CHC/OC may be purchased as an option, to CLEC’s facilities in
order to limit the time an End User may be without service. CHC/OC is available when the Loop is provisioned over
an existing circuit that is currently providing service to the End User. CHC/OC for physical conversions will be
scheduled at AT&T-22STATE’s discretion during normal working hours on the committed due date.
3.3 CLEC will initiate the beginning of a CHC/OC by contacting the appropriate coordination center. This special request
enables CLEC to schedule and coordinate particular provisioning requirements with AT&T-22STATE.
3.4 AT&T-22STATE may limit the number of service orders that can be coordinated based on workload and resources
available. AT&T-22STATE shall approve the CHC/OC request on a non-discriminatory basis, by requesting carrier,
and on a first come first served basis.
3.5 AT&T-22STATE reserves the right to suspend the availability of CHC/OC service during unanticipated heavy
workload/activity periods. Heavy workload includes any unanticipated volume of work that impacts AT&T-
22STATE’s ability to provide its baseline service. Where time permits, AT&T-22STATE will make every effort to
notify CLEC when such unanticipated activities occur.
4.0 CHC/OC Pricing
4.1 CHC/OC is a time sensitive labor operation. Total charges are determined by a number of factors including the
volume of lines, day of the week, and the time of day requested for the coordinated cut.
4.2 When CLEC orders CHC/OC service, AT&T-22STATE shall charge and CLEC agrees to pay for CHC/OC service at
the “additional labor” or “Time and Material” rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule.
4.3 In the event AT&T-22STATE fails to meet a CHC/OC service commitment for reasons within the control of AT&T-
22STATE, AT&T-22STATE will not charge CLEC a CHC/OC service charge. However, in the event AT&T-
22STATE misses a CHC/OC service commitment due to reasons outside of AT&T-22STATE’s control, including but
not limited to actions of CLEC, its agent or End User, the CHC/OC service charge will still apply. For example, if
CLEC requests any change to an order with CHC/OC service including, but not limited to, no access to the CLEC’s
End User’s premises, or CLEC/End User not ready to proceed with the order, the CHC/OC service charge will apply
and AT&T-22STATE will not be obligated to ensure a CHC/OC for that order.
5.0 Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS) AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE Only
5.1 OC-TS is a chargeable option for all Loops except Unbundled Copper Loops (UCL) and is billed in addition to the OC
charge. CLEC may specify a time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (local time) Monday through Friday, excluding
AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE’s holidays. If CLEC specifies a time outside this window, or selects a time
or quantity of loops that requires AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE technicians to work outside normal work
hours, overtime charges will apply in addition to the OC and OC-TS charges. Overtime charges will be applied
based on the amount of overtime worked and in accordance with the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. The OC-
TS charges for an order due on the same day at the same location will be applied on a per LSR basis.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Resale Services provided by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC.
1.2 To the extent required by Section 251(c)(4) of the Act, AT&T-22STATE shall make available to CLEC for resale at
wholesale rates Telecommunications Services that AT&T-22STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not
Telecommunications Carriers.
1.3 Each state-specific avoided cost discount applicable to rates paid by CLEC for the resale of Telecommunications
Services is referred to herein as a Resale Discount. Where available, Resale Discounts are listed in the Pricing
Schedule; if not listed in the Pricing Schedule, the Resale Discount(s) and/or rate(s) as stated or reflected in the
applicable Tariff shall apply.
1.4 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific Tariff(s) shall govern the terms, conditions and
charges associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, with the exception of any
resale restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply.
Use limitations shall be in parity with services offered by AT&T-22STATE to its End Users.
1.5 Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is
effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 “Special Needs Services” means services for the physically disabled as defined in state-specific Tariffs.
2.2 “Tariff” means the most current state-specific retail and, where available, resale tariff(s) and/or Guidebook(s) (the
latter as posted on the AT&T CLEC Online website).
3.0 General Provisions
3.1 AT&T-22STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are concurrently offered to AT&T-22STATE’s End Users at
retail.
3.2 AT&T-22STATE has no obligation to make services available at the Resale Discount to CLEC for its own use or for
the use of one or more of its parent, Affiliates, subsidiaries or similarly-related entities. CLEC shall not use any
Resale Service to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-22STATE’s corresponding retail Tariff(s).
Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Service to provide access or interconnection services to itself,
interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), or other Telecommunications
providers; provided, however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local Exchange telephone service to
access IXCs, wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers.
3.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale at the Resale Discount pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of
the state-specific retail Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that End User’s existing location, both at the time of grandfathering.
3.4 CLEC shall only sell Plexar, Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is being
offered.
3.5 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-22STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of a
service by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
3.6 CLEC shall only resell services provided under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to whom AT&T-
22STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).

3.6.1 Where available for Resale in accordance with state-specific Tariffs, CLEC may resell Special Needs
Services and/or low income assistance services (e.g., LifeLine and Link-Up) to End Users who are eligible
for each such service. To the extent CLEC resells services that require certification on the part of the End
User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as
established by the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
3.6.2 CLEC as a reseller of Lifeline and Link-up Services hereby certifies that it has and will comply with the FCC
requirements governing the Lifeline and Link-Up programs as set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 54.417(a) and (b).
This includes the requirements set forth in AT&T’s GSST, Sections A3.31 and A4.4.7.
3.6.3 CLEC shall maintain documentation of FCC or applicable state eligibility to prove compliance with the
Lifeline and Link-Up programs for the three (3) full preceding calendar years, and CLEC shall provide such
documentation to the FCC or its Administrator upon request.
3.6.3.1 CLEC hereby permits AT&T to provide the FCC or its Administrator, USAC, or any Commission
information concerning CLEC’s participation in Lifeline and Link-Up programs.
3.6.4 AT&T-22STATE will provide the Lifeline Service to CLEC at the applicable Lifeline Local Exchange Tariff or
Guidebook rate, less an additional CLEC state discount as specified in the applicable Pricing Schedule.
AT&T-22STATE is the entity eligible to apply to and receive support from the applicable state Universal
Service Fund and the Federal Universal Service Fund for the Lifeline Service.
3.7 When ordering services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-22STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original end user service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End Users for such offering or promotion. AT&T-22STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each promotion
per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
3.8 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for Resale, whether
at the Resale Discount or otherwise; provided, however, that AT&T-22STATE shall offer Short-Term Promotions for
Resale at no Resale Discount in a particular state if and only to the extent required by Commission order in that
state.
3.9 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this
Attachment.
3.10 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local Exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
3.11 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-22STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have thirty (30)
calendar days to correct the violation and notify AT&T-22STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected.
AT&T-22STATE will bill CLEC a sum equal to:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-22STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for
the stated violation; and
(ii) the actual revenues CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation, whichever
is greater.
Should CLEC dispute the stated violation, CLEC must notify AT&T-22STATE in writing of the specific details and
reasons for its dispute within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Resale Notice from AT&T-22STATE and
comply with the Dispute Resolution provisions of the General Terms and Conditions (“GT&C”) of the Agreement
(“Dispute Resolution provisions”). Resolution of any dispute under this Attachment shall also be conducted in
compliance with the Dispute Resolution provisions in the GT&C.

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
3.12 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption (or
resale to similarly-situated end users) of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof (including, without limitation, the wholesale discount, if any,
associated with such resale). Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by both Parties and
approval by the Commission(s).
3.13 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-22STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-22STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-22STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
4.0 Responsibilities of Parties
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-22STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-22STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations, and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.
4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-22STATE is free to reclaim the End
User or process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-22STATE maintenance
center(s) twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, or otherwise shall be in parity with the ability offered
by AT&T-22STATE to its End Users. CLEC will be assigned Maintenance Center(s) when CLEC’s initial service
agreements are made. CLEC End Users calling AT&T-22STATE will be referred to CLEC at the telephone
number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to authorize CLEC to repair,
maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-22STATE’s network facilities, including without limitation those on End User
premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ activation of Call Trace and annoying call complaints shall be handled by the AT&T-22STATE
operations centers responsible for handling such requests. AT&T-22STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End
Users to provide call records to the proper authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case
involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through
CLEC. AT&T-22STATE shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against
any claim, loss or damage arising from providing this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the
corrective action necessary with its End User who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-
22STATE taking corrective action, up to and including disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-22STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-22STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the GT&Cs of the Agreement.
5.0 Billing and Payment of Rates and Charges
5.1 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Attachment, including
but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.

Attachment 16 - Resale/AT&T-22STATE

PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
5.1.1 Interexchange carried traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services
messages) received by AT&T-22STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as
unbillable and will not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those
messages to the carrier indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be
billed by AT&T-22STATE.
5.2 AT&T-22STATE shall not be responsible for the manner in which utilization of Resale Services or the associated
charges are allocated to End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC
under this Attachment will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for calling card, collect, or third number
billed calls (Alternately Billed Traffic or “ABT”) or toll and information services (for example, 900 calls), CLEC
must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this Attachment and pay any
applicable charges. It is the responsibility of CLEC to order the appropriate toll restriction or blocking on
lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for certain types of calls,
including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Express Call Completion. Depending on
the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may bypass
blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any charges
associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that bypass
blocking systems.

(PSPs) for PSPs’ use in providing payphone service. Rates for Payphone Services are established under the
provisions of Section 276 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and are not eligible for the Resale Discount
unless required by State Commission order(s). However, given certain billing system limitations, the Resale Discount
may be applied to Payphone Services, unless and until AT&T-22STATE is able to modify its billing system, and
AT&T-22STATE may issue true-up bills in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 12.19 of the General
Terms and Conditions.

unless required by Commission order(s).
7.3 AT&T-22STATE will offer Suspension of Service to CLEC for the purpose of CLEC initiated suspension of service of
the CLEC’s End Users. This service is not considered a Telecommunications Service and will receive no Resale

Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
1.0 Pricing Schedule
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the pricing terms and conditions. The rate tables included in this Attachment may be
divided into categories. These categories are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any
of the terms herein or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
1.2 Replacement of Non-Interim Rates
1.2.1 Certain of the current rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may have been established by
the Commission (“Commission-established “Current Rate(s)”). All rates included in this Agreement that are
not specifically excluded from treatment under this Section 1.2, or that are not marked as interim or as
“TBD” (To Be Determined) shall be considered Commission-established Current Rates. If, during the Term
of this Agreement the Commission or the FCC modifies a Commission-established Current Rate(s) in an
order or docket that is established by the Commission or FCC to be generally applicable (i.e., not an order
or docket relating only to a specific complaint or interconnection agreement arbitration) to the
Interconnection Services, either Party may provide written notice (“Rate Change Notice”) to the other Party,
after the effective date of such order, that it wishes for the modified Commission-established Non-Interim
Rate(s), (“Modified Rate(s)”) to replace and supersede the Commission-established Current Rate(s) already
set forth in this Agreement. Following such Rate Change Notice by either Party, and without the need for
any written amendment or further Commission action, CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC shall pay) the Modified Rate(s), pursuant to timeframes as specifically set forth in Section 1.2.1.1
below and Section 1.2.1.3 below, and the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as
provided in Section 1.2.1.1 below and Section 1.2.1.3 below. Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a
conforming amendment which shall reflect that the Commission-established Current Rate(s) were replaced
by the Modified Rate(s), and shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval. In addition, as
soon as is reasonably practicable after such Rate Change Notice, each Party shall issue to the other Party
any adjustments that are necessary to reflect that the Modified Rate(s) became effective between the
Parties as provided:
1.2.1.1 If the Rate Change Notice is issued by a Party within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective
date of any such order, the Modified Rate(s) will be deemed effective between the Parties as of the
effective date of the order, and AT&T-22STATE will issue any adjustments that are appropriate
(e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments) to retroactively true-up the Modified
Rate(s) with the Commission-established current Rate(s) for the period after the effective date of
the order, in accordance herewith.
1.2.1.2 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Change Notice to the other Party with respect to an
order, the Commission-established Non-Interim Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to
apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.2.1.3 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Change Notice under this Section 1.2 above, but not within
ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Modified Rate(s) will be
deemed effective between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Modified
Rate(s) into the Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is
approved or is deemed to have been approved by the state commission), and shall apply, on a
prospective basis only, upon the amendment effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further,
the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the Commission-established
Current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) if the terms and conditions of this Section 1.2 above were
not part of an approved and effective agreement between the Parties at the time the order became
effective, either Party may still give a Rate Change Notice, and the Modified Rate(s) shall be
effective as of the date the Parties’ Agreement (containing this Section 1.2,) becomes effective
(following the date the Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the
Commission) and shall apply, beginning on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis
only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Commission-established current Rate(s) with the Modified Rate(s) for any period prior to the
effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.2 above.

1.3 Replacement of Interim Rates
1.3.1 Certain of the rates, prices and charges set forth in this Agreement may be denoted as interim rates
(“Current Interim Rates”). Upon the effective date of a Commission Order establishing non-interim rates for
any rates, prices, charges, Interconnection Services specifically identified herein as interim, either Party
may, within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such Commission order, provide written
notice (“Replacement Rate Notice”) to the other Party that it wishes to obtain the new Commission-
established rate(s) (“Replacement Rates”) to replace and supersede the Interim Rate counterpart(s) in this
Agreement. Following such Replacement Rate Notice, and without the need for any formal amendment or
further Commission action, AT&T-22STATE will update CLEC’s billing tables to replace the Current Interim
Rates with their Replacement Rate(s) counterpart(s), as specified in the Replacement Rate Notice.
Nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment to reflect such Replacement Rates and
shall submit such amendment to the Commission for approval.
1.3.2 If the Replacement Rate Notice is given within ninety (90) calendar days after the effective date of such
order, then the Replacement Rate(s) shall apply as of the effective date of the order and AT&T-22STATE
will issue any adjustments that are appropriate (e.g., billing of additional charges, billing credit adjustments)
to retroactively true-up the Replacement Rates with the Interim Rates for the period after the effective date
of this Agreement, in accordance herewith.
1.3.3 In the event that neither Party issues a Rate Notice to the other Party with respect to an order, the Interim
Rate(s) set forth in the Agreement shall continue to apply, notwithstanding the issuance of that order.
1.3.4 In the event that a Party issues a Rate Notice under this Section 1.3 above, but not within ninety (90)
calendar days after the effective date of the order, then the Replacement Rate(s) will be deemed effective
between the Parties as of the date the amendment incorporating such Replacement Rate(s) into the
Agreement is effective between the Parties (following the date the amendment is approved or is deemed to
have been approved by the Commission), and shall apply, upon the amendment effective date, on a
prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from replacing or otherwise superseding the
Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period prior to the effective date of such
amendment.
1.3.5 In the event the terms and conditions of this Section 1.3 above were not part of an approved and effective
agreement between the Parties at the time the order became effective, either Party may still give a
Replacement Rate Notice, and the Replacement Rate(s) shall be effective as of the date the Parties’
Agreement (the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above) becomes effective (following the date the
Agreement is approved or deemed to have been approved by the Commission) and shall apply, beginning
on the Agreement’s effective date, on a prospective basis only. Further, the Party shall be foreclosed from
replacing or otherwise superseding the Current Interim Rate(s) with the Replacement Rate(s) for any period
prior to the effective date of the Agreement containing this Section 1.3 above.
1.4 Notice to Adopting CLECs
1.4.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Pricing Schedule and Agreement, in the event that any other
CLEC should seek to adopt the Agreement pursuant to Section 252(i) of the Act (“Adopting CLEC”), the
Adopting CLEC would only be entitled to the current and/or interim rates set forth in this Agreement as of
the date that the MFN’d Agreement provisions become effective between AT&T-22STATE and the Adopting
CLEC (i.e., following the date the Commission approves or is deemed to have approved the Adopting
CLEC’s Section 252(i) adoption (“MFN Effective Date”)) and on a prospective basis only. Nothing in this
Agreement shall entitle an Adopting CLEC to any retroactive application of any rates under this Agreement
to any date prior to the MFN Effective Date and any adopting CLEC is foreclosed from making any such
claim hereunder.
1.4.2 AT&T-22STATE obligation, under this Agreement, per the GT&C is to only provide Interconnection Services
for which complete rates, terms and conditions are contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent
CLEC orders a product or service for which there are not complete rates, terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE may reject the order. CLEC must amend this Agreement to allow ordering

Pricing Schedule/AT&T-22STATE
Page 4 of 5
PEERLESS NETWORK OF MICHIGAN, LLC
Version: 3Q12 - CLEC ICA - 09/27/12
of products and services for which complete rates, terms and conditions did not exist as of the Effective
Date of the Agreement to the extent such product or service is still available at the time of the request. In
the event that CLEC orders, and AT&T-22STATE provisions, a product or service to CLEC for which there
are not complete rates, terms and conditions in this Agreement, then CLEC understands and agrees that
one of the following will occur:
1.4.3 CLEC shall pay for the product or service provisioned to CLEC at the rates set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s
applicable intrastate tariff(s) for the product or service or, to the extent there are no tariff rates, terms or
conditions available for the product or service in the applicable state, then CLEC shall pay for the product or
service at AT&T-22STATE’s current generic contract rate for the product or service set forth in AT&T-
22STATE’s applicable state-specific generic Pricing Sheet as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website;
or
1.4.4 CLEC will be billed and shall pay for the product or service as provided in Section 1.4.3 above, and AT&T-
22STATE may, without further obligation, reject future orders and further provisioning of the product or
service until such time as applicable rates, terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement as set
forth in this Section 1.4.2 above. If CLEC and AT&T-22STATE cannot agree on rates, terms, and
conditions either Party may institute the Dispute Resolution provisions as contained in the GT&Cs.
1.4.5 AT&T-22STATE’s provisioning of orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.4.2 above, and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-22STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such products and/or services.
1.4.6 Where the rate for an AT&T-22STATE Interconnection Service is identified as a tariffed rate, any changes
to the tariff rate shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement. The issuance of a Commission
Order approving such rate change shall be the only Notice required under this Agreement. Provided
however, should a tariff or tariff rate, incorporated into this Agreement, be withdrawn or invalidated in any
way during the term of this Agreement, the last rate in effect at the time of such withdrawal or invalidation
shall continue to apply during the remaining term of this Agreement.
1.4.7 The Resale Discount applicable to purchases of Resold Services in each State is the current Commission-
approved rate. Any Commission approved or ordered change in the Resale discount for Resold Services
shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement for the state in which such Commission approves or
orders the change. The issuance of the Commission Order approving such change shall be the only Notice
required under this Agreement.
1.5 Establishment of “TBD” Rates
1.5.1 When a rate, price or charge in this Agreement is noted as “To Be Determined” or “TBD” or no rate is
shown, the Parties understand and agree that when a rate, price or charge is established by AT&T-
22STATE for that Interconnection Service and incorporated into AT&T-22STATE’s current state-specific
Generic Pricing Sheet as published on the AT&T CLEC Online website, that rate(s) (“Established Rate”)
shall automatically apply to the Interconnection Service provided under this Agreement back to the Effective
Date of this Agreement as to any orders CLEC submitted and AT&T-22STATE provisioned for that
Interconnection Service without the need for any additional modification(s) to this Agreement or further
Commission action. AT&T-22STATE shall provide Written Notice to CLEC of the application of the rate,
price or charge that has been established, and the CLEC’s billing tables will be updated to reflect (and
CLEC will be charged) the Established Rate, and the Established Rate will be deemed effective between the
Parties as of the Effective Date of the Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate a conforming amendment,
which shall reflect the Established Rate that applies to such Product or Service pursuant to this Section 1.5
above, and shall submit such Amendment to the State Commission for approval. In addition, as soon as is
reasonably practicable after such Established Rate begins to apply, AT&T-22STATE shall bill CLEC to
reflect the application of the Established Rate retroactively to the Effective Date of the Agreement between
the Parties.

1.5.2 AT&T-22STATE’s provisioning of such orders for such Interconnection Services is expressly subject to this
Section 1.5 above and in no way constitutes a waiver of AT&T-22STATE’s right to charge and collect
payment for such Interconnection Services.
1.6 Recurring Charges
1.6.1 Unless otherwise identified in the Pricing Sheet, where rates are shown as monthly, a month will be defined
as a thirty (30) day calendar month. The minimum term for each monthly rated Interconnection Services will
be one (1) month. After the initial month, billing will be on the basis of whole or fractional months used. The
minimum term for Interconnection Services, if applicable, will be specified in the rate tables included in this
Attachment.
1.6.2 Where rates are distance sensitive, the mileage will be calculated on the airline distance involved between
the locations. To determine the rate to be billed AT&T-22STATE will first compute the mileage using the
V&H coordinates method, as set forth in the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc. Tariff FCC No 4.
When the calculation results in a fraction of a mile, AT&T-22STATE will round up to the next whole mile
before determining the mileage and applying rates.
1.7 Non-Recurring Charges:
1.7.1 Where rates consist of usage sensitive charges or per occurrence charges, such rates are classified as
“non-recurring charges”.
1.7.2 Consistent with FCC Rule 51.307(d), there may be non-recurring charges for each 251(c)(3) UNE.
1.7.3 When CLEC converts an End-User currently receiving non-complex service from AT&T-22STATE, without
any facilities rearrangements to AT&T-22STATE’s network, the normal service order charges and/or
nonrecurring charges associated with said additions and/or changes will apply.
1.7.4 CLEC shall pay the applicable service order processing/administration charge for each service order
submitted by CLEC to AT&T-22STATE to process a request for installation, disconnection, rearrangement,
change, or record order.
1.7.5 In some cases, Commissions have ordered AT&T-22STATE to separate disconnect costs and installation
costs into two separate nonrecurring charges. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted in this Agreement, the
Commission-ordered disconnect charges will be applied at the time the disconnect activity is performed by
AT&T-22STATE, regardless of whether or not a disconnect order is issued by CLEC.
1.7.6 Time and Material charges, also known as Additional Labor Charges, are defined in the Price Sheet
contained herein.
1.7.7 Loop Zone charges are defined in the Price Sheet contained herein.
1.8 AT&T CALIFORNIA only:
1.8.1 The Pricing Sheet contained in this Agreement contains both zone and statewide rates for many of the Rate
Element Descriptions contained within the Unbundled Exchange Access Loop Product. CLEC must select
either zone rates or statewide rates for these rate elements upon the establishment of the BAN(s) for CLEC
in California.
1.8.1.1 CLEC will indicate on the WEST - UNE/UNE-P/LWC™/Commercial Agreements BAN REQUEST
FORM which type of rates that the CLEC wants to be billed: Zone or Statewide. The form is
provided to CLEC in the West Implementation Checklist for Facility-Based/LWC/Resale
package.
1.8.1.2 Once CLEC selects either the zone or statewide rate, that rate type will remain for the life of the
contract.
