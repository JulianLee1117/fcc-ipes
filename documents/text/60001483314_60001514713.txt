Before the
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20554
In the Matter of )
)
Vonage Holdings Corp., Applicant ) WC Docket No. 15-
)
For Authorization to Obtain Numbering )
Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of )
the Commission’s Rules )
APPLICATION OF VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP. FOR AUTHORIZATION TO
OBTAIN NUMBERING RESOURCES
Vonage Holdings Corp. (“Vonage”), pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the
Commission’s Rules, respectfully requests authorization to obtain numbering resources as
described below.
As set forth in the Commission’s Numbering Order,1 an interconnected VoIP provider
may obtain numbering resources from the Numbering Administrator upon a showing that it is
authorized to provide service in the area for which the numbering resources are requested. Such
authorization may be obtained upon an application to the Commission containing the information
detailed in Sections 52.15(g)(3)(i)(A)-(F) of the Commission’s Rules. Vonage hereby requests
the Commission grant it that authorization. In support of this application, Vonage provides the
following information:
1 Numbering Policies for Modern Communications, FCC 15-70 (rel. June 22, 2015).

I. INFORMATION REQUIRED BY SECTION 52.15(g)(3)(i)
(A) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(A)
Name: Vonage Holdings Corp.
Address: 23 Main St., Holmdel, NJ 07733
Telephone: 732-444-2216
Qualified Personnel: Brendan Kasper, Senior Regulatory Counsel
(B) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(B)
Vonage hereby acknowledges that authorization to obtain numbering resources under
Section 52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules is subject to compliance with applicable
Commission numbering rules as well as to the numbering authority delegated to the states.
Vonage hereby also acknowledges that this authorization is subject to compliance with industry
guidelines and practices regarding numbering, just as to telecommunications carriers.
(C) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(C)
Vonage hereby acknowledges that it must file requests for numbers with the relevant
state commission(s) at least 30 days before requesting numbers from the Numbering
Administrators.
(D) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D)
Vonage hereby sets forth its capability to provide service within 60 days of the
numbering resources activation date.
Vonage currently holds approximately 115,000 numbers directly, obtained during the
limited trial of direct access to numbers. Vonage consequently has an OCN; appears in the
LERG and NPAC in the IPES category; has an agreement in place with its CLEC partner for
2

routing to ILECs; and has, in some cases, negotiated direct IP interconnection with ILECs. In
addition, Vonage has developed porting tools to enable carriers to submit porting requests and
has accomplished bulk ports with no difficulty. As a result, Vonage already has in place the
necessary procedures to enable it to place numbers into service within 60 days of activation.
During the trial, Vonage was able to place numbers into service within, on average, 15-20 days
of the activation date of those numbers, well within the 60 day time frame required by the
Commission’s rules. Under its current agreements and established procedures, Vonage will be
able to place nearly all numbers into service within similar timeframe, and all numbers will be
placed into service within 60 days of activation.
As proof of its facilities readiness, Vonage has attached to this application (1) an
agreement between Vonage and its carrier partner providing that the carrier partner will host
Vonage numbers on its switches and provide PSTN connectivity for inbound calls to Vonage
numbers and (2) an interconnection agreement between Vonage’s carrier partner and a local
exchange carrier. These documents are attached as Exhibits A and B.
(E) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(E)
Vonage hereby certifies that it complies with its Universal Service Fund contribution
obligations under 47 CFR part 54, subpart H, its Telecommunications Relay Service contribution
obligations under 47 CFR § 64.604(c)(5)(iii), its North American Numbering Plan and Local
Number Portability Administration contribution obligations under 47 CFR §§ 52.17, 52.32, its
obligations to pay regulatory fees under 47 CFR § 1.1154, and its 911 obligations under 47 CFR
part 9.
3

(F) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(F)
Vonage hereby certifies that it has the financial, managerial, and technical expertise to
provide reliable service. As shown in the limited trial of direct access to numbers, Vonage was
not only able to place numbers into service, but it did so without any impairment. During the
trial, Vonage calls routed successfully, as normal; Vonage ported numbers in and out
successfully, as normal; and direct access did not impact terminating intercarrier compensation
for calls originated from these numbers.
Vonage’s long experience with number porting enabled it, along with its carrier partners,
to create routing arrangements to seamlessly deliver calls to numbers directly assigned to
Vonage. Moreover, Vonage used the trial as an opportunity to deploy the same porting tools
used by traditional carriers, to the benefit of Vonage’s customers and other providers. At the
start of the trial, Vonage established a web interface for processing local service requests for
porting numbers, allowing providers to request credentials and submit porting requests – the
same approach adopted by many traditional carriers.
Vonage’s key management and technical personnel are listed below. None of the
identified personnel are being or have been investigated by the Commission or any law
enforcement or regulatory agency for failure to comply with any law, rule, or order.
Key Personnel: Graham McGonigal, Chief Network Operations Officer
Ed Mulligan, Vice President Carrier Operations
Michael Doherty, Senior Director Carrier Operations
Darren Krebs, Senior Director Carrier Operations
(G) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(G)
Vonage hereby certifies that no party to this application is subject to a denial of Federal
benefits pursuant to Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U.S.C. § 862.
4

II. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CONDITIONS IN SECTION 52.15(g)(3)(iv)
As required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(iv), Vonage will maintain the accuracy of all contact
information and certifications in this application, and will file a correction with the Commission
and each applicable state within 30 days of any changes. Vonage will also furnish accurate
regulatory and numbering contact information to each state commission when requesting
numbers in that state.
III. CONCLUSION
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commissions’ Rules, Vonage respectfully
requests the Commission grant this application for authorization to obtain numbering resources.

AGREEMENT
PREFACE
This Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective as of October 11, 2007 (the “Effective
Date”), between Peerless Network of Pennsylvania, LLC (“PN”), a Limited Liability Company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, with offices at 27 N. Wacker St., Suite 444,
Chicago, IL 60606 and Verizon Pennsylvania Inc. (“Verizon”), a corporation organized under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with offices at 1717 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA
19103 (Verizon and PN may be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a “Party”, and,
collectively, as the “Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and PN hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and PN.

1.4 Except as otherwise provided in the Principal Document, the Principal Document
may not be waived or modified except by a written document that is signed by
the Parties. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, a Party shall have
the right to add, modify, or withdraw, its Tariff(s) at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the other Party.
2. Term and Termination
2.1 This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and, unless cancelled
or terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, shall continue in effect
until October 10, 2009 (the “Initial Term”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall
continue in force and effect unless and until cancelled or terminated as provided
in this Agreement.

of the Initial Term or effective upon any date after expiration of the Initial Term by
providing written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days in advance of the
date of termination.
2.3 If either PN or Verizon provides notice of termination pursuant to Section 2.2 and
on or before the proposed date of termination either PN or Verizon has requested

4. Applicable Law
4.1 The construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be
governed by (a) the laws of the United States of America and (b) the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. All

disputes relating to this Agreement shall be resolved through the application of
such laws.
4.2 Each Party shall remain in compliance with Applicable Law in the course of
performing this Agreement.
4.3 Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance by it that
results from requirements of Applicable Law, or acts or failures to act of any
governmental entity or official.
4.4 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any governmental
action that limits, suspends, cancels, withdraws, or otherwise materially affects,
the notifying Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
4.5 If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under
Applicable Law, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall
be construed as if it did not contain such invalid or unenforceable provision;
provided, that if the invalid or unenforceable provision is a material provision of
this Agreement, or the invalidity or unenforceability materially affects the rights or
obligations of a Party hereunder or the ability of a Party to perform any material
provision of this Agreement, the Parties shall promptly renegotiate in good faith
and amend in writing this Agreement in order to make such mutually acceptable
revisions to this Agreement as may be required in order to conform the
Agreement to Applicable Law.
4.6 If any legislative, regulatory, judicial or other governmental decision, order,
determination or action, or any change in Applicable Law, materially affects any
material provision of this Agreement, the rights or obligations of a Party
hereunder, or the ability of a Party to perform any material provision of this
Agreement, the Parties shall promptly renegotiate in good faith and amend in
writing this Agreement in order to make such mutually acceptable revisions to
this Agreement as may be required in order to conform the Agreement to
Applicable Law. If within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such decision,
determination, action or change, the Parties are unable to agree in writing upon
mutually acceptable revisions to this Agreement, either Party may pursue any
remedies available to it under this Agreement, at law, in equity, or otherwise,
including, but not limited to, instituting an appropriate proceeding before the
Commission, the FCC, or a court of competent jurisdiction, without first pursuing
dispute resolution in accordance with Section 14 of this Agreement.
4.6.1 Notwithstanding Section 4.6 above, to the extent Verizon is required by
a change in Applicable Law to provide to PN a Service that is not
offered under this Agreement to PN, the terms, conditions and prices
for such Service (including, but not limited to, the terms and conditions
defining the Service and stating when and where the Service will be
available and how it will be used, and terms, conditions and prices for
pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, repair, maintenance and billing)
shall be as provided in an applicable Verizon Tariff, or, in the absence
of an applicable Verizon Tariff, as mutually agreed by the Parties in a
written amendment to the Agreement that, upon the request of either
Party, the Parties shall negotiate in accordance with the requirements
of Section 252 of the Act. In no event shall Verizon be required to
provide any such Service in the absence of such a Verizon Tariff or
amendment.

4.7 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, as a result of any
legislative, judicial, regulatory or other governmental decision, order,
determination or action, or any change in Applicable Law, Verizon is not required
by Applicable Law to provide any Service, payment or benefit, otherwise required
to be provided to PN hereunder, then Verizon may discontinue the provision of
any such Service, payment or benefit, and PN shall reimburse Verizon for any
payment previously made by Verizon to PN that was not required by Applicable
Law. Verizon will provide thirty (30) days prior written notice to PN of any such
discontinuance of a Service, unless a different notice period or different
conditions are specified in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, in the
Networks Element Attachment or an applicable Tariff) or Applicable Law for
termination of such Service in which event such specified period and/or
conditions shall apply. For the avoidance of any doubt, this Section 4.7 is self-
effectuating and no amendment to this Agreement shall be required to implement
it.
5. Assignment
Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any right or interest under this Agreement,
nor delegate any obligation under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 5 shall be void and
ineffective and constitute default of this Agreement.
6. Assurance of Payment
6.1 Upon request by Verizon, PN shall, at any time and from time to time, provide to
Verizon adequate assurance of payment of amounts due (or to become due) to
Verizon hereunder.
6.2 Assurance of payment of charges may be requested by Verizon if PN (a) prior to
the Effective Date, has failed to timely pay a bill rendered to PN by Verizon or its
Affiliates, (b) on or after the Effective Date, fails to timely pay a bill rendered to
PN by Verizon or its Affiliates, (c) in Verizon’s reasonable judgment, at the
Effective Date or at any time thereafter, is unable to demonstrate that it is
creditworthy, or (d) admits its inability to pay its debts as such debts become due,
has commenced a voluntary case (or has had a case commenced against it)
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, winding-up, composition or adjustment of debts or the
like, has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to a
receivership or similar proceeding.
6.3 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the assurance of payment shall consist
of an unconditional, irrevocable standby letter of credit naming Verizon as the
beneficiary thereof and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to Verizon
from a financial institution acceptable to Verizon. The letter of credit shall be in
an amount equal to two (2) months anticipated charges (including, but not limited
to, both recurring and non-recurring charges), as reasonably determined by
Verizon, for the Services to be provided by Verizon to PN in connection with this
Agreement. If PN meets the condition in subsection 6.2(d) above or has failed to
timely pay two or more bills rendered by Verizon or a Verizon Affiliate in any
twelve (12)-month period, Verizon may, at its option, demand (and PN shall
provide) additional assurance of payment, consisting of monthly advanced
payments of estimated charges as reasonably determined by Verizon, with
appropriate true-up against actual billed charges no more frequently than once
per Calendar Quarter.

6.4 [Intentionally Left Blank].
6.5 [Intentionally Left Blank].
6.6 Verizon may (but is not obligated to) draw on the letter of credit upon notice to
PN in respect of any amounts to be paid by PN hereunder that are not paid within
thirty (30) days of the date that payment of such amounts is required by this
Agreement.
6.7 If Verizon draws on the letter of credit, upon request by Verizon, PN shall provide
a replacement or supplemental letter of credit conforming to the requirements of
Section6.3.
6.8 Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, if Verizon makes a
request for assurance of payment in accordance with the terms of this Section,
then Verizon shall have no obligation thereafter to perform under this Agreement
until such time as PN has provided Verizon with such assurance of payment.
6.9 The fact that a letter of credit is requested by Verizon hereunder shall in no way
relieve PN from compliance with the requirements of this Agreement (including,
but not limited to, any applicable Tariffs) as to advance payments and payment
for Services, nor constitute a waiver or modification of the terms herein pertaining
to the discontinuance of Services for nonpayment of any amounts payment of
which is required by this Agreement.
7. Audits
7.1 Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, either Party
(“Auditing Party”) may audit the other Party’s (“Audited Party”) books, records,
documents, facilities and systems for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of
the Audited Party’s bills. Such audits may be performed once in each Calendar
Year; provided, however, that audits may be conducted more frequently (but no
more frequently than once in each Calendar Quarter) if the immediately
preceding audit found previously uncorrected net inaccuracies in billing in favor
of the Audited Party having an aggregate value of at least $1,000,000.
7.2 The audit shall be performed by independent certified public accountants
selected and paid by the Auditing Party. The accountants shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Audited Party. Prior to commencing the audit, the accountants
shall execute an agreement with the Audited Party in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Audited Party that protects the confidentiality of the information
disclosed by the Audited Party to the accountants. The audit shall take place at
a time and place agreed upon by the Parties; provided, that the Auditing Party
may require that the audit commence no later than sixty (60) days after the
Auditing Party has given notice of the audit to the Audited Party.
7.3 Each Party shall cooperate fully in any such audit, providing reasonable access
to any and all employees, books, records, documents, facilities and systems,
reasonably necessary to assess the accuracy of the Audited Party’s bills.
7.4 Audits shall be performed at the Auditing Party’s expense, provided that there
shall be no charge for reasonable access to the Audited Party’s employees,
books, records, documents, facilities and systems necessary to assess the
accuracy of the Audited Party’s bills.
8. Authorization

8.1 Verizon represents and warrants that it is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
8.2 PN represents and warrants that it is a Limited Liability Company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.
8.3 PN Certification.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Verizon shall have no
obligation to perform under this Agreement until such time as PN has obtained
such FCC and Commission authorization as may be required by Applicable Law
for conducting business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PN shall not
place any Orders under this Agreement until it has obtained such authorization.
PN shall provide proof of such authorization to Verizon upon request.
9. Billing and Payment; Disputed Amounts
9.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall submit to the
other Party on a monthly basis in an itemized form, statement(s) of charges
incurred by the other Party under this Agreement.
9.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, payment of amounts billed for
Services provided under this Agreement, whether billed on a monthly basis or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be due, in immediately available U.S.
funds, on the later of the following dates (the “Due Date”): (a) the due date
specified on the billing Party’s statement; or (b) twenty (20) days after the date
the statement is received by the billed Party. Payments shall be transmitted by
electronic funds transfer.
9.3 If any portion of an amount billed by a Party under this Agreement is subject to a
good faith dispute between the Parties, the billed Party shall give notice to the
billing Party of the amounts it disputes (“Disputed Amounts”) and include in such
notice the specific details and reasons for disputing each item. A Party may also
dispute prospectively with a single notice a class of charges that it disputes.
Notice of a dispute may be given by a Party at any time, either before or after an
amount is paid, and a Party’s payment of an amount shall not constitute a waiver
of such Party’s right to subsequently dispute its obligation to pay such amount or
to seek a refund of any amount paid. The billed Party shall pay by the Due Date
all undisputed amounts. Billing disputes shall be subject to the terms of Section
14, Dispute Resolution.
9.4 Charges due to the billing Party that are not paid by the Due Date, shall be
subject to a late payment charge. The late payment charge shall be in an
amount specified by the billing Party which shall not exceed a rate of one-and-
one-half percent (1.5%) of the overdue amount (including any unpaid previously
billed late payment charges) per month.
9.5 Although it is the intent of both Parties to submit timely statements of charges,
failure by either Party to present statements to the other Party in a timely manner
shall not constitute a breach or default, or a waiver of the right to payment of the
incurred charges, by the billing Party under this Agreement, and, except for
assertion of a provision of Applicable Law that limits the period in which a suit or
other proceeding can be brought before a court or other governmental entity of

appropriate jurisdiction to collect amounts due, the billed Party shall not be
entitled to dispute the billing Party’s statement(s) based on the billing Party’s
failure to submit them in a timely fashion.
10. Confidentiality
10.1 As used in this Section 10, “Confidential Information” means the following
information that is disclosed by one Party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other Party

10.1.1 Books, records, documents and other information disclosed in an audit
pursuant to Section 7;
10.1.2 Any forecasting information provided pursuant to this Agreement;
10.1.3 Customer Information (except to the extent that (a) the Customer
information is published in a directory, (b) the Customer information is
disclosed through or in the course of furnishing a Telecommunications
Service, such as directory assistance, operator service, Caller ID or
similar service, or LIDB service, or (c) the Customer to whom the
Customer Information is related has authorized the Receiving Party to
use and/or disclose the Customer Information);
10.1.4 information related to specific facilities or equipment (including, but not
limited to, cable and pair information);
10.1.5 any information that is in written, graphic, electromagnetic, or other
tangible form, and marked at the time of disclosure as “Confidential” or

10.1.6 any information that is communicated orally or visually and declared to
the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure, and by written notice with
a statement of the information given to the Receiving Party within ten
(10) days after disclosure, to be “Confidential or “Proprietary”.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Party shall have the
right to refuse to accept receipt of information which the other Party has identified
as Confidential Information pursuant to Sections 10.1.5 or 10.1.6.
10.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall:
10.2.1 use the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party
only in performance of this Agreement; and
10.2.2 using the same degree of care that it uses with similar confidential
information of its own (but in no case a degree of care that is less than
commercially reasonable), hold Confidential Information received from
the Disclosing Party in confidence and restrict disclosure of the
Confidential Information solely to those of the Receiving Party’s
Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees, Agents and
contractors of the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Affiliates,
that have a need to receive such Confidential Information in order to
perform the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The
Receiving Party’s Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees,
Agents and contractors of the Receiving Party and the Receiving
Party’s Affiliates, shall be required by the Receiving Party to comply
with the provisions of this Section 10 in the same manner as the

Receiving Party. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any failure of
the Receiving Party’s Affiliates or the directors, officers, employees,
Agents or contractors of the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s
Affiliates, to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.
10.3 The Receiving Party shall return or destroy all Confidential Information received
from the Disclosing Party, including any copies made by the Receiving Party,
within thirty (30) days after a written request by the Disclosing Party is delivered
to the Receiving Party, except for (a) Confidential Information that the Receiving
Party reasonably requires to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and
(b) one copy for archival purposes only.
10.4 Unless otherwise agreed, the obligations of Sections 10.2 and 10.3 do not apply
to information that:
10.4.1 was, at the time of receipt, already in the possession of or known to the
Receiving Party free of any obligation of confidentiality and restriction
on use;
10.4.2 is or becomes publicly available or known through no wrongful act of
the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party’s Affiliates, or the directors,
officers, employees, Agents or contractors of the Receiving Party or
the Receiving Party’s Affiliates;
10.4.3 is rightfully received from a third person having no direct or indirect
obligation of confidentiality or restriction on use to the Disclosing Party
with respect to such information;
10.4.4 is independently developed by the Receiving Party;
10.4.5 is approved for disclosure or use by written authorization of the
Disclosing Party (including, but not limited to, in this Agreement); or
10.4.6 is required to be disclosed by the Receiving Party pursuant to
Applicable Law, provided that the Receiving Party shall have made
commercially reasonable efforts to give adequate notice of the
requirement to the Disclosing Party in order to enable the Disclosing
Party to seek protective arrangements.
10.5 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.1 through 10.4, the Receiving
Party may use and disclose Confidential Information received from the Disclosing
Party to the extent necessary to enforce the Receiving Party’s rights under this
Agreement or Applicable Law. In making any such disclosure, the Receiving
Party shall make reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality and restrict the
use of the Confidential Information while it is in the possession of any person to
whom it is disclosed, including, but not limited to, by requesting any
governmental entity to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed to treat it
as confidential and restrict its use to purposes related to the proceeding pending
before it.
10.6 The Disclosing Party shall retain all of the Disclosing Party’s right, title and
interest in any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the
Receiving Party. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no
license is granted by this Agreement with respect to any Confidential Information
(including, but not limited to, under any patent, trademark or copyright), nor is
any such license to be implied solely by virtue of the disclosure of Confidential
Information.

10.7 The provisions of this Section 10 shall be in addition to and not in derogation of
any provisions of Applicable Law, including, but not limited to, 47 U.S.C. § 222,
and are not intended to constitute a waiver by a Party of any right with regard to
the use, or protection of the confidentiality of, CPNI provided by Applicable Law.
10.8 Each Party’s obligations under this Section 10 shall survive expiration,
cancellation or termination of this Agreement.
11. Counterparts
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.
12. Default
If either Party (“Defaulting Party”) fails to make a payment required by this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, any payment required by Section 9.3 of undisputed amounts
to the billing Party) or materially breaches any other material provision of this Agreement,
and such failure or breach continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
the other Party, the other Party may, by written notice to the Defaulting Party, (a)
suspend the provision of any or all Services hereunder, or (b) cancel this Agreement and
terminate the provision of all Services hereunder.
13. Discontinuance of Service by PN
13.1 If PN proposes to discontinue, or actually discontinues, its provision of service to
all or substantially all of its Customers, whether voluntarily, as a result of
bankruptcy, or for any other reason, PN shall send written notice of such
discontinuance to Verizon, the Commission, and each of PN’s Customers. PN
shall provide such notice such number of days in advance of discontinuance of
its service as shall be required by Applicable Law. Unless the period for advance
notice of discontinuance of service required by Applicable Law is more than thirty
(30) days, to the extent commercially feasible, PN shall send such notice at least
thirty (30) days prior to its discontinuance of service.
13.2 Such notice must advise each PN Customer that unless action is taken by the
PN Customer to switch to a different carrier prior to PN’s proposed
discontinuance of service, the PN Customer will be without the service provided
by PN to the PN Customer.
13.3 Should a PN Customer subsequently become a Verizon Customer, PN shall
provide Verizon with all information necessary for Verizon to establish service for
the PN Customer, including, but not limited to, the PN Customer’s billed name,
listed name, service address, and billing address, and the services being
provided to the PN Customer.
13.4 Nothing in this Section 13 shall limit Verizon’s right to cancel or terminate this
Agreement or suspend provision of Services under this Agreement.
14. Dispute Resolution
14.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any dispute between the Parties
regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any of its terms
shall be addressed by good faith negotiation between the Parties. To initiate
such negotiation, a Party must provide to the other Party written notice of the
dispute that includes both a detailed description of the dispute or alleged

nonperformance and the name of an individual who will serve as the initiating
Party’s representative in the negotiation. The other Party shall have ten
Business Days to designate its own representative in the negotiation. The
Parties’ representatives shall meet at least once within 45 days after the date of
the initiating Party’s written notice in an attempt to reach a good faith resolution
of the dispute. Upon agreement, the Parties’ representatives may utilize other
alternative dispute resolution procedures such as private mediation to assist in
the negotiations.
14.2 If the Parties have been unable to resolve the dispute within 45 days of the date
of the initiating Party’s written notice, either Party may pursue any remedies
available to it under this Agreement, at law, in equity, or otherwise, including, but
not limited to, instituting an appropriate proceeding before the Commission, the
FCC, or a court of competent jurisdiction.
15. Force Majeure
15.1 Neither Party shall be responsible for any delay or failure in performance which
results from causes beyond its reasonable control (“Force Majeure Events”),
whether or not foreseeable by such Party. Such Force Majeure Events include,
but are not limited to, adverse weather conditions, flood, fire, explosion,
earthquake, volcanic action, power failure, embargo, boycott, war, revolution, civil
commotion, act of public enemies, labor unrest (including, but not limited to,
strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, picketing or boycotts), inability to obtain
equipment, parts, software or repairs thereof, acts or omissions of the other
Party, and acts of God.
15.2 If a Force Majeure Event occurs, the non-performing Party shall give prompt
notification of its inability to perform to the other Party. During the period that the
non-performing Party is unable to perform, the other Party shall also be excused
from performance of its obligations to the extent such obligations are reciprocal
to, or depend upon, the performance of the non-performing Party that has been
prevented by the Force Majeure Event. The non-performing Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the cause(s) of its non-
performance and both Parties shall proceed to perform once the cause(s) are
removed or cease.
15.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1 and 15.2, in no case shall a
Force Majeure Event excuse either Party from an obligation to pay money as
required by this Agreement.
15.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall require the non-performing Party to settle any
labor dispute except as the non-performing Party, in its sole discretion,
determines appropriate.
16. Forecasts
In addition to any other forecasts required by this Agreement, upon request by Verizon,
PN shall provide to Verizon forecasts regarding the Services that PN expects to purchase
from Verizon, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding the types and volumes of
Services that PN expects to purchase and the locations where such Services will be
purchased.
17. Fraud
PN assumes responsibility for all fraud associated with its Customers and accounts.
Verizon shall bear no responsibility for, and shall have no obligation to investigate or

make adjustments to PN's account in cases of, fraud by PN’s Customers or other third
parties.
18. Good Faith Performance
The Parties shall act in good faith in their performance of this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, where
consent, approval, agreement or a similar action is stated to be within a Party’s sole
discretion), where consent, approval, mutual agreement or a similar action is required by
any provision of this Agreement, such action shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If and, to the extent that, Verizon, prior to the Effective Date of
this Agreement, has not provided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a Service
offered under this Agreement, Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with
PN reasonable terms and conditions (including, without limitation, rates and
implementation timeframes) for such Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such
terms and conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes),
either Party may utilize the Agreement’s dispute resolution procedures.
19. Headings
The headings used in the Principal Document are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning of the Principal
Document.
20. Indemnification
20.1 Each Party (“Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
other Party (“Indemnified Party”), the Indemnified Party’s Affiliates, and the
directors, officers and employees of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified
Party’s Affiliates, from and against any and all Claims that arise out of bodily
injury to or death of any person, or damage to, or destruction or loss of, tangible
real and/or personal property of any person, to the extent such injury, death,
damage, destruction or loss, was proximately caused by the grossly negligent or
intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party’s Affiliates, or the directors, officers, employees, Agents or
contractors (excluding the Indemnified Party) of the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnifying Party’s Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement.
20.2 Indemnification Process.
20.2.1 As used in this Section 20, “Indemnified Person” means a person
whom an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify, defend and/or
hold harmless under Section 20.1.
20.2.2 An Indemnifying Party’s obligations under Section 20.1 shall be
conditioned upon the following:
20.2.3 The Indemnified Person: (a) shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of
the Claim promptly after becoming aware thereof (including a
statement of facts known to the Indemnified Person related to the
Claim and an estimate of the amount thereof); (b) prior to taking any
material action with respect to a Third Party Claim, shall consult with
the Indemnifying Party as to the procedure to be followed in defending,
settling, or compromising the Claim; (c) shall not consent to any
settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party; (d) shall permit the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (including, except

as provided below, the compromise or settlement thereof) at the
Indemnifying Party’s own cost and expense, provided, however, that
the Indemnified Person shall have the right to approve the
Indemnifying Party's choice of legal counsel.
20.2.4 If the Indemnified Person fails to comply with Section 20.2.3 with
respect to a Claim, to the extent such failure shall have a material
adverse effect upon the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be relieved of its obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Indemnified Person with respect to such Claim under this
Agreement.
20.2.5 Subject to 20.2.6 and 20.2.7, below, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the authority to defend and settle any Third Party Claim.
20.2.6 With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of the
Claim if the Claim requests equitable relief or other relief that could
affect the rights of the Indemnified Person. In so participating, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to employ separate counsel for the
defense at the Indemnified Person’s expense. The Indemnified Person
shall also be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense
of any Claim, as to any portion of the Claim as to which it is not entitled
to be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Indemnifying
Party.
20.2.7 In no event shall the Indemnifying Party settle a Third Party Claim or
consent to any judgment with regard to a Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event the
settlement or judgment requires a contribution from or affects the rights
of an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall have the right
to refuse such settlement or judgment with respect to itself and, at its
own cost and expense, take over the defense against the Third Party
Claim, provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless
the Indemnified Person against, the Third Party Claim for any amount
in excess of such refused settlement or judgment.
20.2.8 The Indemnified Person shall, in all cases, assert any and all
provisions in applicable Tariffs and Customer contracts that limit
liability to third persons as a bar to, or limitation on, any recovery by a
third-person claimant.
20.2.9 The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person shall offer each
other all reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense of any
Third Party Claim.
20.3 Each Party agrees that it will not implead or bring any action against the other
Party, the other Party’s Affiliates, or any of the directors, officers or employees of
the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliates, based on any claim by any person
for personal injury or death that occurs in the course or scope of employment of
such person by the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliate and that arises out of
performance of this Agreement.
20.4 Each Party’s obligations under this Section 20 shall survive expiration,
cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

21. Insurance
21.1 PN shall maintain during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two years
thereafter all insurance required to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement

21.2 Any deductibles, self-insured retentions or loss limits (“Retentions”) for the
foregoing insurance must be disclosed on the certificates of insurance to be
provided to Verizon pursuant to Sections 21.4 and 21.5, and Verizon reserves
the right to reject any such Retentions in its reasonable discretion. All Retentions
shall be the responsibility of PN.
21.3 PN shall name Verizon and Verizon’s Affiliates as additional insureds on the
foregoing liability insurance.
21.4 PN shall, within two (2) weeks of the Effective Date hereof at the time of each
renewal of, or material change in, PN’s insurance policies, and at such other
times as Verizon may reasonably specify, furnish certificates or other proof of the
foregoing insurance reasonably acceptable to Verizon. The certificates or other
proof of the foregoing insurance shall be sent to: Director-Negotiations, Verizon
Partner Solutions, 600 Hidden Ridge, HQEWMNOTICES, Irving, TX 75038.
21.5 PN shall require its contractors, if any, that may enter upon the premises or
access the facilities or equipment of Verizon or Verizon’s affiliates to maintain

to Verizon in accordance with Section 21.4.

of insurance as required in Sections 21.1 through 21.5, above, shall be deemed
a material breach of this Agreement.
21.7 Certificates furnished by PN or PN’s contractors shall contain a clause stating:
“Verizon Pennsylvania Inc. shall be notified in writing at least thirty (30) days prior
to cancellation of, or any material change in, the insurance.”
22. Intellectual Property
22.1 Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be
construed as granting a license with respect to any patent, copyright, trade
name, trademark, service mark, trade secret or any other intellectual property,
now or hereafter owned, controlled or licensable by either Party. Except as
expressly stated in this Agreement, neither Party may use any patent,
copyrightable materials, trademark, trade name, trade secret or other intellectual
property right, of the other Party except in accordance with the terms of a
separate license agreement between the Parties granting such rights.
22.2 Except as stated in Section 22.4, neither Party shall have any obligation to
defend, indemnify or hold harmless, or acquire any license or right for the benefit
of, or owe any other obligation or have any liability to, the other Party or its
Affiliates or Customers based on or arising from any Third Party Claim alleging or
asserting that the provision or use of any service, facility, arrangement, or
software by either Party under this Agreement, or the performance of any service
or method, either alone or in combination with the other Party, constitutes direct,
vicarious or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe, or misuse or
misappropriation of any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or any other
proprietary or intellectual property right of any Party or third person. Each Party,
however, shall offer to the other reasonable cooperation and assistance in the
defense of any such claim.
22.3 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT NEITHER PARTY HAS MADE, AND THAT THERE
DOES NOT EXIST, ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, THAT THE
USE BY EACH PARTY OF THE OTHER’S SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT GIVE RISE TO A CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT,
MISUSE, OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHT.
22.4 PN agrees that the Services provided by Verizon hereunder shall be subject to
the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in any applicable agreements
(including, but not limited to software or other intellectual property license
agreements) between Verizon and Verizon’s vendors. Verizon agrees to advise
PN, directly or through a third party, of any such terms, conditions or restrictions
that may limit any PN use of a Service provided by Verizon that is otherwise
permitted by this Agreement. At PN’s written request, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, Verizon will use Verizon’s best efforts, as commercially
practicable, to obtain intellectual property rights from Verizon’s vendor to allow
PN to use the Service in the same manner as Verizon that are coextensive with
Verizon’s intellectual property rights, on terms and conditions that are equal in
quality to the terms and conditions under which Verizon has obtained Verizon’s
intellectual property rights. PN shall reimburse Verizon for the cost of obtaining
such rights.
23. Joint Work Product

The Principal Document is the joint work product of the Parties, has been negotiated by
the Parties, and shall be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms. In the event of
any ambiguities, no inferences shall be drawn against either Party.

authorities to the full extent required or permitted by Applicable Law in matters
related to Services provided by it under this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, the production of records, the establishment of new lines or the installation of
new services on an existing line in order to support law enforcement and/or
national security operations, and, the installation of wiretaps, trap-and-trace
facilities and equipment, and dialed number recording facilities and equipment.
24.2 A Party shall not have the obligation to inform the other Party or the Customers
of the other Party of actions taken in cooperating with law enforcement or
national security authorities, except to the extent required by Applicable Law.
24.3 Where a law enforcement or national security request relates to the
establishment of lines (including, but not limited to, lines established to support
interception of communications on other lines), or the installation of other
services, facilities or arrangements, a Party may act to prevent the other Party
from obtaining access to information concerning such lines, services, facilities
and arrangements, through operations support system interfaces.
25. Liability
25.1 As used in this Section 25, “Service Failure” means a failure to comply with a

provision of any Services under this Agreement.
25.2 Except as otherwise stated in Section 25.5, the liability, if any, of a Party, a
Party’s Affiliates, and the directors, officers and employees of a Party and a
Party’s Affiliates, to the other Party, the other Party’s Customers, and to any
other person, for Claims arising out of a Service Failure shall not exceed an

subject to the Service Failure for the period in which such Service Failure occurs.
25.3 Except as otherwise stated in Section 25.5, a Party, a Party’s Affiliates, and the

Service Failure or any breach, delay or failure in performance, of this Agreement)
for special, indirect, incidental, consequential, reliance, exemplary, punitive, or
like damages, including, but not limited to, damages for lost revenues, profits or
savings, or other commercial or economic loss, even if the person whose liability
is excluded by this Section has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
25.4 The limitations and exclusions of liability stated in Sections 25.1 through 25.3
shall apply regardless of the form of a claim or action, whether statutory, in
contract, warranty, strict liability, tort (including, but not limited to, negligence of a
Party), or otherwise.
25.5 Nothing contained in Sections 25.1 through 25.4 shall exclude or limit liability:

25.6 In the event that the liability of a Party, a Party’s Affiliate, or a director, officer or
employee of a Party or a Party’s Affiliate, is limited and/or excluded under both
this Section 25 and a provision of an applicable Tariff, the liability of the Party or
other person shall be limited to the smaller of the amounts for which such Party
or other person would be liable under this Section or the Tariff provision.
25.7 Each Party shall, in its tariffs and other contracts with its Customers, provide that
in no case shall the other Party, the other Party’s Affiliates, or the directors,
officers or employees of the other Party or the other Party’s Affiliates, be liable to
such Customers or other third-persons for any special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, reliance, exemplary, punitive or other damages, arising out of a
Service Failure.
26. Network Management
26.1 Cooperation. The Parties will work cooperatively in a commercially reasonable
manner to install and maintain a reliable network. PN and Verizon will exchange
appropriate information (e.g., network information, maintenance contact
numbers, escalation procedures, and information required to comply with
requirements of law enforcement and national security agencies) to achieve this
desired reliability. In addition, the Parties will work cooperatively in a
commercially reasonable manner to apply sound network management principles
to alleviate or to prevent traffic congestion and subject to Section 17, to minimize
fraud associated with third number billed calls, calling card calls, and other
services related to this Agreement.
26.2 Responsibility for Following Standards. Each Party recognizes a responsibility to
follow the standards that may be agreed to between the Parties and to employ
characteristics and methods of operation that will not interfere with or impair the
service, network or facilities of the other Party or any third parties connected with
or involved directly in the network or facilities of the other.
26.3 Interference or Impairment. If a Party (“Impaired Party”) reasonably determines
that the services, network, facilities, or methods of operation, of the other Party
(“Interfering Party”) will or are likely to interfere with or impair the Impaired Party’s
provision of services or the operation of the Impaired Party’s network or facilities,
the Impaired Party may interrupt or suspend any Service provided to the

Interfering Party to the extent necessary to prevent such interference or
impairment, subject to the following:
26.3.1 Except in emergency situations (e.g., situations involving a risk of
bodily injury to persons or damage to tangible property, or an
interruption in Customer service) or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Impaired Party shall have given the Interfering Party at
least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the interference or
impairment or potential interference or impairment and the need to
correct the condition within said time period; and taken other actions, if
any, required by Applicable Law; and,
26.3.2 Upon correction of the interference or impairment, the Impaired Party
will promptly restore the interrupted or suspended Service. The
Impaired Party shall not be obligated to provide an out-of-service credit
allowance or other compensation to the Interfering Party in connection
with the suspended Service.

being provided by a Party hereunder, the Providing Party will follow Verizon’s
standard procedures for isolating and clearing the outage or trouble.
27. Non-Exclusive Remedies
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each of the remedies
provided under this Agreement is cumulative and is in addition to any other remedies that
may be available under this Agreement or at law or in equity.
28. Notice of Network Changes
If a Party makes a change in the information necessary for the transmission and routing
of services using that Party’s facilities or network, or any other change in its facilities or
network that will materially affect the interoperability of its facilities or network with the
other Party’s facilities or network, the Party making the change shall publish notice of the
change at least ninety (90) days in advance of such change, and shall use reasonable
efforts, as commercially practicable, to publish such notice at least one hundred eighty
(180) days in advance of the change; provided, however, that if an earlier publication of
notice of a change is required by Applicable Law (including, but not limited to, 47 CFR
51.325 through 51.335) notice shall be given at the time required by Applicable Law.

it would be purchased for a period of longer than one month, and such period
had not yet expired as of the Effective Date and the Service had not been
terminated prior to the Effective Date, to the extent not inconsistent with this

commitment.
33.3 If either Party elects to cancel the commitment pursuant to the proviso in Section

Purchasing Party, the Providing Party shall be entitled to payment from the
Purchasing Party of the difference between the price of the Service that was

Service that would have applied if the commitment had been to purchase the
Service only until the time that the commitment was cancelled.

beyond or to be performed after the expiration, cancellation or termination of this
Agreement, shall survive the expiration, cancellation or termination of this Agreement.
41. Taxes
41.1 In General. With respect to any purchase of Services under this Agreement, if
any federal, state or local tax, fee, surcharge or other tax-like charge, excluding
any tax levied on property or net income, (a "Tax") is required or permitted by
Applicable Law or a Tariff to be collected from the Purchasing Party by the
Providing Party, then (a) the Providing Party shall bill the Purchasing Party for

such Tax, as a separately stated item on the invoice, (b) the Purchasing Party
shall timely remit such Tax to the Providing Party and (c) the Providing Party
shall timely remit such collected Tax to the applicable taxing authority as and to
the extent required by Applicable Law.
41.2 Taxes Imposed on the Providing Party or Receipts. With respect to any
purchase of Services under this Agreement, if any federal, state or local Tax is
imposed by Applicable Law on the receipts of the Providing Party, and such
Applicable Law permits the Providing Party to exclude certain receipts received
from sales to a public utility, distributor, telephone company, local exchange
carrier, telecommunications company or other communications company
(“Telecommunications Company”), such exclusion being based on the fact that
the Purchasing Party is also subject to a tax based upon receipts (“Receipts
Tax”), then the Purchasing Party shall pay and remit the Receipts Tax as
required by Applicable Law.
41.3 Taxes Imposed on Subscriber. With respect to any purchase of Services under
this Agreement that are resold to a third party, if any federal, state or local Tax is
imposed by Applicable Law on the subscriber, end-user, customer or ultimate
consumer (“Subscriber”) in connection with any such purchase, which a
Telecommunications Company is required to impose and/or collect from a
Subscriber, or if any federal, state or local Tax is imposed on the Providing Party
and required by Applicable Law to be passed through to the Subscriber, then the
Purchasing Party (a) shall impose and/or collect such Tax from the Subscriber
and (b) shall timely remit such Tax to the applicable taxing authority.
41.4 Tax Exemptions and Exemption Certificates. If Applicable Law clearly exempts a
purchase hereunder from a Tax, and if such Applicable Law also provides an
exemption procedure, such as an exemption certificate requirement, then, if the
Purchasing Party complies with such procedure, the Providing Party shall not
collect such Tax during the effective period of such exemption. Such exemption
shall be effective upon receipt of the exemption certificate or affidavit in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section.41.7. If Applicable Law clearly
exempts a purchase hereunder from a Tax, but does not also provide an
exemption procedure, then the Providing Party shall not collect such Tax if the
Purchasing Party (a) furnishes the Providing Party with a letter signed by an
officer requesting such an exemption and citing the provision in the Applicable
Law which clearly allows such exemption and (b) supplies the Providing Party
with an indemnification agreement, acceptable to the Providing Party, which
holds the Providing Party harmless on an after-tax basis with respect to its
forbearing to collect such Tax.
41.5 Liability for Uncollected Tax, Interest and Penalty.
41.5.1 If the Providing Party has not received an exemption certificate from
the Purchasing Party and the Providing Party fails to bill the
Purchasing Party for any Tax as required by Section 41.1, then, as
between the Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, (a) the
Purchasing Party shall remain liable for such unbilled Tax and any
interest assessed thereon and (b) the Providing Party shall be liable for
any penalty assessed with respect to such unbilled Tax by a taxing
authority.
41.5.2 If the Providing Party properly bills the Purchasing Party for any Tax
but the Purchasing Party fails to remit such Tax to the Providing Party
as required by Section 41.2, then, as between the Providing Party and
the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall be liable for such

uncollected Tax and any interest assessed thereon, as well as any
penalty assessed with respect to such uncollected Tax by the
applicable taxing authority.
41.5.3 If the Providing Party does not collect any Tax as required by Section
41.1 because the Purchasing Party has provided such Providing Party
with an exemption certificate that is later found to be inadequate,
invalid or inapplicable by a taxing authority, then, as between the
Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall
be liable for such uncollected Tax and any interest assessed thereon,
as well as any penalty assessed with respect to such uncollected Tax
by the applicable taxing authority.
41.5.4 If the Purchasing Party fails to pay the Receipts Tax as required by
Section 41.2, then, as between the Providing Party and the Purchasing
Party, (a) the Providing Party shall be liable for any Tax imposed on its
receipts and (b) the Purchasing Party shall be liable for any interest
assessed thereon and any penalty assessed upon the Providing Party
with respect to such Tax by the applicable taxing authority.
41.5.5 If the Purchasing Party fails to impose and/or collect any Tax from
Subscribers as required by Section 41.3, then, as between the
Providing Party and the Purchasing Party, the Purchasing Party shall
remain liable for such uncollected Tax and any interest assessed
thereon, as well as any penalty assessed with respect to such
uncollected Tax by the applicable taxing authority. With respect to any
Tax that the Purchasing Party has agreed to pay, or is required to
impose on and/or collect from Subscribers, the Purchasing Party
agrees to indemnify and hold the Providing Party harmless on an after-
tax basis for any costs incurred by the Providing Party as a result of
actions taken by the applicable taxing authority to recover the Tax from
the Providing Party due to the failure of the Purchasing Party to timely
pay, or collect and timely remit, such Tax to such authority.
41.6 Audit Cooperation. In the event either Party is audited by a taxing authority, the
other Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Party being audited in order to
respond to any audit inquiries in a proper and timely manner so that the audit
and/or any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.
41.7 Notices. All notices, affidavits, exemption-certificates or other communications
required or permitted to be given by either Party to the other, for purposes of this
Section41, shall be made in writing and shall be delivered in person or sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or registered mail, or a courier service
providing proof of service, and sent to the addressees set forth in Section 29 as
well as to the following:

10.5 If service on a VTS provided by Verizon to PN under this Agreement is
terminated and the telephone numbers associated with such VTS have not been
ported to a PN switch, the telephone numbers shall be available for reassignment

by Verizon to any person to whom Verizon elects to assign the telephone
numbers, including, but not limited to, Verizon, Verizon Customers, PN, or
Telecommunications Carriers other than Verizon and PN.
10.6 PN may reserve telephone numbers only to the extent Verizon’s Customers may
reserve telephone numbers.
11. Routing for Operator Services and Directory Assistance Traffic
For a Verizon Telecommunications Service dial tone line purchased by PN for resale
pursuant to the Resale Attachment, upon request by PN, Verizon will establish an
arrangement that will permit PN to route the PN Customer’s calls for operator and
directory assistance services to a provider of operator and directory assistance services
selected by PN. Verizon will provide this routing arrangement in accordance with, but
only to the extent required by, Applicable Law. Verizon will provide this routing
arrangement pursuant to an appropriate written request submitted by PN and a mutually
agreed-upon schedule. This routing arrangement will be implemented at PN's expense,
with charges determined on an individual case basis. In addition to charges for initially
establishing the routing arrangement, PN will be responsible for ongoing monthly and/or
usage charges for the routing arrangement. PN shall arrange, at its own expense, the
trunking and other facilities required to transport traffic to PN’s selected provider of
operator and directory assistance services.
12. Unauthorized Carrier Change Charges
In the event either Party requests that the other Party install, provide, change, or
terminate a Customer’s Telecommunications Service (including, but not limited to, a
Customer’s selection of a primary Telephone Exchange Service Provider) without having
obtained authorization from the Customer for such installation, provision, selection,
change or termination in accordance with Applicable Laws, the requesting Party shall be
liable to the other Party for all charges that would be applicable to the Customer for the
initial change in the Customer’s Telecommunications Service and any charges for
restoring the Customer’s Telecommunications Service to its Customer-authorized
condition (all such charges together, the “Carrier Change Charges”), including to the
appropriate primary Telephone Exchange Service provider. Such Carrier Change
Charges may be assessed on the requesting Party by the other Party at any time after
the Customer is restored to its Customer-authorized condition.
13. Good Faith Performance
If and, to the extent that, Verizon, prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, has not
provided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a Service offered under this Attachment,
Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with PN reasonable terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes) for such
Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either Party may utilize the Agreement’s
dispute resolution procedures.

INTERCONNECTION ATTACHMENT
1. General
Each Party shall provide to the other Party, in accordance with this Agreement, but only
to the extent required by Applicable Law, interconnection at (i) any technically feasible
Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA and/or (ii) a fiber meet point to
which the Parties mutually agree under the terms of this Agreement, for the transmission
and routing of Telephone Exchange Service and Exchange Access. By way of example,
a technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA would
include an applicable Verizon Tandem Interconnection Wire Center or Verizon End Office
Interconnection Wire Center but, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
or otherwise, would not include a PN Interconnection Wire Center, PN switch or any
portion of a transport facility provided by Verizon to PN or another party between (x) a
Verizon Interconnection Wire Center or switch and (y) the Interconnection Wire Center or
switch of PN or another party. For brevity’s sake, the foregoing examples of locations
that, respectively, are and are not “on Verizon’s network” shall apply (and are hereby
incorporated by reference) each time the term “on Verizon’s network” is used in this
Agreement.
2. Points of Interconnection and Trunk Types
2.1 Point(s) of Interconnection.
2.1.1 Each Party, at its own expense, shall provide transport facilities to the
technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in
a LATA selected by PN.
2.2 Trunk Types.
2.2.1 In interconnecting their networks pursuant to this Attachment, the
Parties will use, as appropriate, the following separate and distinct
trunk groups:
2.2.1.1 Interconnection Trunks for the transmission and routing of
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic, translated LEC IntraLATA
toll free service access code (e.g., 800/888/877) traffic, and
IntraLATA Toll Traffic, between their respective Telephone
Exchange Service Customers, Tandem Transit Traffic, and,
Measured Internet Traffic, all in accordance with Sections 5
through 8 of this Attachment;
2.2.1.2 Access Toll Connecting Trunks for the transmission and
routing of Exchange Access traffic, including translated
InterLATA toll free service access code (e.g., 800/888/877)
traffic, between PN Telephone Exchange Service
Customers and purchasers of Switched Exchange Access
Service via a Verizon access Tandem in accordance with
Sections 9 through 11 of this Attachment; and
2.2.1.3 Miscellaneous Trunk Groups as mutually agreed to by the
Parties, including, but not limited to: (a) choke trunks for
traffic congestion and testing; and, (b) untranslated
IntraLATA/InterLATA toll free service access code (e.g.
800/888/877) traffic.

2.2.2 Other types of trunk groups may be used by the Parties as provided in
other Attachments to this Agreement (e.g., 911/E-911 Trunks) or in
other separate agreements between the Parties (e.g., directory
assistance trunks, operator services trunks, BLV/BLVI trunks or trunks
for 500/555 traffic).
2.2.3 In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Parties will deploy
One-Way Interconnection Trunks (trunks with traffic going in one
direction, including one-way trunks and uni-directional two-way trunks)
and/or Two-Way Interconnection Trunks (trunks with traffic going in
both directions).
2.2.4 PN shall establish, at the technically feasible Point(s) of
Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA, separate
Interconnection Trunk group(s) between such POI(s) and each Verizon
Tandem in a LATA with a subtending End Office(s) to which PN
originates calls for Verizon to terminate.
2.2.5 In the event the volume of traffic between a Verizon End Office and a
technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a
LATA, which is carried by a Final Tandem Interconnection Trunk
group, exceeds (a) the Centum Call Seconds (Hundred Call Seconds)
busy hour equivalent of one (1) DS1 at any time; (b) 200,000 minutes
of use for a single month; and/or; (c) 600 busy hour Centum Call
Seconds (BHCCS) of use for a single month: (i) if One-Way
Interconnection Trunks are used, the originating Party shall promptly
establish new or augment existing End Office One-Way
Interconnection Trunk groups between the Verizon End Office and the
technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s network; or,
(ii) if Two-Way Interconnection Trunks are used, PN shall promptly
submit an ASR to Verizon to establish new or augment existing End
Office Two-Way Interconnection Trunk group(s) between that Verizon
End Office and the technically feasible Point of Interconnection on
Verizon’s network.
2.2.6 Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the total number
of Tandem Interconnection Trunks between a technically feasible Point
of Interconnection on Verizon’s network and a Verizon Tandem will be
limited to a maximum of 240 trunks. In the event that the volume of
traffic between a technically feasible Point of Interconnection on
Verizon’s network and a Verizon Tandem exceeds, or reasonably can
be expected to exceed, the capacity of the 240 trunks, PN shall
promptly submit an ASR to Verizon to establish new or additional End
Office Trunks to insure that the volume of traffic between the
technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s network and
the Verizon Tandem does not exceed the capacity of the 240 trunks.
2.3 One-Way Interconnection Trunks.
2.3.1 Where the Parties use One-Way Interconnection Trunks for the
delivery of traffic from PN to Verizon, PN, at PN’s own expense, shall:
2.3.1.1 provide its own facilities for delivery of the traffic to the
technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s
network in a LATA; and/or

2.3.1.2 obtain transport for delivery of the traffic to the technically
feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in
a LATA (a) from a third party, or, (b) if Verizon offers such
transport pursuant to a Verizon access Tariff, from Verizon.
2.3.2 For each Tandem or End Office One-Way Interconnection Trunk group
for delivery of traffic from PN to Verizon with a utilization level of less
than sixty percent (60%) for final trunk groups and eighty-five percent
(85%) for high usage trunk groups, unless the Parties agree otherwise,
PN will promptly submit ASRs to disconnect a sufficient number of
Interconnection Trunks to attain a utilization level of approximately
sixty percent (60%) for all final trunk groups and eighty-five percent
(85%) for all high usage trunk groups. In the event PN fails to submit
an ASR to disconnect One-Way Interconnection Trunks as required by
this Section, Verizon may disconnect the excess Interconnection
Trunks or bill (and PN shall pay) for the excess Interconnection Trunks
at the rates set forth in the Pricing Attachment.
2.3.3 Where the Parties use One-Way Interconnection Trunks for the
delivery of traffic from Verizon to PN, Verizon, at Verizon’s own
expense, shall provide its own facilities for delivery of the traffic to the
technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in
a LATA.
2.4 Two-Way Interconnection Trunks.
2.4.1 Where the Parties use Two-Way Interconnection Trunks for the
exchange of traffic between Verizon and PN, PN, at its own expense,
shall:
2.4.1.1 provide its own facilities to the technically feasible Point(s)
of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA; and/or
2.4.1.2 obtain transport to the technically feasible Point(s) of
Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA (a) from a
third party, or, (b) if Verizon offers such transport pursuant
to a Verizon access Tariff, from Verizon.
2.4.2 Where the Parties use Two-Way Interconnection Trunks for the
exchange of traffic between Verizon and PN, Verizon, at its own
expense, shall provide its own facilities to the technically feasible
Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA.
2.4.3 Prior to establishing any Two-Way Interconnection Trunks, PN shall
meet with Verizon to conduct a joint planning meeting (“Joint Planning
Meeting”). At that Joint Planning Meeting, each Party shall provide to
the other Party originating Centum Call Seconds (Hundred Call
Seconds) information, and the Parties shall mutually agree on the
appropriate initial number of End Office and Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks and the interface specifications at the
technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in
a LATA at which the Parties interconnect for the exchange of traffic.
Where the Parties have agreed to convert existing One-Way
Interconnection Trunks to Two-Way Interconnection Trunks, at the
Joint Planning Meeting, the Parties shall also mutually agree on the
conversion process and project intervals for conversion of such One-
Way Interconnection Trunks to Two-Way Interconnection Trunks.

2.4.4 On a semi-annual basis, PN shall submit a good faith forecast to
Verizon of the number of End Office and Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks that PN anticipates Verizon will need to provide
during the ensuing two (2) year period for the exchange of traffic
between PN and Verizon. PN’s trunk forecasts shall conform to the
Verizon CLEC trunk forecasting guidelines as in effect at that time.
2.4.5 The Parties shall meet (telephonically or in person) from time to time,
as needed, to review data on End Office and Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks to determine the need for new trunk groups
and to plan any necessary changes in the number of Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks.
2.4.6 Two-Way Interconnection Trunks shall have SS7 Common Channel
Signaling. The Parties agree to utilize B8ZS and Extended Super
Frame (ESF) DS1 facilities, where available.
2.4.7 With respect to End Office Two-Way Interconnection Trunks, both
Parties shall use an economic Centum Call Seconds (Hundred Call
Seconds) equal to five (5). Either Party may disconnect End Office
Two-Way Interconnection Trunks that, based on reasonable
engineering criteria and capacity constraints, are not warranted by the
actual traffic volume experienced.
2.4.8 Two-Way Interconnection Trunk groups that connect to a Verizon
access Tandem shall be engineered using a design blocking objective
of Neal-Wilkinson B.005 during the average time consistent busy hour.
Two-Way Interconnection Trunk groups that connect to a Verizon local
Tandem shall be engineered using a design blocking objective of Neal-
Wilkinson B.01 during the average time consistent busy hour. Verizon
and PN shall engineer Two-Way Interconnection Trunks using
Telcordia Notes on the Networks SR 2275 (formerly known as BOC
Notes on the LEC Networks SR-TSV-002275).
2.4.9 The performance standard for final Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
groups shall be that no such Interconnection Trunk group will exceed
its design blocking objective (B.005 or B.01, as applicable) for three (3)
consecutive calendar traffic study months.
2.4.10 PN shall determine and order the number of Two-Way Interconnection
Trunks that are required to meet the applicable design blocking
objective for all traffic carried on each Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
group. PN shall order Two-Way Interconnection Trunks by submitting
ASRs to Verizon setting forth the number of Two-Way Interconnection
Trunks to be installed and the requested installation dates within
Verizon’s effective standard intervals or negotiated intervals, as
appropriate. PN shall complete ASRs in accordance with OBF
Guidelines as in effect from time to time.
2.4.11 Verizon may (but shall not be obligated to) monitor Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk groups using service results for the applicable
design blocking objective. If Verizon observes blocking in excess of
the applicable design objective on any Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk group and PN has not notified Verizon that it has
corrected such blocking, Verizon may submit to PN a Trunk Group
Service Request directing PN to remedy the blocking. Upon receipt of
a Trunk Group Service Request, PN will complete an ASR to establish

or augment the End Office Two-Way Interconnection Trunk group(s),
or, if mutually agreed, to augment the Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk group with excessive blocking and submit the
ASR to Verizon within five (5) Business Days.
2.4.12 The Parties will review all Tandem Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
groups that reach a utilization level of seventy percent (70%), or
greater, to determine whether those groups should be augmented. PN
will promptly augment all Tandem Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
groups that reach a utilization level of eighty percent (80%) by
submitting ASRs for additional trunks sufficient to attain a utilization
level of approximately seventy percent (70%), unless the Parties agree
that additional trunking is not required. For each Tandem Two-Way
Interconnection Trunk group with a utilization level of less than sixty
percent (60%), unless the Parties agree otherwise, PN will promptly
submit ASRs to disconnect a sufficient number of Interconnection
Trunks to attain a utilization level of approximately sixty percent (60%)
for each respective group, unless the Parties agree that the Two-Way
Interconnection Trunks should not be disconnected. In the event PN
fails to submit an ASR for Two-Way Interconnection Trunks in
conformance with this Section, Verizon may disconnect the excess
Interconnection Trunks or bill (and PN shall pay) for the excess
Interconnection Trunks at the applicable Verizon rates.
2.4.13 Because Verizon will not be in control of when and how many Two-
Way Interconnection Trunks are established between its network and
PN’s network, Verizon’s performance in connection with these Two-
Way Interconnection Trunk groups shall not be subject to any
performance measurements and remedies under this Agreement, and,
except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, under any FCC or
Commission approved carrier-to-carrier performance assurance
guidelines or plan.
2.4.14 PN will route its traffic to Verizon over the End Office and Tandem
Two-Way Interconnection Trunks in accordance with SR-TAP-000191,
including but not limited to those standards requiring that a call from
PN to a Verizon End Office will first be routed to the End Office
Interconnection Trunk group between PN and the Verizon End Office.
3. Alternative Interconnection Arrangements
3.1 Fiber Meet Arrangement Provisions.
3.1.1 Each Party may request a Fiber Meet arrangement by providing written
notice thereof to the other Party if each of the following conditions has
been met: (a) the Parties have consistently been exchanging an
amount of applicable traffic (as set forth in Section 3.1.3 below) in the
relevant exchanges equal to at least one (1) DS-3 and (b) neither PN
nor any of PN’s affiliates has an overdue balance on any bill rendered
to PN or PN’s affiliates for charges that are not subject to a good faith
dispute. Any such Fiber Meet arrangement shall be subject to the
terms of this Agreement. In addition, the establishment of any Fiber
Meet arrangement is expressly conditioned upon the Parties mutually
agreeing to the technical specifications and requirements for such
Fiber Meet arrangement including, but not limited to, the location of the
Fiber Meet points, routing, equipment (e.g., specifications of Add/Drop
Multiplexers, number of strands of fiber, etc.), software, ordering,

provisioning, maintenance, repair, testing, augment and on any other
technical specifications or requirements necessary to implement the
Fiber Meet arrangement. For each Fiber Meet arrangement the
Parties agree to implement, the Parties will complete and sign a
Technical Specifications and Requirements document, the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A to Section 3 of the
Interconnection Attachment Fiber Meet Arrangement Provisions. Each
such document will be treated as Confidential Information.
3.1.2 The Parties agree to consider the possibility of using existing fiber
cable with spare capacity, where available, to implement any such
request for a Fiber Meet arrangement. If existing fiber cable with spare
capacity is not available, the Parties agree to minimize the construction
and deployment of fiber cable necessary for any Fiber Meet
arrangement to which they agree. Except as otherwise agreed by the
Parties, any and all Fiber Meet points established between the Parties
shall extend no further than three (3) miles from an applicable Verizon
Tandem or End Office and Verizon shall not be required to construct or
deploy more than five hundred (500) feet of fiber cable for a Fiber Meet
arrangement.
3.1.3 A Fiber Meet arrangement established under this Agreement may be
used for the transmission and routing of only the following traffic types
(over the Interconnection Trunks):
3.1.3.1 Reciprocal Compensation Traffic between the Parties’
respective Telephone Exchange Service Customers;
3.1.3.2 Translated LEC IntraLATA toll free service access code
(e.g., 800/888/877) traffic between the Parties’ respective
Telephone Exchange Service Customers;
3.1.3.3 IntraLATA Toll Traffic between the Parties’ respective
Telephone Exchange Service Customers;
3.1.3.4 Tandem Transit Traffic; and
3.1.3.5 Measured Internet Traffic.
To the extent that a Fiber Meet arrangement established under this
Agreement is used for the transmission and routing of traffic of the
types set forth in Sections 3.1.3.1 and/or 3.1.3.5, other than the
obligation to pay intercarrier compensation charges pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement, neither Party shall have any obligation to pay
the other Party any charges in connection with any Fiber Meet
arrangements established under this Agreement. To the extent that a
Fiber Meet arrangement established under this Agreement is used for
the transmission and routing of traffic of the type set forth in Section
3.1.3.2, the transport and termination of such traffic shall be subject to
the rates and charges set forth in the Agreement and applicable
Tariffs. To the extent that a Fiber Meet arrangement established
under this Agreement is used for the transmission and routing of traffic
of the type set forth in Section 3.1.3.3, the Party originating such traffic
shall compensate the terminating Party for the transport and
termination of such traffic at the rates and charges set forth in the
Agreement and applicable Tariffs. To the extent that a Fiber Meet
arrangement established under this Agreement is used for the

transmission and routing of traffic of the type set forth in Section
3.1.3.4, Verizon shall charge (and PN shall pay) Verizon’s applicable
rates and charges as set forth in the Agreement and Verizon’s
applicable Tariffs, including transport charges to the terminating
Verizon Tandem.
3.1.4 At PN’s written request, a Fiber Meet arrangement established under
this Agreement may be used for the transmission and routing of the
following traffic types over the following trunk types:
3.1.4.1 Operator services traffic from PN’s Telephone Exchange
Service Customers to an operator services provider over
operator services trunks;
3.1.4.2 Directory assistance traffic from PN’s Telephone Exchange
Service Customers to a directory assistance provider over
directory assistance trunks;

including translated InterLATA toll free service access code
(e.g., 800/888/877) traffic, between PN’s Telephone
Exchange Service Customers and third-party purchasers of
Switched Exchange Access Service via a Verizon access
Tandem over Access Toll Connecting Trunks.
To the extent that a Fiber Meet arrangement established under this
Agreement is used for the transmission and routing of any traffic of the
types set forth in this Section 3.1.4 Verizon may bill (and PN shall pay)
Verizon’s applicable Tariff rates and charges. Except as otherwise
agreed in writing by the Parties or as expressly set forth in Sections
3.1.3 and/or 3.1.4 of this Interconnection Attachment, access services
(switched and unswitched) and unbundled network elements shall not
be provisioned on or accessed through Fiber Meet arrangements.
3.1.5 PN will include traffic to be exchanged over Fiber Meet arrangements
in its forecasts provided to Verizon under the Agreement.
4. Initiating Interconnection
4.1 If PN determines to offer Telephone Exchange Services and to interconnect with
Verizon in any LATA in which Verizon also offers Telephone Exchange Services
and in which the Parties are not already interconnected pursuant to this
Agreement, PN shall provide written notice to Verizon of the need to establish
Interconnection in such LATA pursuant to this Agreement.
4.2 The notice provided in Section 4.1 of this Attachment shall include (a) the initial
Routing Point(s); (b) the applicable technically feasible Point(s) of
Interconnection on Verizon’s network to be established in the relevant LATA in
accordance with this Agreement; (c) PN’s intended Interconnection activation
date; (d) a forecast of PN’s trunking requirements conforming to Section 14.2 of
this Attachment; and (e) such other information as Verizon shall reasonably
request in order to facilitate Interconnection.

4.3 The interconnection activation date in the new LATA shall be mutually agreed to
by the Parties after receipt by Verizon of all necessary information as indicated
above. Within ten (10) Business Days of Verizon’s receipt of PN’s notice
provided for in Section 4.1 of this Attachment, Verizon and PN shall confirm the
technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in the new
LATA and the mutually agreed upon Interconnection activation date for the new
LATA.
5. Transmission and Routing of Telephone Exchange Service Traffic
5.1 Scope of Traffic.
Section5 prescribes parameters for Interconnection Trunks used for
Interconnection pursuant to Sections 2 through 4 of this Attachment.
5.2 Trunk Group Connections and Ordering.
5.2.1 For both One-Way and Two-Way Interconnection Trunks, if PN wishes
to use a technically feasible interface other than a DS1 or a DS3 facility
at the POI, the Parties shall negotiate reasonable terms and conditions
(including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes) for
such arrangement; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation
timeframes), either Party may utilize the Agreement’s dispute
resolution procedures.
5.2.2 When One-Way or Two-Way Interconnection Trunks are provisioned
using a DS3 interface facility, if PN orders the multiplexed DS3
facilities to a Verizon Central Office that is not designated in the NECA
4 Tariff as the appropriate Intermediate Hub location (i.e., the
Intermediate Hub location in the appropriate Tandem subtending area
based on the LERG), and the provision of such facilities to the subject
Central Office is technically feasible, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith reasonable terms and conditions (including, without limitation,
rates and implementation timeframes) for such arrangement; and, if
the Parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions (including,
without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either Party
may utilize the Agreement’s dispute resolution procedures.
5.2.3 Each Party will identify its Carrier Identification Code, a three or four
digit numeric code obtained from Telcordia, to the other Party when
ordering a trunk group.
5.2.4 For multi-frequency (MF) signaling each Party will out pulse ten (10)
digits to the other Party, unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise.
5.2.5 Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to monitor trunk
groups under its control and to augment those groups using generally
accepted trunk-engineering standards so as to not exceed blocking
objectives. Each Party agrees to use modular trunk-engineering
techniques for trunks subject to this Attachment.
5.3 Switching System Hierarchy and Trunking Requirements.
For purposes of routing PN traffic to Verizon, the subtending arrangements
between Verizon Tandems and Verizon End Offices shall be the same as the
Tandem/End Office subtending arrangements Verizon maintains for the routing

of its own or other carriers’ traffic (i.e., traffic will be routed to the appropriate
Verizon Tandem subtended by the terminating End Office serving the Verizon
Customer). For purposes of routing Verizon traffic to PN, the subtending
arrangements between PN Tandems and PN End Offices shall be the same as
the Tandem/End Office subtending arrangements that PN maintains for the
routing of its own or other carriers’ traffic.
5.4 Signaling.
Each Party will provide the other Party with access to its databases and
associated signaling necessary for the routing and completion of the other
Party’s traffic in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and any
applicable Tariff.
5.5 Grades of Service.
The Parties shall initially engineer and shall monitor and augment all trunk
groups consistent with the Joint Process as set forth in Section 14.1 of this
Attachment.
6. Traffic Measurement and Billing over Interconnection Trunks
6.1 For billing purposes, each Party shall pass Calling Party Number (CPN)
information on at least ninety-five percent (95%) of calls carried over the
Interconnection Trunks.
6.1.1 As used in this Section 6, “Traffic Rate” means the applicable
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic rate, Measured Internet Traffic rate,
intrastate Switched Exchange Access Service rate, interstate Switched
Exchange Access Service rate, or intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
Traffic rate, as provided in the Pricing Attachment, an applicable Tariff,
or, for Measured Internet Traffic, the FCC Internet Order.
6.1.2 If the originating Party passes CPN on ninety-five percent (95%) or
more of its calls, the receiving Party shall bill the originating Party the
Traffic Rate applicable to each relevant minute of traffic for which CPN
is passed. For any remaining (up to 5%) calls without CPN
information, the receiving Party shall bill the originating Party for such
traffic at the Traffic Rate applicable to each relevant minute of traffic, in
direct proportion to the minutes of use of calls passed with CPN
information.
6.1.3 If the originating Party passes CPN on less than ninety-five percent
(95%) of its calls and the originating Party chooses to combine
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic and Toll Traffic on the same trunk
group, the receiving Party shall bill the higher of its interstate Switched
Exchange Access Service rates or its intrastate Switched Exchange
Access Services rates for all traffic that is passed without CPN, unless
the Parties agree that other rates should apply to such traffic.
6.2 At such time as a receiving Party has the capability, on an automated basis, to
use such CPN to classify traffic delivered over Interconnection Trunks by the
other Party by Traffic Rate type (e.g., Reciprocal Compensation Traffic/Measured
Internet Traffic, intrastate Switched Exchange Access Service, interstate
Switched Exchange Access Service, or intrastate/interstate Tandem Transit
Traffic), such receiving Party shall bill the originating Party the Traffic Rate
applicable to each relevant minute of traffic for which CPN is passed. If the

receiving Party lacks the capability, on an automated basis, to use CPN
information on an automated basis to classify traffic delivered by the other Party
by Traffic Rate type, the originating Party will supply Traffic Factor 1 and Traffic
Factor 2. The Traffic Factors shall be supplied in writing by the originating Party
within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date and shall be updated in writing by the
originating Party quarterly. Measurement of billing minutes for purposes of
determining terminating compensation shall be in conversation seconds (the time
in seconds that the Parties equipment is used for a completed call, measured
from the receipt of answer supervision to the receipt of disconnect supervision).
Measurement of billing minutes for originating toll free service access code (e.g.,
800/888/877) calls shall be in accordance with applicable Tariffs. Determination
as to whether traffic is Reciprocal Compensation Traffic or Measured Internet
Traffic shall be made in accordance with Paragraphs 8 and 79, and other
applicable provisions, of the FCC Internet Order (including, but not limited to, in
accordance with the rebuttable presumption established by the FCC Internet
Order that traffic delivered to a carrier that exceeds a 3:1 ratio of terminating to
originating traffic is Measured Internet Traffic, and in accordance with the
process established by the FCC Internet Order for rebutting such presumption
before the Commission).
6.3 Each Party reserves the right to audit all Traffic, up to a maximum of two audits
per Calendar Year, to ensure that rates are being applied appropriately;
provided, however, that either Party shall have the right to conduct additional
audit(s) if the preceding audit disclosed material errors or discrepancies. Each
Party agrees to provide the necessary Traffic data in conjunction with any such
audit in a timely manner.
6.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either Party’s ability to
designate the areas within which that Party’s Customers may make calls which
that Party rates as “local” in its Customer Tariffs.
6.5 If and, to the extent that, a PN Customer receives V/FX Traffic, PN shall promptly
provide notice thereof to Verizon (such notice to include, without limitation, the
specific telephone number(s) that the Customer uses for V/FX Traffic, as well as
the LATA in which the Customer’s station is actually physically located) and shall
not bill Verizon Reciprocal Compensation, intercarrier compensation or any other
charges for calls placed by Verizon’s Customers to such PN Customers.
7. Reciprocal Compensation Arrangements Pursuant to Section 251(b)(5) of the Act
7.1 Reciprocal Compensation.
The Parties shall exchange Reciprocal Compensation Traffic at the technically
feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA designated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Party originating Reciprocal
Compensation Traffic shall compensate the terminating Party for the transport
and termination of such traffic to its Customer in accordance with Section
251(b)(5) of the Act at the equal and symmetrical rates stated in the Pricing
Attachment; it being understood and agreed that Verizon shall charge (and PN
shall pay Verizon) the End Office Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the
Pricing Attachment for Reciprocal Compensation Traffic PN physically delivers to
a POI at the Verizon Interconnection Wire Center in which the terminating
Verizon End Office is located, and otherwise that Verizon shall charge (PN shall
pay Verizon) the Tandem Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the Pricing
Attachment for Reciprocal Compensation Traffic PN delivers to Verizon; it also
being understood and agreed that PN shall charge (and Verizon shall pay PN)
the End Office Reciprocal Compensation rate set forth in the Pricing Attachment

for Reciprocal Compensation Traffic Verizon delivers to PN. These rates are to
be applied at the technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s
network in a LATA at which the Parties interconnect, whether such traffic is
delivered by Verizon for termination by PN, or delivered by PN for termination by
Verizon. No additional charges shall be assessed by the terminating Party for
the transport and termination of such traffic from the technically feasible Point(s)
of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA to its Customer; provided,
however, for the avoidance of any doubt, PN shall also pay Verizon, at the rates
set forth in the Pricing Attachment, for any multiplexing, cross connects or other
collocation related Services that PN obtains from Verizon. When Toll Traffic is
delivered over the same Interconnection Trunks as Reciprocal Compensation
Traffic, any port, transport or other applicable access charges related to the
delivery of Toll Traffic from the technically feasible Point of Interconnection on
Verizon’s network in a LATA to the terminating Party’s Customer shall be
prorated so as to apply only to the Toll Traffic. The designation of traffic as
Reciprocal Compensation Traffic for purposes of Reciprocal Compensation shall
be based on the actual originating and terminating points of the complete end-to-
end communication.
7.2 Traffic Not Subject to Reciprocal Compensation.
7.2.1 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to interstate or intrastate
Exchange Access (including, without limitation, Virtual Foreign
Exchange Traffic (i.e., V/FX Traffic), Information Access, or exchange
services for Exchange Access or Information Access.
7.2.2 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Internet Traffic.
7.2.3 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Toll Traffic, including, but
not limited to, calls originated on a 1+ presubscription basis, or on a
casual dialed (10XXX/101XXXX) basis.
7.2.4 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Optional Extended Local
Calling Scope Arrangement Traffic.
7.2.5 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to special access, private
line, or any other traffic that is not switched by the terminating Party.
7.2.6 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Tandem Transit Traffic.
7.2.7 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Voice Information Service
Traffic (as defined in Section 5 of the Additional Services Attachment).
7.2.8 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to traffic that is not subject to
Reciprocal Compensation under Section 251(b)(5) of the Act.
7.2.9 Reciprocal Compensation shall not apply to Virtual Foreign Exchange
Traffic (i.e., V/FX Traffic). As used in this Agreement, “Virtual Foreign
Exchange Traffic” or “V/FX Traffic” is defined as calls in which a PN
Customer is assigned a telephone number with an NXX Code (as set
forth in the LERG) associated with an exchange that is different than
the exchange (as set forth in the LERG) associated with the actual
physical location of such Customer’s station. For the avoidance of any
doubt, PN shall pay Verizon’s originating access charges for all V/FX
Traffic originated by a Verizon Customer, and PN shall pay Verizon’s
terminating access charges for all V/FX Traffic originated by a PN
Customer.

7.3 The Reciprocal Compensation rates (including, but not limited to, the Reciprocal
Compensation per minute of use charges) billed by PN to Verizon shall not
exceed the Reciprocal Compensation rates (including, but not limited to,
Reciprocal Compensation per minute of use charges) billed by Verizon to PN.
8. Other Types of Traffic
8.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Tariff: (a) the
Parties’ rights and obligations with respect to any intercarrier compensation that
may be due in connection with their exchange of Internet Traffic shall be
governed by the terms of the FCC Internet Order and other applicable FCC
orders and FCC Regulations; and, (b) a Party shall not be obligated to pay any
intercarrier compensation for Internet Traffic that is in excess of the intercarrier
compensation for Internet Traffic that such Party is required to pay under the
FCC Internet Order and other applicable FCC orders and FCC Regulations.
8.2 Subject to Section 8.1 of this Attachment, interstate and intrastate Exchange
Access, Information Access, exchange services for Exchange Access or
Information Access, and Toll Traffic, shall be governed by the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and applicable Tariffs.
8.3 For any traffic originating with a third party carrier and delivered by PN to
Verizon, PN shall pay Verizon the same amount that such third party carrier
would have been obligated to pay Verizon for termination of that traffic at the
location the traffic is delivered to Verizon by PN.
8.4 Any traffic not specifically addressed in this Agreement shall be treated as
required by the applicable Tariff of the Party transporting and/or terminating the
traffic.
8.5 The Parties may also exchange Internet Traffic at the technically feasible Point(s)
of Interconnection on Verizon’s network in a LATA established hereunder for the
exchange of Reciprocal Compensation Traffic. Any intercarrier compensation
that may be due in connection with the Parties’ exchange of Internet Traffic shall
be applied at such technically feasible Point of Interconnection on Verizon’s
network in a LATA in accordance with the FCC Internet Order.
9. Transmission and Routing of Exchange Access Traffic
9.1 Scope of Traffic.
Section9 prescribes parameters for certain trunks to be established over the
Interconnections specified in Sections 2 through 5 of this Attachment for the
transmission and routing of traffic between PN Telephone Exchange Service
Customers and Interexchange Carriers (“Access Toll Connecting Trunks”), in any
case where PN elects to have its End Office Switch subtend a Verizon Tandem.
This includes casually-dialed (1010XXX and 101XXXX) traffic.
9.2 Access Toll Connecting Trunk Group Architecture.
9.2.1 If PN chooses to subtend a Verizon access Tandem, PN’s NPA/NXX
must be assigned by PN to subtend the same Verizon access Tandem
that a Verizon NPA/NXX serving the same Rate Center Area subtends
as identified in the LERG.
9.2.2 PN shall establish Access Toll Connecting Trunks pursuant to
applicable access Tariffs by which it will provide Switched Exchange

Access Services to Interexchange Carriers to enable such
Interexchange Carriers to originate and terminate traffic to and from
PN’s Customers.
9.2.3 The Access Toll Connecting Trunks shall be two-way trunks. Such
trunks shall connect the End Office PN utilizes to provide Telephone
Exchange Service and Switched Exchange Access to its Customers in
a given LATA to the access Tandem(s) Verizon utilizes to provide
Exchange Access in such LATA.
9.2.4 Access Toll Connecting Trunks shall be used solely for the
transmission and routing of Exchange Access to allow PN’s Customers
to connect to or be connected to the interexchange trunks of any
Interexchange Carrier which is connected to a Verizon access
Tandem.
10. Meet-Point Billing Arrangements
10.1 PN and Verizon will establish Meet-Point Billing (MPB) arrangements in order to
provide a common transport option to Switched Exchange Access Services
customers via a Verizon access Tandem Switch in accordance with the Meet
Point Billing guidelines contained in the OBF’s MECAB and MECOD documents,
except as modified herein, and in Verizon’s applicable Tariffs. The arrangements
described in this Section 10 are intended to be used to provide Switched
Exchange Access Service where the transport component of the Switched
Exchange Access Service is routed through an access Tandem Switch that is
provided by Verizon.
10.2 In each LATA, the Parties shall establish MPB arrangements for the applicable
PN Routing Point/Verizon Serving Interconnection Wire Center combinations.
10.3 Interconnection for the MPB arrangement shall occur at each of the Verizon
access Tandems in the LATA, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.
10.4 PN and Verizon will use reasonable efforts, individually and collectively, to
maintain provisions in their respective state access Tariffs, and/or provisions
within the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) Tariff No. 4, or any
successor Tariff sufficient to reflect the MPB arrangements established pursuant
to this Agreement.
10.5 In general, there are four alternative Meet-Point Billing arrangements possible,
which are: Single Bill/Single Tariff, Multiple Bill/Single Tariff, Multiple Bill/Multiple
Tariff, and Single Bill/Multiple Tariff, as outlined in the OBF MECAB Guidelines.
Each Party shall implement the “Multiple Bill/Single Tariff” or “Multiple Bill/Multiple
Tariff” option, as appropriate, in order to bill an IXC for the portion of the MPB
arrangement provided by that Party. Alternatively, in former Bell Atlantic service
areas, upon agreement of the Parties, each Party may use the New York State
Access Pool on its behalf to implement the Single Bill/Multiple Tariff or Single
Bill/Single Tariff option, as appropriate, in order to bill an IXC for the portion of
the MPB arrangement provided by that Party.
10.6 The rates to be billed by each Party for the portion of the MPB arrangement
provided by it shall be as set forth in that Party’s applicable Tariffs, or other
document that contains the terms under which that Party's access services are
offered. For each PN Routing Point/Verizon Serving Interconnection Wire Center
combination, the MPB billing percentages for transport between the PN Routing

Point and the Verizon Serving Interconnection Wire Center shall be calculated in
accordance with the formula set forth in Section 10.17 of this Attachment.
10.7 Each Party shall provide the other Party with the billing name, billing address,
and Carrier Identification Code (CIC) of the IXC, and identification of the Verizon
Interconnection Wire Center serving the IXC in order to comply with the MPB
notification process as outlined in the MECAB document.
10.8 Verizon shall provide PN with the Terminating Switched Access Detail Usage
Data (EMI category 1101XX records) recorded at the Verizon access Tandem on
cartridge or via such other media as the Parties may agree to, no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the date the usage occurred.
10.9 PN shall provide Verizon with the Originating Switched Access Detail Usage
Data (EMI category 1101XX records) on cartridge or via such other media as the
Parties may agree, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date the usage
occurred.
10.10 All usage data to be provided pursuant to Sections 10.8 and 10.9 of this
Attachment shall be sent to the following addresses:
To PN:
Scott Kell
27 N. Wacker St.
Suite 444
Chicago, Illinois 60606
For Verizon:
Verizon Data Services
ATTN: MPB
1 East Telecom Parkway
Dock D
Temple Terrace, FL 33637
Either Party may change its address for receiving usage data by notifying the
other Party in writing pursuant to Section 29 of the General Terms and
Conditions.
10.11 PN and Verizon shall coordinate and exchange the billing account reference
(BAR) and billing account cross reference (BACR) numbers or Operating
Company Number (“OCN”), as appropriate, for the MPB arrangements described
in this Section 10. Each Party shall notify the other if the level of billing or other
BAR/BACR elements change, resulting in a new BAR/BACR number, or if the
OCN changes.
10.12 Each Party agrees to provide the other Party with notification of any errors it
discovers in MPB data within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the
original data. The other Party shall attempt to correct the error and resubmit the
data within ten (10) Business Days of the notification. In the event the errors
cannot be corrected within such ten- (10) Business-Day period, the erroneous
data will be considered lost. In the event of a loss of data, whether due to
uncorrectable errors or otherwise, both Parties shall cooperate to reconstruct the
lost data and, if such reconstruction is not possible, shall accept a reasonable
estimate of the lost data based upon prior usage data.

10.13 Either Party may request a review or audit of the various components of access
recording up to a maximum of two (2) audits per calendar year. All costs
associated with each review and audit shall be borne by the requesting Party.
Such review or audit shall be conducted subject to Section 7 of the General
Terms and Conditions and during regular business hours. A Party may conduct
additional audits, at its expense, upon the other Party’s consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.14 Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section
10 shall create any liability for damages, losses, claims, costs, injuries, expenses
or other liabilities whatsoever on the part of either Party.
10.15 MPB will apply for all traffic bearing the 500, 900, toll free service access code
(e.g. 800/888/877) (to the extent provided by an IXC) or any other non-
geographic NPA which may be designated for such traffic in the future.
10.16 In the event PN determines to offer Telephone Exchange Services in a LATA in
which Verizon operates an access Tandem Switch, Verizon shall permit and
enable PN to subtend the Verizon access Tandem Switch(es) designated for the
Verizon End Offices in the area where there are located PN Routing Point(s)
associated with the NPA NXX(s) to/from which the Switched Exchange Access
Services are homed.
10.17 Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, the MPB billing percentages
for each Routing Point/Verizon Serving Interconnection Wire Center combination
shall be calculated according to the following formula, unless as mutually agreed
to by the Parties:
a / (a + b) = PN Billing Percentage
and
b / (a + b) = Verizon Billing Percentage
where:
a = the airline mileage between PN Routing Point and the actual
point of interconnection for the MPB arrangement; and
b = the airline mileage between the Verizon Serving Interconnection
Wire Center and the actual point of interconnection for the MPB arrangement.
10.18 PN shall inform Verizon of each LATA in which it intends to offer Telephone
Exchange Services and its calculation of the billing percentages which should
apply for such arrangement. Within ten (10) Business Days of PN’s delivery of
notice to Verizon, Verizon and PN shall confirm the Routing Point/Verizon
Serving Interconnection Wire Center combination and billing percentages.
11. Toll Free Service Access Code (e.g., 800/888/877) Traffic
The following terms shall apply when either Party delivers toll free service access code
(e.g., 800/877/888)("8YY") calls to the other Party. For the purposes of this Section 11,
the terms "translated" and "untranslated" refers to those toll free service access code
calls that have been queried ("translated") or have not been queried ("untranslated") to
an 8YY database. Except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all PN originating
"untranslated" 8YY traffic will be routed over a separate One-Way miscellaneous Trunk
group.

11.1 When PN delivers translated 8YY calls to Verizon to be completed by
11.1.1 an IXC:
11.1.1.1 PN will provide an appropriate EMI record to Verizon;
11.1.1.2 PN will bill the IXC the PN’s applicable Switched Exchange
Access Tariff charges and the PN's applicable Tariff query
charges; and
11.1.1.3 Verizon will bill the IXC Verizon’s applicable Switched
Exchange Access Tariff charges.
11.1.2 Verizon:
11.1.2.1 PN will provide an appropriate EMI record to Verizon; and
11.1.2.2 PN will bill Verizon the PN's Switched Exchange Access

the PN's applicable Switched Exchange Access Tariff
charges and the PN's applicable Tariff query charges; and
11.1.3.3 Verizon will bill the toll free service access code service
provider Verizon’s applicable Switched Exchange Access
Tariff charges.
11.2 When Verizon performs the query and delivers translated 8YY calls, originated
by Verizon's Customer or another LEC's Customer to PN to be completed by
11.2.1 PN:
11.2.1.1 Verizon will provide an appropriate EMI record to PN; and
11.2.1.2 Verizon will bill PN Verizon's applicable Switched Exchange
Access Tariff charges and Verizon’s applicable Tariff query
charges.
11.2.2 a toll free service access code service provider in that LATA:
11.2.2.1 Verizon will provide an appropriate EMI record to PN and
the toll free service access code service provider;
11.2.2.2 Verizon will bill the toll free service access code service
provider Verizon's applicable Switched Exchange Access
Tariff charges and Verizon's applicable Tariff query
charges; and
11.2.2.3 PN will bill the toll free service access code service provider
the PN’s applicable Switched Exchange Access Tariff
charges.

11.3 When PN: delivers untranslated 8YY calls to Verizon to be completed by
11.3.1 an IXC:
11.3.1.1 Verizon will query the call and route the call to the
appropriate IXC;
11.3.1.2 Verizon will provide an appropriate EMI record to PN;
11.3.1.3 Verizon will bill the IXC Verizon's applicable Switched
Exchange Access Tariff charges and Verizon's applicable
Tariff query charges; and
11.3.1.4 PN will bill the IXC PN’s applicable Switched Exchange
Access Tariff charges.

11.3.3.4 PN will bill the toll free service access code service provider
the PN’s applicable Switched Exchange Access Tariff
charges.
11.4 Verizon will not direct untranslated toll free service access code calls to PN.
12. Tandem Transit Traffic
12.1 As used in this Section, Tandem Transit Traffic is Telephone Exchange Service
traffic that originates on PN's network, and is transported through Verizon’s
Tandem to the subtending End Office or its equivalent of another carrier (CLEC,
ILEC other than Verizon, Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) carrier, or
other LEC (“Other Carrier”). Neither the originating nor terminating customer is a
Customer of Verizon. Subtending End Offices shall be determined in accordance
with and as identified in the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG). For the
avoidance of any doubt, under no circumstances shall Verizon be required to
transit traffic through a Verizon Tandem to a Central Office that the LERG does
not identify as subtending that particular Verizon Tandem. Switched Exchange
Access Service traffic is not Tandem Transit Traffic.

12.2 Tandem Transit Traffic Service provides PN with the transport of Tandem Transit
Traffic as provided below.
12.3 Tandem Transit Traffic may be routed over the Interconnection Trunks described
in Sections 2 through 6 of this Attachment. PN shall deliver each Tandem
Transit Traffic call to Verizon’s Tandem with CCS and the appropriate
Transactional Capabilities Application Part (“TCAP”) message to facilitate full
interoperability of CLASS Features and billing functions.
12.4 PN may use Tandem Transit Traffic Service only for traffic that originates on
PN’s network and only to send traffic to an Other Carrier with whom PN has a
reciprocal traffic exchange arrangement (either via written agreement or mutual
tariffs) that provides for the Other Carrier, to terminate or complete traffic
originated by PN and to bill PN, and not to bill Verizon, for such traffic. PN
agrees not to use Verizon’s Tandem Transit Traffic Service to send traffic to an
Other Carrier with whom PN does not have such a reciprocal traffic exchange
arrangement or to send traffic that does not originate on PN’s network.
12.5 PN shall pay Verizon for Tandem Transit Traffic Service at the rates specified in
the Pricing Attachment. Verizon will not be liable for compensation to any Other
Carrier for any traffic that is transported through Verizon’s Tandem and Verizon
reserves the right to assess to PN any additional charges or costs any Other
Carrier imposes or levies on Verizon for the delivery or termination of such traffic,
including any Switched Exchange Access Service charges. If Verizon is billed by
any Other Carrier for any traffic originated by PN, Verizon may provide notice to
PN of such billing. Upon receipt of such notice, PN shall immediately stop using
Verizon’s Tandem Transit Traffic Service to send any traffic to such Other Carrier
until it has provided to Verizon certification that the Other Carrier has removed
such billed charges from its bill to Verizon and that the Other Carrier will not bill
Verizon for any traffic originated by PN. Such certification must be signed by an
authorized officer or agent of the Other Carrier and must be in a form acceptable
to Verizon.
12.6 If PN uses Tandem Transit Traffic Service for traffic volumes that exceed the
Centum Call Seconds (Hundred Call Seconds) busy hour equivalent of 200,000
combined minutes of use per month (a DS1 equivalent) to the subtending End
Office of a particular Other Carrier for any month (the “Threshold Level”). PN
shall use good faith efforts to establish direct interconnection with such Other
Carrier and reduce such traffic volumes below the Threshold Level. If Verizon
believes that PN has not exercised good faith efforts promptly to obtain such
direct interconnection, either Party may use the Dispute Resolution processes of
this Agreement.
12.7 If PN fails to comply with Section 12 of this Attachment, such failure shall be a
material breach of a material provision of this Agreement and Verizon may
exercise any and all remedies under this Agreement and Applicable Law for such
breach.
12.8 If or when a third party carrier plans to subtend a PN switch, then PN shall
provide written notice to Verizon at least ninety (90) days before such subtending
service arrangement becomes effective so that Verizon may negotiate and
establish direct interconnection with such third party carrier. Upon written
request from Verizon, PN shall offer to Verizon a service arrangement equivalent
to or the same as Tandem Transit Traffic Service provided by Verizon to PN as
defined in this Section such that Verizon may terminate calls to a Central Office
or its equivalent of a CLEC, ILEC other than Verizon, CMRS carrier, or other
LEC, that subtends a PN Central Office or its equivalent (“Reciprocal Tandem

Transit Service”). PN shall offer such Reciprocal Transit Service arrangements
under terms and conditions of an amendment to this Agreement or a separate
agreement no less favorable than those provided in this Section.
12.9 Neither Party shall take any actions to prevent the other Party from entering into
a direct and reciprocal traffic exchange arrangement with any carrier to which it
originates, or from which it terminates, traffic.
13. Number Resources, Rate Center Areas and Routing Points
13.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or otherwise adversely
affect in any manner either Party’s right to employ or to request and be assigned
any Central Office Codes (“NXX”) pursuant to the Central Office Code
Assignment Guidelines and any relevant FCC or Commission orders, as may be
amended from time to time, or to establish, by Tariff or otherwise, Rate Center
Areas and Routing Points corresponding to such NXX codes.
13.2 It shall be the responsibility of each Party to program and update its own
switches and network systems pursuant to information provided on ASRs as well
as the LERG in order to recognize and route traffic to the other Party’s assigned
NXX codes. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Party shall
impose any fees or charges whatsoever on the other Party for such activities.
13.3 Unless otherwise required by Commission order, the Rate Center Areas will be
the same for each Party. During the term of this Agreement, PN shall adopt the
Rate Center Area and Rate Center Points that the Commission has approved for
Verizon within the LATA and Tandem serving area. PN shall assign whole NPA-
NXX codes to each Rate Center Area unless otherwise ordered by the FCC, the
Commission or another governmental entity of appropriate jurisdiction, or the
LEC industry adopts alternative methods of utilizing NXXs.
13.4 PN will also designate a Routing Point for each assigned NXX code. PN shall
designate one location for each Rate Center Area in which the PN has
established NXX code(s) as the Routing Point for the NPA-NXXs associated with
that Rate Center Area, and such Routing Point shall be within the same LATA as
the Rate Center Area but not necessarily within the Rate Center Area itself.
Unless specified otherwise, calls to subsequent NXXs of PN will be routed in the
same manner as calls to PN’s initial NXXs.
13.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement is intended, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed, to in
any way constrain PN’s choices regarding the size of the local calling area(s) that
PN may establish for its Customers, which local calling areas may be larger than,
smaller than, or identical to Verizon’s local calling areas.
14. Joint Network Implementation and Grooming Process; Forecasting
14.1 Joint Network Implementation and Grooming Process.
Upon request of either Party, the Parties shall jointly develop an implementation
and grooming process (the “Joint Grooming Process” or “Joint Process”) which
may define and detail, inter alia:
14.1.1 standards to ensure that Interconnection Trunks experience a grade of
service, availability and quality which is comparable to that achieved
on interoffice trunks within Verizon’s network and in accord with all
appropriate relevant industry-accepted quality, reliability and

availability standards. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement,
trunks provided by either Party for Interconnection services will be
engineered using a design-blocking objective of B.01.
14.1.2 the respective duties and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to
the administration and maintenance of the trunk groups, including, but
not limited to, standards and procedures for notification and
discoveries of trunk disconnects;
14.1.3 disaster recovery provision escalations;
14.1.4 additional technically feasible Point(s) of Interconnection on Verizon’s
network in a LATA as provided in Section 2 of this Attachment; and
14.1.5 such other matters as the Parties may agree, including, e.g., End
Office to End Office high usage trunks as good engineering practices
may dictate.
14.2 Trunk Forecasting Requirements.
14.2.1 Initial Trunk Forecast Requirements. At least ninety (90) days before
initiating interconnection in a LATA, PN shall provide Verizon a two (2)-
year traffic forecast that complies with the Verizon Interconnection
Trunking Forecast Guide, as revised from time to time. This initial
traffic forecast will provide the amount of traffic to be delivered to and
from Verizon over each of the Interconnection Trunk groups in the
LATA over the next eight (8) quarters.
14.2.2 Ongoing Trunk Forecast Requirements. Where the Parties have
already established interconnection in a LATA, PN shall provide a new
or revised traffic forecast that complies with the Verizon
Interconnection Trunking Forecast Guide when PN develops plans or
becomes aware of information that will materially affect the Parties’
interconnection in that LATA. Instances that require a new or revised
forecast include, but are not limited to: (a) PN plans to deploy a new
switch; (b) PN plans to implement a new POI or network architecture;
(c) PN plans to rearrange its network; (d) PN plans to convert a One-
Way Interconnection Trunk group to a Two-Way Interconnection Trunk
group; (e) PN plans to convert a Two-Way Interconnection Trunk group
to a One-Way Interconnection Trunk group; or (f) PN expects a
significant change in interconnection traffic volume. In addition, upon
request by either Party, the Parties shall meet to: (i) review traffic and
usage data on End Office and Tandem Interconnection Trunk groups
and (ii) determine whether the Parties should establish new
Interconnection Trunk groups, augment existing Interconnection Trunk
groups, or disconnect existing Interconnection Trunks.
14.2.3 Use of Trunk Forecasts. Trunk forecasts provided pursuant to this
Agreement must be prepared in good faith but are not otherwise
binding on PN or Verizon.
15. Number Portability - Section 251(B)(2)
15.1 Scope.
The Parties shall provide Number Portability (NP) in accordance with rules and
regulations as from time to time prescribed by the FCC.

15.2 Procedures for Providing LNP (“Local Number Portability”).
The Parties will follow the LNP provisioning process recommended by the North
American Numbering Council (NANC) and the Industry Numbering Council (INC),
and adopted by the FCC. In addition, the Parties agree to follow the LNP
ordering procedures established at the OBF. The Parties shall provide LNP on a
reciprocal basis.
15.2.1 A Customer of one Party ("Party A") elects to become a Customer of
the other Party ("Party B"). The Customer elects to utilize the original
telephone number(s) corresponding to the Telephone Exchange
Service(s) it previously received from Party A, in conjunction with the
Telephone Exchange Service(s) it will now receive from Party B. After
Party B has received authorization from the Customer in accordance
with Applicable Law and sends an LSR to Party A, Parties A and B will
work together to port the Customer’s telephone number(s) from Party
A’s network to Party B’s network.
15.2.2 When a telephone number is ported out of Party A’s network, Party A
will remove any non-proprietary line based calling card(s) associated
with the ported number(s) from its Line Information Database (LIDB).
Reactivation of the line-based calling card in another LIDB, if desired,
is the responsibility of Party B or Party B’s Customer.
15.2.3 When a Customer of Party A ports their telephone numbers to Party B
and the Customer has previously secured a reservation of line
numbers from Party A for possible activation at a future point, these
reserved but inactive numbers may be ported along with the active
numbers to be ported provided the numbers have been reserved for
the Customer. Party B may request that Party A port all reserved
numbers assigned to the Customer or that Party A port only those
numbers listed by Party B. As long as Party B maintains reserved but
inactive numbers ported for the Customer, Party A shall not reassign
those numbers. Party B shall not reassign the reserved numbers to
another Customer.
15.2.4 When a Customer of Party A ports their telephone numbers to Party B,
in the process of porting the Customer’s telephone numbers, Party A
shall implement the ten-digit trigger feature where it is available. When
Party A receives the porting request, the unconditional trigger shall be
applied to the Customer’s line before the due date of the porting
activity. When the ten-digit unconditional trigger is not available, Party
A and Party B must coordinate the disconnect activity.
15.2.5 The Parties shall furnish each other with the Jurisdiction Information
Parameter (JIP) in the Initial Address Message (IAM), according to
industry standards.
15.2.6 Where LNP is commercially available, the NXXs in the office shall be
defined as portable, except as noted in 15.2.7, and translations will be
changed in the Parties’ switches to open those NXXs for database
queries in all applicable LNP capable offices within the LATA of the
given switch(es). On a prospective basis, all newly deployed switches
will be equipped with LNP capability and so noted in the LERG.
15.2.7 All NXXs assigned to LNP capable switches are to be designated as
portable unless a NXX(s) has otherwise been designated as non-

portable. Non-portable NXXs include NXX codes assigned to paging
services; NXX codes assigned for internal testing and official use, and
any other NXX codes required to be designated as non-portable by the
rules and regulations of the FCC. NXX codes assigned to mass calling
on a choked network may not be ported using LNP technology but are
portable using methods established by the NANC and adopted by the
FCC. On a prospective basis, newly assigned codes in switches
capable of porting shall become commercially available for porting with
the effective date in the network.
15.2.8 Both Parties’ use of LNP shall meet the performance criteria specified
by the FCC. Both Parties will act as the default carrier for the other
Party in the event that either Party is unable to perform the routing
necessary for LNP.
15.3 Procedures for Providing NP Through Full NXX Code Migration.
Where a Party has activated an entire NXX for a single Customer, or activated at
least eighty percent (80%) of an NXX for a single Customer, with the remaining
numbers in that NXX either reserved for future use by that Customer or otherwise
unused, if such Customer chooses to receive Telephone Exchange Service from
the other Party, the first Party shall cooperate with the second Party to have the
entire NXX reassigned in the LERG (and associated industry databases, routing
tables, etc.) to an End Office operated by the second Party. Such transfer will be
accomplished with appropriate coordination between the Parties and subject to
appropriate industry lead times for movements of NXXs from one switch to
another. Neither Party shall charge the other in connection with this coordinated
transfer.
15.4 Procedures for LNP Request.
The Parties shall provide for the requesting of End Office LNP capability on a
reciprocal basis through a written request. The Parties acknowledge that Verizon
has deployed LNP throughout its network in compliance with FCC 96-286 and
other applicable FCC Regulations.
15.4.1 If Party B desires to have LNP capability deployed in an End Office of
Party A, which is not currently capable, Party B shall issue a LNP
request to Party A. Party A will respond to the Party B, within ten (10)
days of receipt of the request, with a date for which LNP will be
available in the requested End Office. Party A shall proceed to provide
for LNP in compliance with the procedures and timelines set forth in
FCC 96-286, Paragraph 80, and FCC 97-74, Paragraphs 65 through
67.
15.4.2 The Parties acknowledge that each can determine the LNP-capable
End Offices of the other through the Local Exchange Routing Guide
(LERG). In addition, the Parties shall make information available upon
request showing their respective LNP-capable End Offices, as set forth
in this Section 15.4.
15.5 PN shall submit orders to port numbers electronically using an LSR via the
Verizon web Graphical User Interface ("GUI") or Electronic Data Interface ("EDI")
pursuant to the instructions, business rules and guidelines set forth on the
Verizon Partner Solutions website (formerly referred to as the Verizon wholesale
website).

16. Good Faith Performance
If and, to the extent that, Verizon, prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, has not
provided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a Service offered under this Attachment,
Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with PN reasonable terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes) for such
Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either Party may utilize the Agreement’s
dispute resolution procedures.

consent of PN.
3.3 To the extent required by Applicable Law, the Verizon Telecommunications
Services to be provided to PN for resale pursuant to this Attachment will include
a Verizon Telecommunications Service customer-specific contract service
arrangement (“CSA”) (such as a customer specific pricing arrangement or
individual case based pricing arrangement) that Verizon is providing to a Verizon
Customer at the time the CSA is requested by PN.
4. Responsibility for Charges
4.1 PN shall be responsible for and pay to Verizon all charges for any
Telecommunications Services provided by Verizon or provided by persons other
than Verizon and billed for by Verizon, that are ordered, activated or used by PN,
PN Customers or any other persons, through, by means of, or in association
with, Telecommunications Services provided by Verizon to PN pursuant to this
Resale Attachment.
4.2 Upon request by PN, Verizon will provide for use on resold Verizon retail
Telecommunications Service dial tone lines purchased by PN such Verizon retail
Telecommunications Service call blocking and call screening services as Verizon
provides to its own end user retail Customers, where and to the extent Verizon
provides such Verizon retail Telecommunications Service call blocking services
to Verizon’s own end user retail Customers. PN understands and agrees that
certain of Verizon’s call blocking and call screening services are not guaranteed
to block or screen all calls and that notwithstanding PN’s purchase of such
blocking or screening services, PN’s end user Customers or other persons
ordering, activating or using Telecommunications Services on the resold dial tone

lines may complete or accept calls which PN intended to block. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, PN shall be responsible for and shall pay Verizon all charges for
Telecommunications Services provided by Verizon or provided by persons other
than Verizon and billed for by Verizon in accordance with the terms of Section
4.1 above.
5. Operations Matters

Verizon Telecommunications Services to PN, Verizon shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to identify the Verizon
Telecommunications Services with Verizon’s trade names, trademarks
and service marks (“Verizon Marks”), to the same extent that these
Services are identified with Verizon’s Marks when they are provided to
Verizon’s Customers. Any such identification of Verizon’s
Telecommunications Services shall not constitute the grant of a license
or other right to PN to use Verizon’s Marks.
5.2.2 To the extent required by Applicable Law, upon request by PN and at
prices, terms and conditions to be negotiated by PN and Verizon,
Verizon shall provide Verizon Telecommunications Services for resale
that are identified by PN’s trade name, or that are not identified by
trade name, trademark or service mark.
5.2.3 If Verizon uses a third-party contractor to provide Verizon operator
services or Verizon directory assistance, PN will be responsible for
entering into a direct contractual arrangement with the third-party
contractor at PN’s expense (a) to obtain identification of Verizon

Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with PN reasonable terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes) for such
Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either Party may utilize the Agreement’s
dispute resolution procedures.

NETWORK ELEMENTS ATTACHMENT
1. General
1.1 Verizon shall provide to PN, in accordance with this Agreement (including, but
not limited to, Verizon’s applicable Tariffs) and the requirements of the Federal
Unbundling Rules, access to Verizon’s Network Elements on an unbundled basis
and in combinations (Combinations), and UNEs commingled with wholesale
services ("Commingling"); provided, however, that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Verizon shall be obligated to provide access to
unbundled Network Elements (UNEs), Combinations, and Commingling to PN
under the terms of this Agreement only to the extent required by the Federal
Unbundling Rules and may decline to provide access to UNEs, Combinations, or
Commingling to PN to the extent that provision of such UNEs, Combinations, or
Commingling is not required by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
1.2 Verizon shall be obligated to combine UNEs that are not already combined in
Verizon’s network only to the extent required by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
Except as otherwise required by this Agreement and the Federal Unbundling
Rules: (a) Verizon shall be obligated to provide a UNE or Combination pursuant
to this Agreement only to the extent such UNE or Combination, and the
equipment and facilities necessary to provide such UNE or Combination, are
already available in Verizon’s network; and (b) Verizon shall have no obligation to
construct, modify, or deploy facilities or equipment to offer any UNE or
Combination.
1.3 PN may use a UNE or Combination only for those purposes for which Verizon is
required by the Federal Unbundling Rules to provide such UNE or Combination
to PN. Without limiting the foregoing, PN may not access a UNE or Combination
for the exclusive provision of Mobile Wireless Services or Interexchange
Services. For purposes of this section, "Interexchange Services" shall have the
meaning set forth in the Triennial Review Remand Order and subsequent
applicable FCC orders.
1.3.1 Verizon shall not be obligated to provide to PN, and PN shall not
request from Verizon, access to a proprietary advanced intelligent
network service.
1.4 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an agreement
by Verizon that any item identified in this Agreement as a Network Element is (i)
a Network Element under the Federal Unbundling Rules, or (ii) a Network
Element Verizon is required by the Federal Unbundling Rules to provide to PN on
an unbundled basis or in combination with other Network Elements.
1.5 If as the result of PN Customer actions (e.g., Customer Not Ready (“CNR”)),
Verizon cannot complete requested work activity when a technician has been
dispatched to the PN Customer premises, PN will be assessed a non-recurring
charge associated with this visit. This charge will be the sum of the applicable
Service Order charge as provided in the Pricing Attachment and the Customer
Not Ready Charge provided for in the Pricing Attachment (or, in the absence of a
Customer Not Ready Charge, the Premises Visit Charge as provided in Verizon’s
applicable retail or wholesale Tariff or in the Pricing Attachment).

1.6 Absence or Cessation of Unbundling Obligation and Related Provisions. The
following provisions shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or any Verizon Tariff or SGAT:
1.6.1 Discontinued Facilities.
1.6.1.1 Verizon may cease offering or providing PN with access on
an unbundled basis at rates prescribed under Section 251
of the Act to any facility that is or becomes a Discontinued
Facility, whether as a stand-alone UNE, as part of a
Combination, or otherwise. To the extent Verizon has not
already ceased offering or providing unbundled access to a
particular Discontinued Facility that is a Discontinued
Facility as of the Effective Date, Verizon may cease offering
or providing unbundled access to such Discontinued Facility
immediately upon the Effective Date without further notice
to PN. Subject to Section 1.7 below, if a facility on or at any
time after the Effective Date is or becomes a Discontinued
Facility, Verizon, to the extent it has not already ceased
providing unbundled access to such Discontinued Facility,
and provided it has given at least ninety (90) days written
notice of discontinuance in cases where it has not already
ceased providing such access, will continue to provide
unbundled access to such Discontinued Facility under the
Agreement only through the effective date of the notice of
discontinuance, and not beyond that date.
1.6.1.2 Where Verizon is permitted to cease providing a
Discontinued Facility pursuant to Section 1.6.1 above and
PN has not submitted an LSR or ASR, as appropriate, to
Verizon requesting disconnection of the Discontinued
Facility and has not separately secured from Verizon an
alternative arrangement to replace the Discontinued Facility,
then Verizon, to the extent it has not already done so, may
disconnect the subject Discontinued Facility without further
notice to PN. In lieu of disconnecting the subject
Discontinued Facility in the foregoing circumstances,
Verizon, in its sole discretion, may elect to: (a) convert the
subject Discontinued Facility to an arrangement available
under a Verizon access tariff (in which case month-to-month
rates shall apply unless a different rate applies under an
applicable special access term/volume plan or other special
access tariff arrangement in which PN is then enrolled), a
resale arrangement, or other analogous arrangement that
Verizon shall identify or has identified in writing to PN, or (b)
in lieu of such a conversion, reprice the subject
Discontinued Facility by application of a new rate (or, in
Verizon's sole discretion, by application of a surcharge to an
existing rate) to be equivalent to an arrangement available
under a Verizon access tariff (at month-to-month rates
unless a different rate applies under an applicable special
access term/volume plan or other special access tariff
arrangement in which PN is then enrolled), a resale
arrangement, or other analogous arrangement that Verizon
shall identify or has identified in writing to PN; provided,
however, that Verizon may disconnect the subject

Discontinued Facility (or the replacement service to which
the Discontinued Facility has been converted) if PN fails to
pay when due any applicable new rate or surcharge billed
by Verizon.
1.7 TRRO Certification and Related Provisions.
1.7.1 TRRO Certification. Before requesting unbundled access to a DS1
Loop, a DS3 Loop, DS1 Dedicated Transport, DS3 Dedicated
Transport, or Dark Fiber Transport, including, but not limited to, any of
the foregoing elements that constitute part of a Combination or that PN
seeks to convert from another wholesale service to an unbundled
network element (collectively, "TRRO Certification Elements"), PN
must undertake a reasonably diligent inquiry and, based on that
inquiry, certify that, to the best of its knowledge, PN's request is
consistent with the requirements of the TRRO and that PN is entitled to
unbundled access to the subject element pursuant to section 251(c)(3)
of the Act. PN shall provide such certification using the automated
method that Verizon makes available for that purpose. PN's
reasonably diligent inquiry must include, at a minimum, consideration
of any list of non-impaired UNE Wire Centers that Verizon makes or
has made available to PN by notice and/or by publication on Verizon's
wholesale website (the "Wire Center List") and any back-up data that
Verizon provides or has provided to PN under a non-disclosure
agreement or that is otherwise available to PN.
1.7.2 Provision-then-Dispute Requirements.
1.7.2.1 Upon receiving a request from PN for unbundled access to
a TRRO Certification Element and the certification required
by Section 1.7.1 above, and except as provided in Section
1.7.2.3 below, Verizon shall process the request in
accordance with any applicable standard intervals. If
Verizon wishes to challenge PN's right to obtain unbundled
access to the subject element pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §
251(c)(3), then (except as provided in Section 1.7.2.3
below) Verizon must provision the subject element as a
UNE and then seek resolution of the dispute by the
Commission or the FCC, or through such other dispute
resolution process that Verizon elects to invoke under the
dispute resolution provisions of this Agreement.
1.7.2.2 If a dispute pursuant to section 1.7.2.1 above is resolved in
Verizon’s favor, then PN shall compensate Verizon for the
additional charges that would apply if PN had ordered the
subject facility or service on a month-to-month term under
Verizon's interstate special access tariff (except as provided
in section 1.7.2.2.1 below as to Dark Fiber Transport) and
any other applicable charges, applicable back to the date of
provisioning (including, but not limited to, late payment
charges for the unpaid difference between UNE and access
tariff rates). The month-to-month rates shall apply until
such time as PN requests disconnection of the subject
facility or an alternative term that Verizon offers under its
interstate special access tariff for the subject facility or
service.

1.7.2.2.1 In the case of Dark Fiber Transport (there being
no analogous service under Verizon's access
tariffs), the monthly recurring charges that
Verizon may charge, and that PN shall be
obligated to pay, for each circuit shall be shall be
the charges for the commercial service that
Verizon, in its sole discretion, determines to be
analogous to the subject Dark Fiber Transport
and, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties, Verizon may, without further notice,
disconnect the subject dark fiber facility within
thirty (30) days of the date on which the dispute
is resolved in Verizon's favor. In any case
where PN, within thirty (30) days of the date on
which the dispute is resolved in Verizon's favor,
submits a valid ASR for a "lit" service to replace
the subject Dark Fiber Transport facility, Verizon
shall continue to provide the Dark Fiber
Transport facility at the rates specified above,
but only for the duration of the standard interval
for installation of the "lit" service.
1.7.2.3 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement,
Verizon may reject a PN order for a TRRO Certification
Element without first seeking dispute resolution: (a) in any
case where PN's order conflicts with a provision of a
Verizon Tariff, (b) in any case where PN's order conflicts
with a non-impaired UNE Wire Center designation set forth
in a Wire Center List that Verizon has made available to PN
by notice and/or by publication on Verizon's wholesale
website, (c) in any case where PN's order conflicts with a
non-impaired UNE Wire Center designation that the
Commission or the FCC has ordered or approved or that
has otherwise been confirmed through previous dispute
resolution (regardless of whether PN was a party to such
dispute resolution), or (d) as otherwise permitted under the
Federal Unbundling Rules (including, but not limited to,
upon a determination by the Commission, the FCC, or a
court of competent jurisdiction that Verizon may reject
orders for TRRO Certification Elements without first seeking
dispute resolution).
1.8 Limitation With Respect to Replacement Arrangements. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any negotiations regarding any UNE-
replacement arrangement, facility, service or the like that Verizon is not required
to provide under the Federal Unbundling Rules (including without limitation any
arrangement, facility, service or the like that Verizon offers under an access tariff)
shall be deemed not to have been conducted pursuant to the Agreement, 47
U.S.C. § 252(a)(1), or 47 C.F.R. Part 51, and shall not be subject to arbitration or
other requirements under to 47 U.S.C. § 252(b). Any reference in this
Attachment to Verizon's provision of a arrangement, facility, service or the like
that Verizon is not required to provide under the Federal Unbundling Rules is
solely for the convenience of the Parties and shall not be construed to require or
permit: (a) arbitration pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 252(b) of the rates, terms, or
conditions upon which Verizon may provide such arrangement, facility, service or
the like, or (b) application of 47 U.S.C. § 252 in any other respect.

2. Verizon’s Provision of Network Elements
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment, in accordance with, but
only to the extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules, Verizon shall provide PN
access to the following:
2.1 Loops, as set forth in Section 3 of this Attachment;
2.2 Line Splitting (also referred to as “Loop Sharing”), as set forth in Section 4 of this
Attachment;
2.3 [Intentionally Left Blank];

Facilities”) (or “IOF”), as set forth in Section 11 of this Attachment;
2.10 [Intentionally Left Blank];
2.11 Operations Support Systems, as set forth in Section 13 of this Attachment; and
2.12 Other UNEs in accordance with Section 14 of this Attachment.
3. Loop Transmission Types
3.1 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment, Verizon shall
allow PN to access Loops unbundled from local switching and local transport, in
accordance with this Section 3 and the rates and charges provided in the Pricing
Attachment. Verizon shall allow PN access to Loops in accordance with, but only
to extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules. Subject to the foregoing
and the provisions regarding FTTP Loops, in Section 3.5 below, and Hybrid
Loops, in Section 3.6 below, the available Loop types are as set forth below:
3.1.1 “2 Wire Analog Voice Grade Loop” or “Analog 2W” provides an
effective 2-wire channel with 2-wire interfaces at each end that is
suitable for the transport of analog Voice Grade (nominal 300 to 3000
Hz) signals and loop-start signaling. This Loop type is more fully
described in Verizon Technical Reference (TR)-72565, as revised from
time-to-time. If “Customer-Specified Signaling” is requested, the Loop
will operate with one of the following signaling types that may be
specified when the Loop is ordered: loop-start, ground-start, loop-
reverse-battery, and no signaling. Customer specified signaling is
more fully described in Verizon TR-72570, as revised from time-to-
time. Verizon will not build new facilities or modify existing facilities
except to the extent required in Section 17 of this Attachment.

3.1.2 “4-Wire Analog Voice Grade Loop” or “Analog 4W” provides an
effective 4-wire channel with 4-wire interfaces at each end that is
suitable for the transport of analog Voice Grade (nominal 300 to 3000
Hz) signals. This Loop type will operate with one of the following
signaling types that may be specified when the Loop is ordered: loop-
start, ground-start, loop-reverse-battery, duplex, and no signaling. This
Loop type is more fully described in Verizon TR-72570, as revised from
time-to-time. Verizon will not build new facilities or modify existing
facilities except to the extent required in Section 17 of this Attachment.
3.1.3 “2-Wire ISDN Digital Grade Loop” or “BRI ISDN” provides a channel
with 2-wire interfaces at each end that is suitable for the transport of
160 kbps digital services using the ISDN 2B1Q line code. This Loop
type is more fully described in American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) T1.601-1998 and Verizon TR 72575, as revised from time-to-
time. In some cases loop extension equipment may be necessary to
bring the line loss within acceptable levels. Verizon will provide loop
extension equipment only upon request. A separate charge will apply
for loop extension equipment. The 2-Wire ISDN Digital Grade Loop is
available only in the former Bell Atlantic Service Areas. In the former
GTE Service Areas only, PN may order a 2-Wire Digital Compatible
Loop using 2-wire ISDN ordering codes to provide similar capability.
Verizon will not build new facilities or modify existing facilities except to
the extent required in Section 17 of this Attachment.
3.1.4 “2-Wire ADSL-Compatible Loop” or “ADSL 2W” provides a channel
with 2-wire interfaces at each end that is suitable for the transport of
digital signals up to 8 Mbps toward the Customer and up to 1 Mbps
from the Customer. This Loop type is more fully described in Verizon

3.1.14.4 a 2W Digital Loop with Verizon-placed ISDN loop extension
electronics (such a Loop with ISDN loop extension
electronics so placed shall be deemed to be a “2W Digital
Compatible Loop”).
3.1.15 Verizon shall make Conditioned Loops available to PN at the rates as
set forth in the Pricing Attachment.
3.2 The following ordering procedures shall apply to xDSL Compatible Loops, Digital
Designed and Conditioned Loops:

3.2.1 PN shall place orders for xDSL Compatible Loops, Digital Designed
and Conditioned Loops by delivering to Verizon a valid electronic
transmittal Service Order or other mutually agreed upon type of
Service Order. Such Service Order shall be provided in accordance
with industry format and specifications or such format and
specifications as may be agreed to by the Parties.
3.2.2 In former Bell Atlantic Service Areas, Verizon is conducting a
mechanized survey of existing Loop facilities, on a Central Office by
Central Office basis, to identify those Loops that meet the applicable
technical characteristics established by Verizon for compatibility with
xDSL Compatible or BRI ISDN signals. The results of this survey will
be stored in a mechanized database and made available to PN as the
process is completed in each Central Office. PN must utilize this
mechanized loop qualification database, where available, in advance
of submitting a valid electronic transmittal Service Order for an xDSL
Compatible or BRI ISDN Loop. Charges for mechanized loop
qualification information are set forth in the Pricing Attachment. In
former GTE Service Areas, Verizon provides access to mechanized
xDSL loop qualification information to help identify those loops that
meet applicable technical characteristics for compatibility with xDSL
Services that the CLEC may wish to offer to its end user Customers.
PN must access Verizon's mechanized loop qualification system
through the use of the on-line computer interface at
www.verizon.com/wise in advance of submitting a valid electronic
transmittal Service Order for xDSL service arrangements. The loop
qualification information provided by Verizon gives PN the ability to
determine loop composition and loop length, and may provide other
loop characteristics, when present, that may indicate incompatibility
with xDSL Services such as load coils or Digital Loop Carrier.
Information provided by the mechanized loop qualification system also
indicates whether loop conditioning may be necessary. It is the
responsibility of PN to evaluate the loop qualification information
provided by Verizon and determine whether a loop meets PN
requirements for xDSL Service, including determining whether
conditioning should be ordered, prior to submitting an Order.
3.2.3 If the Loop is not listed in the mechanized database described in
Section3.2.2 of this Attachment, PN must request a manual loop
qualification, where such qualification is available, prior to submitting a
valid electronic Service Order for an xDSL Compatible or BRI ISDN
Loop. In general, Verizon will complete a manual loop qualification
request within three (3) Business Days, although Verizon may require
additional time due to poor record conditions, spikes in demand, or
other unforeseen events. The manual loop qualification process is
currently available in the former Bell Atlantic Service Areas only.
3.2.4 If a query to the mechanized loop qualification database or manual
loop qualification indicates that a Loop does not qualify (e.g., because
it does not meet the applicable technical parameters set forth in the
Loop descriptions above), PN may request an Engineering Query,
where available, as described in Section 3.2.7 of this Attachment, to
determine whether the result is due to characteristics of the loop itself
(e.g., specific number and location of bridged taps, the specific number
of load coils, or the gauge of the cable).

3.2.5 Once a Loop has been pre-qualified, PN will submit a Service Order
pursuant to Section 3.2.1 of this Attachment if it wishes to obtain the
Loop.
3.2.5.1 If the Loop is determined to be xDSL Compatible and if the
Loop serving the serving address is usable and available to
be assigned as a xDSL Compatible Loop, Verizon will
initiate standard Loop provisioning and installation
processes, and standard Loop provisioning intervals will
apply.
3.2.5.2 If the Loop is determined to be xDSL Compatible, but the
Loop serving the service address is unusable or unavailable
to be assigned as an xDSL Compatible Loop, Verizon will
search the Customer’s serving terminal for a suitable spare
facility. If an xDSL Compatible Loop is found within the
serving terminal, Verizon will perform a Line and Station
Transfer (or “pair swap”) whereby the Verizon technician will
transfer the Customer’s existing service from one existing
Loop facility onto an alternate existing xDSL Compatible
Loop facility serving the same location. Verizon performs
Line and Station Transfers in accordance with the
procedures developed in the DSL Collaborative in the State
of New York, NY PSC Case 00-C-0127. Standard intervals
do not apply when Verizon performs a Line and Station
Transfer, and additional charges shall apply as set forth in
the Pricing Attachment.
3.2.6 If PN submits a Service Order for an xDSL Compatible or BRI ISDN
Loop that has not been prequalified, Verizon will query the Service
Order back to PN for qualification and will not accept such Service
Order until the Loop has been prequalified on a mechanized or manual
basis. If PN submits a Service Order for an xDSL Compatible or BRI
ISDN Loop that is, in fact, not compatible with the requested service
(e.g. ADSL, HDSL etc.) in its existing condition, Verizon will respond
back to PN with a “Nonqualified” indicator and with information
showing whether the non-qualified result is due to the presence of load
coils, presence of digital loop carrier, or loop length (including bridged
tap).
3.2.7 Where PN has followed the prequalification procedure described
above and has determined that a Loop is not compatible with xDSL
technologies or BRI ISDN service in its existing condition, it may either
request an Engineering Query, where available, to determine whether
conditioning may make the Loop compatible with the applicable
service; or if PN is already aware of the conditioning required (e.g.,
where PN has previously requested a qualification and has obtained
loop characteristics), PN may submit a Service Order for a Digital
Designed Loop. Verizon will undertake to condition or extend the Loop
in accordance with this Section 3.2 of this Attachment upon receipt of
PN’s valid, accurate and pre-qualified Service Order for a Digital
Designed Loop.
3.2.8 The Parties will make reasonable efforts to coordinate their respective
roles in order to minimize provisioning problems. In general, where
conditioning or loop extensions are requested by PN, an interval of
eighteen (18) Business Days will be required by Verizon to complete

the loop analysis and the necessary construction work involved in
conditioning and/or extending the loop as follows:
3.2.8.1 Three (3) Business Days will be required following receipt of
PN’s valid, accurate and pre-qualified Service Order for a
Digital Designed or Conditioned Loop to analyze the loop
and related plant records and to create an Engineering
Work Order.
3.2.8.2 Upon completion of an Engineering Work Order, Verizon
will initiate the construction order to perform the
changes/modifications to the Loop requested by PN.
Conditioning activities are, in most cases, able to be
accomplished within fifteen (15) Business Days.
Unforeseen conditions may add to this interval.
After the engineering and conditioning tasks have been completed, the
standard Loop provisioning and installation process will be initiated,
subject to Verizon’s standard provisioning intervals.
3.2.9 If PN requires a change in scheduling, it must contact Verizon to issue
a supplement to the original Service Order. If PN cancels the request
for conditioning after a loop analysis has been completed but prior to
the commencement of construction work, PN shall compensate
Verizon for an Engineering Work Order charge as set forth in the
Pricing Attachment. If PN cancels the request for conditioning after the
loop analysis has been completed and after construction work has
started or is complete, PN shall compensate Verizon for an
Engineering Work Order charge as well as the charges associated with
the conditioning tasks performed as set forth in the Pricing Attachment.
3.3 Conversion of Live Telephone Exchange Service to Analog 2W Loops.
3.3.1 The following coordination procedures shall apply to “live” cutovers of
Verizon Customers who are converting their Telephone Exchange
Services to PN Telephone Exchange Services provisioned over Analog
2W unbundled Local Loops (“Analog 2W Loops) to be provided by
Verizon to PN:
3.3.1.1 Coordinated cutover charges shall apply to conversions of
live Telephone Exchange Services to Analog 2W Loops.
When an outside dispatch is required to perform a
conversion, additional charges may apply. If PN does not
request a coordinated cutover, Verizon will process PN’s
order as a new installation subject to applicable standard
provisioning intervals.
3.3.1.2 PN shall request Analog 2W Loops for coordinated cutover
from Verizon by delivering to Verizon a valid electronic
Local Service Request (“LSR”). Verizon agrees to accept
from PN the date and time for the conversion designated on
the LSR (“Scheduled Conversion Time”), provided that such
designation is within the regularly scheduled operating
hours of the Verizon Regional CLEC Control Center
(“RCCC”) and subject to the availability of Verizon’s work
force. In the event that Verizon’s work force is not
available, PN and Verizon shall mutually agree on a New

Conversion Time, as defined below. PN shall designate the
Scheduled Conversion Time subject to Verizon standard
provisioning intervals as stated in the Verizon CLEC
Handbook, as may be revised from time to time. Within
three (3) Business Days of Verizon's receipt of such valid
LSR, or as otherwise required by the Federal Unbundling
Rules, Verizon shall provide PN the scheduled due date for
conversion of the Analog 2W Loops covered by such LSR.
3.3.1.3 PN shall provide dial tone at the PN collocation site at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Scheduled Conversion
Time.
3.3.1.4 Either Party may contact the other Party to negotiate a new
Scheduled Conversion Time (the “New Conversion Time”);
provided, however, that each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide four (4) business hours’
advance notice to the other Party of its request for a New
Conversion Time. Any Scheduled Conversion Time or New
Conversion Time may not be rescheduled more than one
(1) time in a Business Day, and any two New Conversion
Times for a particular Analog 2W Loop shall differ by at
least eight (8) hours, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties.
3.3.1.5 If the New Conversion Time is more than one (1) business
hour from the original Scheduled Conversion Time or from
the previous New Conversion Time, the Party requesting
such New Conversion Time shall be subject to the following:
3.3.1.5.1 If Verizon requests to reschedule outside of the
one (1) hour time frame above, the Analog 2W
Loops Service Order Charge for the original
Scheduled Conversion Time or the previous
New Conversion Time shall be credited upon
request from PN; and
3.3.1.5.2 If PN requests to reschedule outside the one (1)
hour time frame above, PN shall be charged an
additional Analog 2W Loops Service Order
Charge for rescheduling the conversion to the
New Conversion Time.
3.3.1.6 If PN is not ready to accept service at the Scheduled
Conversion Time or at a New Conversion Time, as
applicable, an additional Service Order Charge shall apply.
If Verizon is not available or ready to perform the
conversion within thirty (30) minutes of the Scheduled
Conversion Time or New Conversion Time, as applicable,
Verizon and PN will reschedule and, upon request from PN,
Verizon will credit the Analog 2W Loop Service Order
Charge for the original Scheduled Conversion Time.
3.3.1.7 The standard time interval expected from disconnection of a
live Telephone Exchange Service to the connection of the
Analog 2W Loops to PN is fifteen (15) minutes per Analog
2W Loop for all orders consisting of twenty (20) Analog 2W

Loops or less. Orders involving more than twenty (20)
Loops will require a negotiated interval.
3.3.1.8 Conversions involving LNP will be completed according to
North American Numbering Council (NANC) standards, via
the regional Number Portability Administration Center
(NPAC).
3.3.1.9 If PN requires Analog 2W Loop conversions outside of the
regularly scheduled Verizon RCCC operating hours, such
conversions shall be separately negotiated. Additional
charges (e.g. overtime labor charges) may apply for desired
dates and times outside of regularly scheduled RCCC
operating hours.
3.4 [Intentionally Left Blank].
3.5 FTTP Loops.
3.5.1 New Builds. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or
any Verizon Tariff, PN shall not be entitled to obtain access to a FTTP
Loop, or any segment thereof, on an unbundled basis when Verizon
deploys such a Loop to the Customer premises of an end user that has
not been served by any Verizon Loop other than a FTTP Loop.
3.5.2 Overbuilds. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or
any Verizon Tariff, if (a) Verizon deploys an FTTP Loop to replace a
copper Loop previously used to serve a particular end user’s customer
premises, and (b) Verizon retires that copper Loop and there are no
other available copper Loops or Hybrid Loops for PN's provision of a
voice grade service to that end user’s customer premises, then in
accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the Federal
Unbundling Rules, Verizon shall provide PN with nondiscriminatory
access on an unbundled basis to a transmission path capable of
providing DS0 voice grade service to that end user’s customer
premises.

this Attachment, when PN seeks access to a Hybrid Loop for the
provision of "broadband services," as such term is defined by the FCC,
then in accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the Federal
Unbundling Rules, Verizon shall provide PN with unbundled access to
the existing time division multiplexing features, functions, and
capabilities of that Hybrid Loop, including DS1 or DS3 capacity (but
only where impairment has been found to exist, which, for the
avoidance of any doubt, does not include instances where Verizon is
not required to provide unbundled access to a DS1 Loop or a DS3
Loop under Section 1 of this Attachment) to establish a complete time
division multiplexing transmission path between the main distribution

frame (or equivalent) in a Verizon End Office serving an end user to
the demarcation point at the end user's Customer premises. This
access includes access to all features, functions, and capabilities of
the Hybrid Loop that are not used to transmit packetized information.
3.6.3 Narrowband Services. Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1
of this Attachment, when PN seeks access to a Hybrid Loop for the
provision to its Customer of “narrowband services,” as such term is
defined by the FCC, then in accordance with, but only to the extent
required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules, Verizon shall, in its sole
discretion, either (a) provide access to a spare home-run copper Loop
serving that Customer on an unbundled basis, or (b) provide access,
on an unbundled basis, to a DS0 voice-grade transmission path
between the main distribution frame (or equivalent) in the end user’s
serving End Office and the end user’s Customer premises, using time
division multiplexing technology.
3.6.4 IDLC Hybrid Loops and Loops Provisioned via Loop Concentrator.
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment, if PN
requests, in order to provide narrowband services, unbundling of a 2
wire analog or 4 wire analog Loop currently provisioned via Integrated

technology deployed as a Loop concentrator Verizon shall, in
accordance with but only to the extent required by the Federal
Unbundling Rules, provide PN unbundled access to a Loop capable of
voice-grade service to the end user Customer served by the Hybrid
Loop.
3.6.4.1 Verizon will endeavor to provide PN with an existing copper
Loop or a Loop served by existing Universal Digital Loop
Carrier (“UDLC”). Standard recurring and non-recurring
Loop charges will apply. In addition, a non-recurring charge
will apply whenever a line and station transfer is performed.
3.6.4.2 If neither a copper Loop nor a Loop served by UDLC is
available, Verizon shall, upon request of PN, provide
unbundled access to a DS0 voice-grade transmission path
between the main distribution frame (or equivalent) in the
end user’s serving End Office and the end user’s Customer
premises via such technically feasible alternative that
Verizon in its sole discretion may elect to employ. In
addition to the rates and charges payable in connection with
any unbundled Loop so provisioned by Verizon, PN shall be
responsible for any of the following charges that apply in the
event the technically feasible option involves construction,
installation, or modification of facilities: (a) an engineering
query charge for preparation of a price quote; (b) upon PN’s
submission of a firm construction order, an engineering
work order nonrecurring charge; and (c) construction
charges, as set forth in the price quote. If the order is
cancelled by PN after construction work has started, PN
shall be responsible for cancellation charges and a pro-
rated charge for construction work performed prior to the
cancellation.
3.6.4.3 Verizon may exclude its performance in connection with
providing unbundled Loops pursuant to this Section 3.6.4

from standard provisioning intervals and performance
measures and remedies, if any, contained in the Agreement
or elsewhere.
4. Line Splitting (also referred to as “Loop Sharing”)
4.1 Line Splitting is a process in which one CLEC provides narrowband voice service
over the low frequency portion of an unbundled copper Loop obtained from
Verizon (such CLEC may be referred to as the "VLEC") and a second CLEC
provides digital subscriber line service over the high frequency portion of that
same Loop (such CLEC may be referred to as the "DLEC"). Line Splitting is
accomplished through the use of a splitter collocated at the Verizon central office
where the Loop terminates into a distribution frame or its equivalent.
4.2 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment, PN may
engage in Line Splitting, in accordance with this Section 4 and the rates and
charges provided for in the Pricing Attachment. Verizon shall provide access to
Line Splitting in accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the Federal
Unbundling Rules.
4.3 Any Line Splitting between PN and another CLEC shall be accomplished by prior
negotiated arrangement between PN and the other CLEC. PN shall give Verizon
written notice of this arrangement through the Verizon Partner Solutions Local
Service Customer Profile Form (formerly referred to as the Verizon Wholesale
Local Service Customer Profile Form) on the Verizon Partner Solutions website
(formerly referred to as the Verizon wholesale website), or such other electronic
notice mechanism that Verizon may make available, at least thirty (30) days prior
to placing an order for a Line Splitting arrangement with such other CLEC. The
other CLEC must have an interconnection agreement with Verizon that permits it
to engage in Line Splitting with PN. The VLEC shall be responsible for all rates
and charges associated with the subject Loop as well as rates and charges
associated with the DLEC's use of the high frequency portion of the Loop,
including, but not limited to, service order charges, provisioning and installation
charges, central office wiring, loop qualification charges, and OSS charges.
4.4 In order to facilitate PN’s engaging in Line Splitting pursuant to this Section 4, PN
may order for use in a Line Splitting arrangement, those Network Elements,
Combinations, Collocation arrangements, services, facilities, equipment and
arrangements, appropriate for Line Splitting, that are offered to PN by Verizon
under the other sections of this Agreement. Such Network Elements,
Combinations, Collocation arrangements, services, facilities, equipment and
arrangements, will be provided to PN in accordance with, and subject to, the
rates and charges and other provisions of this Agreement and Verizon’s
applicable Tariffs. Verizon shall be obligated to provide Network Elements,
Combinations, Collocation arrangements, services, facilities, equipment and
arrangements, for Line Splitting only to the extent required by the Federal
Unbundling Rules.
4.5 PN and/or the other participating CLEC shall provide any splitters and/or Digital
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers used in a Line Splitting arrangement.
4.6 The standard provisioning interval for the Line Splitting arrangement shall be as
set out in the Verizon Product Interval Guide; provided that the standard
provisioning interval for a Line Splitting arrangement shall not exceed the
shortest of the following intervals: (1) the standard provisioning interval for a Line
Splitting arrangement if stated in an applicable Verizon Tariff; or, (2) the standard
provisioning interval for a Line Splitting arrangement, if any, established in

accordance with the Federal Unbundling Rules. The standard provisioning
interval for a Line Splitting arrangement shall commence only after any required
engineering and conditioning tasks have been completed. The standard
provisioning interval shall not apply where a Line and Station Transfer is
performed.
4.7 Verizon shall not be liable for any claims, damages, penalties, liabilities or the
like of any kind for disruptions to either PN’s or the other CLEC’s respective voice
or data services over a Line Splitting arrangement.

Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment and upon request by
PN, Verizon shall allow PN to access Sub-Loops unbundled from local switching and
transport, in accordance with the terms of this Section 6 and the rates and charges set
forth in the Pricing Attachment. Verizon shall allow PN access to Sub-Loops in
accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules. The
available Sub-Loop types are as set forth below.
6.1 Unbundled Sub-Loop Arrangement– Distribution (USLA).
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment and upon
request by PN, Verizon shall provide PN with access to a Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and provisions of this
Section6.1, the rates set forth in the Pricing Attachment, and the rates, terms
and conditions set forth in Verizon’s applicable Tariffs. Verizon shall provide PN
with access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility in accordance with, but only to the
extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules.
6.1.1 PN may request that Verizon reactivate (if available) an unused drop
and NID or provide PN with access to a drop and NID that, at the time
of PN’s request, Verizon is using to provide service to the Customer
(as such term is hereinafter defined).
6.1.2 Upon site-specific request, PN may obtain access to the Sub-Loop
Distribution Facility at a technically feasible access point located near a
Verizon remote terminal equipment enclosure at the rates and charges
provided for in the Pricing Attachment. It is not technically feasible to
access the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility if a technician must access
the facility by removing a splice case to reach the wiring within the
cable. PN may obtain access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
through any method required by the Federal Unbundling Rules, in
addition to existing methods such as from a Telecommunications
outside plant interconnection cabinet (TOPIC) or, if PN is collocated at
a remote terminal equipment enclosure and the FDI for such Sub-Loop
Distribution Facility is located in such enclosure, from the collocation
arrangement of PN at such terminal. If PN obtains access to a Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility from a TOPIC, PN shall install a TOPIC on an
easement or Right of Way obtained by PN within 100 feet of the
Verizon FDI to which such Sub-Loop Distribution Facility is connected.
A TOPIC must comply with applicable industry standards. Subject to
the terms of applicable Verizon easements, Verizon shall furnish and
place an interconnecting cable between a Verizon FDI and a PN
TOPIC and Verizon shall install a termination block within such TOPIC.
Verizon shall retain title to and maintain the interconnecting cable.

Verizon shall not be responsible for building, maintaining or servicing
the TOPIC and shall not provide any power that might be required by
PN for any of PN's electronics in the TOPIC. PN shall provide any
easement, Right of Way or trenching or supporting structure required
for any portion of an interconnecting cable that runs beyond a Verizon
easement.
6.1.3 PN may request from Verizon by submitting a loop make-up
engineering query to Verizon, and Verizon shall provide to PN, the
following information regarding a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility that
serves an identified Customer: the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility’s
length and gauge; whether the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility has
loading and bridged tap; the amount of bridged tap (if any) on the Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility; and, the location of the FDI to which the Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility is connected.
6.1.4 To order access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility from a TOPIC, PN
must first request that Verizon connect the Verizon FDI to which the
Sub-Loop Distribution Facility is connected to a PN TOPIC. To make
such a request, PN must submit to Verizon an application (a “Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection Application”) that identifies
the FDI at which PN wishes to access the Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility. A Sub-Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection Application
shall state the location of the TOPIC, the size of the interconnecting
cable and a description of the cable’s supporting structure. A Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection Application shall also include
a five-year forecast of PN’s demand for access to Sub-Loop
Distribution Facilities at the requested FDI. PN must submit the
application fee set forth in the Pricing Attachment attached hereto and
Verizon’s applicable Tariffs (a “Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
Application Fee”) with Sub-Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection
Application. PN must submit Sub-Loop Interconnection Applications
to:
Collocation Applications
Verizon
Room 503
185 Franklin Street
Boston, MA 02110
E-Mail: collocation.applications@Verizon.com
6.1.5 Within sixty (60) days after it receives a complete Sub-Loop
Distribution Facility Interconnection Application for access to a Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility and the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
Application Fee for such application, Verizon shall provide to PN a
work order that describes the work that Verizon must perform to
provide such access (a “Sub-Loop Distribution Facility Work Order”)
and a statement of the cost of such work (a “Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility Interconnection Cost Statement”).
6.1.6 PN shall pay to Verizon fifty percent (50%) of the cost set forth in a
Sub-Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection Cost Statement within
sixty (60) days of PN’s receipt of such statement and the associated
Sub-Loop Distribution Facility Work Order, and Verizon shall not be
obligated to perform any of the work set forth in such order until

Verizon has received such payment. A Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
Interconnection Application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn if
PN breaches its payment obligation under this Section. Upon Verizon
’s completion of the work that Verizon must perform to provide PN with
access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility, Verizon shall bill PN, and
PN shall pay to Verizon, the balance of the cost set forth in the Sub-
Loop Distribution Facility Interconnection Cost Statement for such
access.
6.1.7 After Verizon has completed the installation of the interconnecting
cable to a PN TOPIC and PN has paid the full cost of such installation,
PN can request the connection of Verizon Sub-Loop Distribution
Facilities to the PN TOPIC. At the same time, PN shall advise Verizon
of the services that PN plans to provide over the Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility, request any conditioning of the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
and assign the pairs in the interconnecting cable. PN shall run any
crosswires within the TOPIC.
6.1.8 If PN requests that Verizon reactivate an unused drop and NID, then
PN shall provide dial tone (or its DSL equivalent) on the PN side of the
applicable Verizon FDI at least twenty-four (24) hours before the due
date. On the due date, a Verizon technician will run the appropriate
cross connection to connect the Verizon Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
to the PN dial tone or equivalent from the TOPIC. If PN requests that
Verizon provide PN with access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
that, at the time of PN’s request, Verizon is using to provide service to
a Customer, then, after PN has looped two interconnecting pairs
through the TOPIC and at least twenty four (24) hours before the due
date, a Verizon technician shall crosswire the dial tone from the
Verizon central office through the Verizon side of the TOPIC and back
out again to the Verizon FDI and Verizon Sub-Loop Distribution Facility
using the “loop through” approach. On the due date, PN shall
disconnect Verizon’s dial tone, crosswire its dial tone to the Sub-Loop
Distribution Facility and submit PN’s LNP request.
6.1.9 Verizon will not provide access to a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility if
Verizon is using the loop of which the Sub-Loop Distribution Facility is
a part to provide line sharing service to another CLEC or a service that
uses derived channel technology to a Customer unless such other
CLEC first terminates the Verizon-provided line sharing or such
Customer first disconnects the service that utilizes derived channel
technology.
6.1.10 Verizon shall provide PN with access to a Sub-Loop Distribution
Facility in accordance with negotiated intervals
6.1.11 Verizon shall repair and maintain a Sub-Loop Distribution Facility at the
request of PN and subject to the time and material rates set forth in
Pricing Attachment and the rates, terms and conditions of Verizon’s
applicable Tariffs. PN accepts responsibility for initial trouble isolation
for Sub-Loop Distribution Facilities and providing Verizon with
appropriate dispatch information based on its test results. If (a) PN
reports to Verizon a Customer trouble, (b) PN requests a dispatch, (c)
Verizon dispatches a technician, and (d) such trouble was not caused
by Verizon Sub-Loop Distribution Facility facilities or equipment in
whole or in part, PN shall pay Verizon the charges set forth in the
Pricing Attachment and Verizon’s applicable Tariffs for time associated

with said dispatch. In addition, these charges also apply when the
Customer contact as designated by PN is not available at the
appointed time. If as the result of PN instructions, Verizon is
erroneously requested to dispatch to a site on Verizon company
premises (“dispatch in”), the charges set forth in Pricing Attachment
and Verizon’s applicable Tariffs will be assessed per occurrence to PN
by Verizon. If as the result of PN instructions, Verizon is erroneously
requested to dispatch to a site outside of Verizon company premises
("dispatch out"), the charges set forth in Pricing Attachment and
Verizon’s applicable Tariffs will be assessed per occurrence to PN by
Verizon.
6.2 [Intentionally Left Blank].
6.3 Collocation in Remote Terminals.
To the extent required by Applicable Law, Verizon shall allow PN to collocate
equipment in a Verizon remote terminal equipment enclosure in accordance with,
and subject to, the rates, terms and conditions set forth in the Collocation
Attachment and the Pricing Attachment.
7. Sub-Loop for Multiunit Tenant Premises Access
[Intentionally Left Blank].
8. Dark Fiber Transport and Transitional Provision of Embedded Dark Fiber Loops
8.1 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment and upon
request by PN, Verizon shall provide PN with access to unbundled Dark Fiber
Transport in accordance with, and subject to, the rates, terms and conditions
provided in the Pricing Attachment and rates, terms and conditions of Verizon’s
applicable Tariffs. Verizon shall not be required to provide, and PN shall not
request or obtain, unbundled access to any dark fiber facility that does not meet
the definition of Dark Fiber Transport (except to the extent Verizon is required to
provide PN with unbundled access to PN's embedded base of Dark Fiber Loops
under Section 8.3 below). For the avoidance of any doubt, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, a Verizon Tariff, or otherwise, Verizon shall not
be required to provide, and PN shall not request or obtain, Dark Fiber Transport
that does not connect a pair of Verizon UNE Wire Centers. Access to unbundled
Dark Fiber Transport will be provided by Verizon only where existing facilities are
available except as provided in Section 17 below. Access to Dark Fiber
Transport will be provided in accordance with, but only to the extent required by,
the Federal Unbundling Rules. Dark Fiber Transport consists of Verizon optical
transmission facilities without attached multiplexers, aggregation or other
electronics. To the extent Verizon’s Dark Fiber Transport contains any lightwave
repeaters (e.g., regenerators or optical amplifiers) installed thereon, Verizon shall
not remove the same. Except as otherwise required by the Federal Unbundling
Rules, the following terms and conditions apply to Verizon's Dark Fiber Transport
offerings.
8.2 In addition to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to Dark Fiber Transport:
8.2.1 [Intentionally Left Blank].
8.2.2 PNmay access Dark Fiber Transport only at a pre-existing Verizon
accessible terminal of such Dark Fiber Transport, and PN may not

access Dark Fiber Transport at any other point, including, but not
limited to, a splice point or case. Dark Fiber Transport is not available
to PN unless such Dark Transport is already terminated on an existing
Verizon accessible terminal. Unused fibers located in a cable vault or
a controlled environment vault, manhole or other location outside the
Verizon UNE Wire Center, and not terminated to a fiber patch panel,
are not available to PN.
8.2.3 Except if and, to the extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules
and Section 17 below, Verizon will not perform splicing (e.g., introduce
additional splice points or open existing splice points or cases) to
accommodate PN’s request.
8.2.4 Verizon shall perform all work necessary to install a cross connect or a
fiber jumper from a Verizon accessible terminal to a PN collocation
arrangement.
8.2.5 A "Dark Fiber Inquiry Form" must be submitted prior to submitting an
ASR. Upon receipt of PN’s completed Dark Fiber Inquiry Form,
Verizon will initiate a review of its cable records to determine whether
Dark Fiber Transport may be available between the locations and in
the quantities specified. Verizon will respond within fifteen (15)
Business Days from receipt of the PN’s Dark Fiber Inquiry Form,
indicating whether Dark Fiber Transport may be available (if so
available, an “Acknowledgement”) based on the records search except
that for voluminous requests or large, complex projects, Verizon
reserves the right to negotiate a different interval. The Dark Fiber
Inquiry is a record search and does not guarantee the availability of
Dark Fiber Transport. Where a direct Dark Fiber Transport route is not
available, Verizon will provide, where available, Dark Fiber Transport
via a reasonable indirect route that passes through intermediate
Verizon Central Offices at the rates set forth in the Pricing Attachment.
In cases where Verizon provides Dark Fiber Transport via an indirect
route as described in this section, PN shall not be permitted to access
the Dark Fiber Transport at any intermediate central office between the
two Verizon central offices that are the end points of the route. In no
event shall Verizon be required to provide Dark Fiber Transport
between two central offices that are the end points of a route on which
Verizon is not required under the Federal Unbundling Rules to provide
Dark Fiber Transport to PN. Verizon reserves the right to limit the
number of intermediate Verizon Central Offices on an indirect route
consistent with limitations in Verizon’s network design and/or prevailing
industry practices for optical transmission applications. Any limitations
on the number of intermediate Verizon Central Offices will be
discussed with PN. If access to Dark Fiber Transport is not available,
Verizon will notify PN, within fifteen (15) Business Days, that no spare
Dark Fiber Transport is available over the direct route nor any
reasonable alternate indirect route, except that for voluminous
requests or large, complex projects, Verizon reserves the right to
negotiate a different interval. Where no available route was found
during the record review, Verizon will identify the first blocked segment
on each alternate indirect route and which segment(s) in the alternate
indirect route are available prior to encountering a blockage on that
route, at the rates set forth in the Pricing Attachment.

8.2.5.1 PN shall indicate on the Dark Fiber Inquiry Form whether
the available Dark Fiber should be reserved, at the rates set
forth in the Pricing Attachment, pending receipt of an order
for the Dark Fiber.
8.2.5.2 Upon request from PN as indicated on the Dark Fiber
Inquiry Form, Verizon shall hold such requested Dark Fiber
Transport for PN’s use for ten (10) Business Days from
PN’s receipt of Acknowledgement and may not allow any
other party (including Verizon) to use such fiber during that
time period.
8.2.5.3 PN shall submit an order for the reserved Dark Fiber
Transport as soon as possible using the standard ordering
process or parallel provisioning process as described in
Section 8.2.5.5. The standard ordering process shall be
used when PN does not have additional requirements for
collocation. The parallel provisioning process shall be used
when PN requires new collocation facilities or changes to
existing collocation arrangements.
8.2.5.4 If no order is received from PN for the reserved Dark Fiber
Transport within ten (10) Business Days from PN’s receipt
of Acknowledgement, Verizon shall return to spare the
reserved Dark Fiber Transport that Verizon previously
notified PN are available. Should PN submit an order to
Verizon after the ten (10) Business Day reservation period
for access to Dark Fiber Transport that Verizon has
previously notified PN was available, PN assumes all risk
that such Dark Fiber Transport will no longer be available.
8.2.5.5 Upon PN’s request, the Parties will conduct parallel
provisioning of collocation and Dark Fiber Transport in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
8.2.5.5.1 PN will use existing interfaces and Verizon’s
current applications and order forms to request
collocation and Dark Fiber Transport.
8.2.5.5.2 Verizon will parallel process PN’s requests for
collocation, including augments, and Dark Fiber
Transport.
8.2.5.5.3 Before PN submits a request for parallel
provisioning of collocation and Dark Fiber
Transport, PN will:
8.2.5.5.3.1 submit a Dark Fiber Inquiry Form
and receive an Acknowledgement
from Verizon; and
8.2.5.5.3.2 submit a collocation application
for the Verizon Central Office(s)
where the Dark Fiber Transport
terminates and receive
confirmation from Verizon that
PN’s collocation application has

been accepted.
8.2.5.5.4 PN will prepare requests for parallel provisioning
of collocation and Dark Fiber Transport in the
manner and form reasonably specified by
Verizon.
8.2.5.5.5 If Verizon rejects PN’s Dark Fiber Transport
request, PN may cancel its collocation
application within five (5) Business Days of such
rejection and receive a refund of the collocation
application fee paid by PN, less the costs
Verizon incurred to date.
8.2.5.5.6 If Verizon accepts PN’s Dark Fiber Transport
request, Verizon will parallel provision the Dark
Transport to a temporary location in Verizon’s
Central Office(s). Verizon will charge and PN
will pay for parallel provisioning of such Dark
Fiber Transport at the rates specified in the
Pricing Attachment beginning on the date that
Verizon accepts each Dark Fiber Transport
request.
8.2.5.5.7 Within ten (10) days after Verizon completes a
PN collocation application, PN shall submit a
Dark Fiber change request to reposition Dark
Fiber Transport from the temporary location in
that Verizon Central Office(s) to the permanent
location at PN’s collocation arrangement in such
Verizon Central Office(s). PN will prepare such
request(s) in the manner and form specified by
Verizon.
8.2.5.5.8 If PN cancels its collocation application, PN
must also submit a cancellation for the
unbundled Dark Fiber Transport provisioned to
the temporary location in the Verizon Central
Office(s).
8.2.6 PN shall order Dark Fiber Transport by sending to Verizon a separate
ASR for each A to Z route.
8.2.7 Where a collocation arrangement can be accomplished in a Verizon
premises, access to Dark Fiber Transport that terminates in a Verizon
premises must be accomplished via a collocation arrangement in that
Verizon premises. In circumstances where a collocation arrangement
cannot be accomplished in a Verizon premises, the Parties agree to
negotiate for possible alternative arrangements.
8.2.8 Except as provided in Section 17 below, Dark Fiber Transport will be
offered to PNin the condition that it is available in Verizon's network at
the time that PN submits its request (i.e., "as is"). In addition, Verizon
shall not be required to convert lit fiber to Dark Fiber Transport for PN’s
use.

8.2.9 Spare wavelengths on fiber strands, where Wave Division Multiplexing
(WDM) or Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) equipment is
deployed, are not considered to be Dark Fiber Transport, and,
therefore, will not be offered to PN as Dark Fiber Transport.
8.2.10 Fiber that has been assigned to fulfill a Customer order for
maintenance purposes or for Verizon’s lit fiber optic systems will not be
offered to PN as Dark Fiber Transport.
8.2.11 PN shall be responsible for providing all transmission, terminating and
lightwave repeater equipment necessary to light and use Dark Fiber
Transport.
8.2.12 PN may not resell Dark Fiber Transport, purchased pursuant to this
Agreement to third parties.
8.2.13 Except to the extent that Verizon is required by the Federal Unbundling
Rules to provide Dark Fiber Transport to PN for use for Special or
Switched Exchange Access Services, PN shall not use Dark Fiber
Transport, for Special or Switched Exchange Access Services.
8.2.14 In order to preserve the efficiency of its network, Verizon may, upon a
showing of need to the Commission, limit PN to leasing up to a
maximum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the Dark Fiber Transport in
any given segment of Verizon's network. In addition, except as
otherwise required by the Federal Unbundling Rules, Verizon may take
any of the following actions, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement:
8.2.14.1 Revoke Dark Fiber Transport leased to PN upon a showing
of need to the Commission and twelve (12) months'
advance written notice to PN; and
8.2.14.2 Verizon reserves and shall not waive, Verizon’s right to
claim before the Commission that Verizon should not have
to fulfill a PN order for Dark Transport because that request
would strand an unreasonable amount of fiber capacity,
disrupt or degrade service to Customers or carriers other
than PN, or impair Verizon’s ability to meet a legal
obligation.
8.2.15 Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, PN may not reserve
Dark Fiber Transport.
8.2.16 PN shall be solely responsible for: (a) determining whether or not the
transmission characteristics of the Dark Fiber Transport accommodate
the requirements of PN; (b) obtaining any Rights of Way, governmental
or private property permit, easement or other authorization or approval
required for access to the Dark Fiber Transport; (c) installation of fiber
optic transmission equipment needed to power the Dark Fiber
Transport to transmit permitted traffic; and (d) except as set forth with
respect to the parallel provisioning process addressed above, PN’s
collocation arrangements with any proper optical cross connects or
other equipment that PN needs to access Dark Fiber Transport before
it submits an order for such access. PN hereby represents and
warrants that it shall have all such rights of way, authorizations and the
like applicable to the location at which it wishes to establish a

demarcation point for Dark Fiber Transport, on or before the date that
PNplaces an order for the applicable Dark Fiber Transport, and that it
shall maintain the same going forward.
8.2.17 PN is responsible for trouble isolation before reporting trouble to
Verizon. Verizon will restore continuity to Dark Fiber Transport that
has been broken. Verizon will not repair Dark Fiber Transport that is
capable of transmitting light, even if the transmission characteristics of
the Dark Fiber Transport has changed.
8.2.18 [Intentionally Left Blank].
8.2.19 PN may request the following, which shall be provided on a time and
materials basis (as set forth in the Pricing Attachment):
8.2.19.1 [Intentionally Left Blank].
8.2.19.2 A field survey that shows the availability of Dark Fiber
Transport between two or more Verizon Central Offices,
shows whether or not such Dark Fiber Transport is
defective, shows whether or not such Dark Fiber Transport
has been used by Verizon for emergency restoration
activity, and tests the transmission characteristics of
Verizon’s Dark Fiber Transport. If a field survey shows that
Dark Fiber Transport is available, PN may reserve the Dark
Fiber Transport, as applicable, for ten (10) Business Days
from receipt of Verizon’s field survey results. If PN submits
an order for access to such Dark Fiber Transport after
passage of the foregoing ten (10) Business Day reservation
period, Verizon does not guarantee or warrant the Dark
Fiber Transport will be available when Verizon receives
such order, and PN assumes all risk that the Dark Fiber
Transport will not be available. Verizon shall perform a field
survey subject to a negotiated interval. If a PN submits an
order for Dark Fiber Transport without first obtaining the
results of a field survey of such Dark Fiber Transport, PN
assumes all risk that the Dark Fiber Transport will not be
compatible with PN’s equipment, including, but not limited
to, order cancellation charges.
8.3 Transitional Provision of Embedded Dark Fiber Loops.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Verizon is not required to
provide, and PN may not obtain, unbundled access to any Dark Fiber Loop;
provided, however, that if PN leased a Dark Fiber Loop from Verizon as of March
11, 2005, PN may continue to lease that Dark Fiber Loop at transitional rates
provided for in the TRRO until September 10, 2006, and not beyond that date.
The Parties acknowledge that Verizon, prior to the Effective Date, has provided
PN with any required notices of discontinuance of Dark Fiber Loops, and that no
further notice is required for Verizon to exercise its rights with respect to
discontinuance of Dark Fiber Loops.
9. Network Interface Device
9.1 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment and upon
request by PN, Verizon shall permit PN to connect a PN Loop to the Inside
Wiring of a Customer's premises through the use of a Verizon NID in accordance

with this Section 9 and the rates and charges provided in the Pricing Attachment.
Verizon shall provide PN with access to NIDs in accordance with, but only to the
extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules. PN may access a Verizon
NID either by means of a connection (but only if the use of such connection is
technically feasible) from an adjoining PN NID deployed by PN or, if an entrance
module is available in the Verizon NID, by connecting a PN Loop to the Verizon
NID. When necessary, Verizon will rearrange its facilities to provide access to an
existi7ng Customer’s Inside Wire. An entrance module is available only if
facilities are not connected to it.
9.2 In no case shall PN access, remove, disconnect or in any other way rearrange
Verizon’s Loop facilities from Verizon’s NIDs, enclosures, or protectors.
9.3 In no case shall PN access, remove, disconnect or in any other way rearrange, a
Customer’s Inside Wiring from Verizon’s NIDs, enclosures, or protectors where
such Customer Inside Wiring is used in the provision of ongoing
Telecommunications Service to that Customer.
9.4 In no case shall PN remove or disconnect ground wires from Verizon’s NIDs,
enclosures, or protectors.
9.5 In no case shall PN remove or disconnect NID modules, protectors, or terminals
from Verizon’s NID enclosures.
9.6 Maintenance and control of premises Inside Wiring is the responsibility of the
Customer. Any conflicts between service providers for access to the Customer’s
Inside Wiring must be resolved by the person who controls use of the wiring
(e.g., the Customer).
9.7 When PN is connecting a PN-provided Loop to the Inside Wiring of a Customer’s
premises through the Customer’s side of the Verizon NID, PN does not need to
submit a request to Verizon and Verizon shall not charge PN for access to the
Verizon NID. In such instances, PN shall comply with the provisions of Sections
9.2 through 9.7 of this Attachment and shall access the Customer’s Inside Wire
in the manner set forth in Section 9.8 of this Attachment.
9.8 Due to the wide variety of NIDs utilized by Verizon (based on Customer size and
environmental considerations), PN may access the Customer’s Inside Wiring,
acting as the agent of the Customer by any of the following means:
9.8.1 Where an adequate length of Inside Wiring is present and
environmental conditions permit, PN may remove the Inside Wiring
from the Customer’s side of the Verizon NID and connect that Inside
Wiring to PN’s NID.
9.8.2 Where an adequate length of Inside Wiring is not present or
environmental conditions do not permit, PN may enter the Customer
side of the Verizon NID enclosure for the purpose of removing the
Inside Wiring from the terminals of Verizon’s NID and connecting a
connectorized or spliced jumper wire from a suitable “punch out” hole
of such NID enclosure to the Inside Wiring within the space of the
Customer side of the Verizon NID. Such connection shall be
electrically insulated and shall not make any contact with the
connection points or terminals within the Customer side of the Verizon
NID.

9.8.3 PN may request Verizon to make other rearrangements to the Inside
Wiring terminations or terminal enclosure on a time and materials cost
basis to be charged to the requesting party (i.e. PN, its agent, the
building owner or the Customer). If PN accesses the Customer’s
Inside Wiring as described in this Section 9.8.3, time and materials
charges will be billed to the requesting party (i.e. PN, its agent, the
building owner or the Customer).
10. [This Section Intentionally Left Blank]
11. Dedicated Transport
11.1 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment, where facilities
are available, at PN’s request, Verizon shall provide PN with Dedicated Transport
unbundled from other Network Elements at the rates set forth in the Pricing
Attachment. Verizon shall provide PN with such Dedicated Transport in
accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the Federal Unbundling
Rules. Except as provided in Section 17 below, Verizon will not install new
electronics, and Verizon will not build new facilities. For the avoidance of any
doubt, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Verizon shall not
be required to provide, and PN shall not request or obtain, unbundled access to
shared (or common) transport, or any other interoffice transport facility that does
not meet the definition of Dedicated Transport.
11.2 If and, to the extent that, PN has purchased (or purchases) transport from
Verizon under a Verizon Tariff or otherwise, and PN has a right under the
Federal Unbundling Rules to convert (and wishes to convert) such transport to
unbundled Dedicated Transport under this Agreement, it shall give Verizon
written notice of such request (including, without limitation, through submission of
ASRs if Verizon so requests) and provide to Verizon all information (including,
without limitation, a listing of the specific circuits in question) that Verizon
reasonably requires to effectuate such conversion. In the case of any such
conversion, PN shall pay any and all conversion charges (e.g., non-recurring
charges), as well as any and all termination liabilities, minimum service period
charges and like charges in accordance with Verizon’s applicable Tariffs. If the
transport to be converted comprises a portion of a High Capacity EEL (as defined
in Section 16.2.1 below), the applicable provisions of Section 16 below shall
apply.
12. [This Section Intentionally Left Blank]
13. Operations Support Systems
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Attachment and in Section 8 of the
Additional Services Attachment, Verizon shall provide PN with access via electronic
interfaces to databases required for pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning, maintenance
and repair, and billing. Verizon shall provide PN with such access in accordance with,
but only to the extent required by, the Federal Unbundling Rules. All such transactions
shall be submitted by PN through such electronic interfaces.
14. Availability of Other Network Elements on an Unbundled Basis
14.1 Any request by PN for access to a Verizon Network Element that is not already
available and that Verizon is required by the Federal Unbundling Rules to provide
on an unbundled basis shall be treated as a Network Element Bona Fide
Request pursuant to Section 14.3, of this Attachment. PN shall provide Verizon

access to its Network Elements as mutually agreed by the Parties or as required
by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
14.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 14, a Party shall not be
required to provide a proprietary Network Element to the other Party under this
Section14 except as required by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
14.3 Network Element Bona Fide Request (BFR).
14.3.1 Each Party shall promptly consider and analyze access to a new
unbundled Network Element in response to the submission of a
Network Element Bona Fide Request by the other Party hereunder.
The Network Element Bona Fide Request process set forth herein
does not apply to those services requested pursuant to Report & Order
and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 91-141 (rel. Oct. 19, 1992) ¶ 259
and n.603 or subsequent orders.
14.3.2 A Network Element Bona Fide Request shall be submitted in writing
and shall include a technical description of each requested Network
Element.
14.3.3 The requesting Party may cancel a Network Element Bona Fide
Request at any time, but shall pay the other Party's reasonable and
demonstrable costs of processing and/or implementing the Network
Element Bona Fide Request up to the date of cancellation.
14.3.4 Within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt, the receiving Party shall
acknowledge receipt of the Network Element Bona Fide Request.
14.3.5 Except under extraordinary circumstances, within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of a Network Element Bona Fide Request, the receiving Party
shall provide to the requesting Party a preliminary analysis of such
Network Element Bona Fide Request. The preliminary analysis shall
confirm that the receiving Party will offer access to the Network
Element or will provide a detailed explanation that access to the
Network Element is not technically feasible and/or that the request
does not qualify as a Network Element that is required to be provided
by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
14.3.6 If the receiving Party determines that the Network Element Bona Fide
Request is technically feasible and access to the Network Element is
required to be provided by the Federal Unbundling Rules, it shall
promptly proceed with developing the Network Element Bona Fide
Request upon receipt of written authorization from the requesting
Party. When it receives such authorization, the receiving Party shall
promptly develop the requested services, determine their availability,
calculate the applicable prices and establish installation intervals.
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the Network Element requested
must be priced in accordance with Section 252(d)(1) of the Act.
14.3.7 As soon as feasible, but not more than ninety (90) days after its receipt
of authorization to proceed with developing the Network Element Bona
Fide Request, the receiving Party shall provide to the requesting Party
a Network Element Bona Fide Request quote which will include, at a
minimum, a description of each Network Element, the availability, the
applicable rates, and the installation intervals.

14.3.8 Within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Network Element Bona Fide
Request quote, the requesting Party must either confirm its order for
the Network Element Bona Fide Request pursuant to the Network
Element Bona Fide Request quote or seek arbitration by the
Commission pursuant to Section 252 of the Act.
14.3.9 If a Party to a Network Element Bona Fide Request believes that the
other Party is not requesting, negotiating or processing the Network
Element Bona Fide Request in good faith, or disputes a determination,
or price or cost quote, or is failing to act in accordance with Section
251 of the Act, such Party may seek mediation or arbitration by the
Commission pursuant to Section 252 of the Act.
15. Maintenance of Network Elements
If (a) PN reports to Verizon a Customer trouble, (b) PN requests a dispatch, (c) Verizon
dispatches a technician, and (d) such trouble was not caused by Verizon’s facilities or
equipment in whole or in part, then PN shall pay Verizon a charge set forth in the Pricing
Attachment for time associated with said dispatch. In addition, this charge also applies
when the Customer contact as designated by PN is not available at the appointed time.
PN accepts responsibility for initial trouble isolation and providing Verizon with
appropriate dispatch information based on its test results. If, as the result of PN
instructions, Verizon is erroneously requested to dispatch to a site on Verizon company
premises (“dispatch in”), a charge set forth in the Pricing Attachment will be assessed per
occurrence to PN by Verizon. If as the result of PN instructions, Verizon is erroneously
requested to dispatch to a site outside of Verizon company premises ("dispatch out"), a
charge set forth in the Pricing Attachment will be assessed per occurrence to PN by
Verizon. Verizon agrees to respond to PN trouble reports on a non-discriminatory basis
consistent with the manner in which it provides service to its own retail Customers or to
any other similarly situated Telecommunications Carrier.
16. Combinations, Commingling, and Conversions
16.1 Subject to and without limiting the conditions set forth in Section 1 of this
Attachment:
16.1.1 Verizon will not prohibit the commingling of a Qualifying UNE with
Qualifying Wholesale Services, but only to the extent and so long as
commingling and provision of such Network Element (or combination
of Network Elements) is required by the Federal Unbundling Rules.
Moreover, to the extent and so long as required by the Federal
Unbundling Rules, Verizon shall, upon request of PN, perform the
functions necessary to commingle Qualifying UNEs with Qualifying
Wholesale Services. The rates, terms and conditions of the applicable
access Tariff or separate non-251 agreement will apply to the
Qualifying Wholesale Services, and the rates, terms and conditions of
the Agreement or the Verizon UNE Tariff, as applicable, will apply to
the Qualifying UNEs; provided, however, that a nonrecurring charge
will apply for each UNE circuit that is part of a commingled
arrangement, as set forth in the Pricing Attachment. In addition, if any
commingling requested by PN requires Verizon to perform physical
work that Verizon is required to perform under the Federal Unbundling
Rules, then Verizon's standard charges for such work shall apply or, in
the absence of a standard charge, a fee calculated using Verizon's
standard time and materials rates shall apply until such time as a

standard charge is established pursuant to the terms set forth in the
Pricing Attachment.
16.1.2 Ratcheting, i.e., a pricing mechanism that involves billing a single
circuit at multiple rates to develop a single, blended rate, shall not be
required. UNEs that are commingled with Wholesale Services are not
included in the shared use provisions of the applicable Tariff, and are
therefore not eligible for adjustment of charges under such provisions.
Verizon may exclude its performance in connection with the
provisioning of commingled facilities and services from standard
provisioning intervals and from performance measures and remedies,
if any, contained in the Agreement or elsewhere.
16.1.3 Limitation on Section 16.1. Section 16.1 is intended only to address
the Parties' rights and obligations as to combining and/or commingling
of UNEs that Verizon is already required to provide to PN under the
Agreement and the Federal Unbundling Rules. Nothing contained in
Section 16.1 shall be deemed to limit any right of Verizon under the
Agreement to cease providing a facility that is or becomes a
Discontinued Facility.
16.2 Service Eligibility Criteria for Certain Combinations and Commingled Facilities
and Services. Subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 1 and 16.1 of this
Attachment:
16.2.1 Verizon shall not be obligated to provide:
16.2.1.1 an unbundled DS1 Loop in combination with unbundled
DS1 or DS3 Dedicated Transport, or commingled with DS1
or DS3 access services;
16.2.1.2 an unbundled DS3 Loop in combination with unbundled
DS3 Dedicated Transport, or commingled with DS3 access
services;
16.2.1.3 unbundled DS1 Dedicated Transport commingled with DS1
channel termination access service;
16.2.1.4 unbundled DS3 Dedicated Transport commingled with DS1
channel termination access service; or
16.2.1.5 unbundled DS3 Dedicated Transport commingled with DS3
channel termination service,
(individually and collectively “High Capacity EELs”) except to the extent
Verizon is required by the Federal Unbundling Rules to do so, and then
not unless and until PN, using an ASR, certifies to Verizon that each
combined or commingled DS1 circuit or DS1 equivalent circuit of a High
Capacity EEL satisfies each of the service eligibility criteria on a circuit-
by-circuit basis as set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 51.318. PN must remain in
compliance with said service eligibility criteria for so long as PN
continues to receive the aforementioned combined or commingled
facilities and/or services from Verizon and PN shall immediately notify
Verizon at such time as a certification ceases to be accurate. The
service eligibility criteria shall be applied to each combined or
commingled DS1 circuit or DS1 equivalent circuit of a High Capacity
EEL. If any combined or commingled DS1 circuit or DS1 equivalent

circuit of a High Capacity EEL is, becomes, or is subsequently
determined to be, noncompliant, the noncompliant High Capacity EEL
circuit will be treated as described in Section 16.2.2 below. The
foregoing shall apply whether the High Capacity EEL circuits in question
are being provisioned to establish a new circuit or to convert an existing
wholesale service, or any part thereof, to unbundled network elements.
For existing High Capacity EEL circuits, PN, within thirty (30) days of the
Effective Date to the extent it has not already done so prior to the
Effective Date of this Agreement, must re-certify, using an ASR, that
each DS1 circuit or DS1 equivalent circuit satisfies the service eligibility
criteria on a circuit-by-circuit basis as set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 51.318.
Any existing High Capacity EEL circuits that PN leased from Verizon as
of the Effective Date of this Agreement that PN fails to re-certify as
required by this Section by the end of such 30-day period shall be
treated as a non-compliant circuit as described under Section 16.2.2
below effective as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.
16.2.2 Without limiting any other right Verizon may have to cease providing
circuits that are or become Discontinued Facilities, if a High Capacity
EEL circuit is or becomes noncompliant as described in this Section
16.2 and PN has not submitted an LSR or ASR, as appropriate, to
Verizon requesting disconnection of the noncompliant facility and has
not separately secured from Verizon an alternative arrangement to
replace the noncompliant High Capacity EEL circuit, then Verizon, to
the extent it has not already done so prior to execution of this
Agreement, shall reprice the subject High Capacity EEL circuit (or
portion thereof that had been previously billed at UNE rates), effective
beginning on the date on which the circuit became non-compliant by
application of a new rate (or, in Verizon's sole discretion, by application
of a surcharge to an existing rate) to be equivalent to an analogous
access service or other analogous arrangement that Verizon shall
identify in a written notice to PN.
16.2.3 Each certification to be provided by PN pursuant to Section 16.2.1
above must contain the following information for each DS1 circuit or
DS1 equivalent: (a) the local number assigned to each DS1 circuit or
DS1 equivalent; (b) the local numbers assigned to each DS3 circuit
(must have 28 local numbers assigned to it); (c) the date each circuit
was established in the 911/E-911 database; (d) the collocation
termination connecting facility assignment for each circuit, showing that
the collocation arrangement was established pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §
251(c)(6), and not under a federal collocation tariff; (e) the
interconnection trunk circuit identification number that serves each
DS1 circuit. There must be one such identification number per every
24 DS1 circuits; and (f) the local switch that serves each DS1 circuit.
When submitting an ASR for a circuit, this information must be
contained in the Remarks section of the ASR, unless provisions are
made to populate other fields on the ASR to capture this information.
16.2.4 The charges for conversions are as specified in the Pricing Attachment
and apply for each circuit converted.
16.2.5 All ASR-driven conversion requests will result in a change in circuit
identification (circuit ID) from access to UNE or UNE to access. If such
change in circuit ID requires that the affected circuit(s) be retagged,

then a retag fee per circuit will apply as specified in the Pricing
Attachment.
16.2.6 All requests for conversions will be handled in accordance with
Verizon’s conversion guidelines. Each request will be handled as a
project and will be excluded from all ordering and provisioning metrics.
16.3 Once per calendar year, Verizon may obtain and pay for an independent auditor
to audit PN’s compliance in all material respects with the service eligibility criteria
applicable to High Capacity EELs. Any such audit shall be performed in
accordance with the standards established by the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants, and may include, at Verizon’s discretion, the examination of
a sample selected in accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment. To
the extent the independent auditor’s report concludes that PN failed to comply
with the service eligibility criteria, then (without limiting Verizon's rights under
Section 16.2.2 above) PN must convert all noncompliant circuits to the
appropriate service, true up any difference in payments, make the correct
payments on a going-forward basis, and reimburse Verizon for the cost of the
independent auditor within thirty (30) days after receiving a statement of such
costs from Verizon. Should the independent auditor confirm PN’s compliance
with the service eligibility criteria, then PN shall provide to the independent
auditor for its verification a statement of PN’s out-of-pocket costs of complying
with any requests of the independent auditor, and Verizon shall, within thirty (30)
days of the date on which PN submits such costs to the auditor, reimburse PN for
its out-of-pocket costs verified by the auditor. PN shall maintain records
adequate to support its compliance with the service eligibility criteria for each
DS1 or DS1 equivalent circuit for at least eighteen (18) months after the service
arrangement in question is terminated.
17. Routine Network Modifications
17.1 General Conditions. In accordance with, but only to the extent required by, the
Federal Unbundling Rules, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 1 of
this Attachment:
17.1.1 Verizon shall make such routine network modifications, at the rates
and charges set forth in the Pricing Attachment, as are necessary to
permit access by PN to the Loop, Dedicated Transport, or Dark Fiber
Transport facilities available under the Agreement (including DS1
Loops and DS1 Dedicated Transport, and DS3 Loops and DS3
Dedicated Transport), where the facility has already been constructed.

deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable; and routine activities, if
any, needed to enable PN to light a Dark Fiber Transport facility that it
has obtained from Verizon under the Agreement. Verizon shall not be
obligated to provide optronics for the purpose of lighting Dark Fiber
Transport. Routine network modifications do not include the

construction of a new Loop or new Transport facilities, trenching, the
pulling of cable, the installation of new aerial, buried, or underground
cable for a requesting telecommunications carrier, the placement of
new cable, securing permits or rights-of-way, or constructing and/or
placing new manholes or conduits. Verizon shall not be required to
build any time division multiplexing (TDM) capability into new packet-
based networks or into existing packet-based networks that do not
already have TDM capability. Verizon shall not be required to perform
any routine network modifications to any facility that is or becomes a
Discontinued Facility.
17.2 Performance Plans. Verizon may exclude its performance in connection with the
provisioning of Loops or Transport (including Dark Fiber Transport) for which
routine network modifications are performed from standard provisioning intervals
and performance measures and remedies, if any, contained in the Agreement or
elsewhere.
17.3 Nothing contained in this Section 17 shall be deemed: (a) to establish any
obligation of Verizon to provide on an unbundled basis under the Federal
Unbundling Rules any facility that this Agreement does not otherwise require
Verizon to provide on an unbundled basis under the Federal Unbundling Rules,
(b) to obligate Verizon to provide on an unbundled basis under the Federal
Unbundling Rules, for any period of time not required under the Federal
Unbundling Rules, access to any Discontinued Facility, or (c) to limit any right of
Verizon under the Agreement, any Verizon Tariff or SGAT, or otherwise, to cease
providing a Discontinued Facility.
18. Rates and Charges
The rates and charges for UNEs, Combinations, Commingling, routine network
modifications, and other services, facilities and arrangements, offered under this
Attachment shall be as provided in this Attachment and the Pricing Attachment.
19. Good Faith Performance
If and, to the extent that, Verizon, prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, has not
provided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a Service offered under this Attachment,
Verizon reserves the right to negotiate in good faith with PN reasonable terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, rates and implementation timeframes) for such
Service; and, if the Parties cannot agree to such terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, rates and implementation timeframes), either Party may utilize the Agreement’s
dispute resolution procedures.

1. Verizon’s Provision of Collocation
Verizon shall provide to PN, in accordance with this Agreement, Verizon’s applicable
federal and state Tariffs and the requirements of Applicable Law, Collocation for the
purpose of facilitating PN’s interconnection with Verizon under 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(2) or
access to Unbundled Network Elements of Verizon; provided, that notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or a Tariff, Verizon shall be obligated to provide
Collocation to PN only to the extent required by Applicable Law and may decline to
provide Collocation to PN to the extent that provision of Collocation is not required by
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a Tariff,
nothing in this Agreement or a Tariff shall be deemed to require Verizon to provide (and,
for the avoidance of any doubt, Verizon may decline to provide and/or cease providing)
Collocation that, if provided by Verizon, would be used by PN to obtain unbundled access
to any network element: (a) that Verizon is not required to unbundle under 47 U.S.C. §
251(c)(3) or (b) that Verizon is not required to unbundle under 47 C.F.R. Part 51.
