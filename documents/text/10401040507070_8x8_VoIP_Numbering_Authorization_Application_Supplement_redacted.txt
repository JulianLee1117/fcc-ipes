SUPPLEMENT TO THE APPLICATION OF 8X8, INC.

On December 19, 2019, 8x8, Inc. (“8x8”) respectfully requested authorization to obtain
numbering resources as an interconnected VoIP provider pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the
Commission’s Rules.
In response to 8x8’s application, the Wireline Competition Bureau requested additional
information to demonstrate proof of facilities readiness under Direct Access Order (FCC 15-70)
paragraph 37. In support of this application, 8x8 provides the following information:
I. INFORMATION REQUIRED BY SECTION 52.15(g)(3)(i)
c) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(C)
Prior to requesting numbers from the Numbering Administrators, 8x8 will file requests for
numbers with the relevant state authorities. 8x8 meant to list the states where it will request
numbering resources in Appendix A of its initial application, but omitted the Appendix in error.
8x8 now attaches Appendix A to this supplement.
d) § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D)
As stated in its initial application, 8x8 has agreements in place with a carrier partner who
in turn has interconnection agreements with local exchange carriers. Attached to 8x8’s application

as Confidential Exhibit A was an interconnection agreement between 8x8 and its carrier partner.
8x8 now attaches to this supplement an additional agreement between 8x8 and an affiliate of its
carrier partner that clarifies the terms within Confidential Exhibit A and further demonstrates 8x8’s
facilities readiness.1 This document is attached as Confidential Exhibit C and is submitted
pursuant to 8x8’s concurrently-filed request for confidential treatment.
II. CONCLUSION
8x8 respectfully submits this additional information.
Respectfully submitted,
