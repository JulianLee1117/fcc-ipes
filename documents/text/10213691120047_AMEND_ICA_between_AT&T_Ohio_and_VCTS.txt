5. Customer Information Services (CIS)
5.1. With the exception of 5.3 herein, delete all rates, terms and conditions pertaining to Customer Information
Services, including but not limited to services related to Operator Services (OS), Directory Assistance (DA),
Directory Assistance Listings (DAL), Inward Assistance Operator Services (INW) and White Pages (e.g.,
Busy Line Verification (BLV), Busy Line Verification/Interrupt (BLV/I), etc.) from the Agreement.
5.2. Add Attachment 06 - Operator Services and Directory Assistance (OS/DA), attached hereto as Exhibit A;
and the Operator Services and Directory Assistance (OS/DA) rates reflected in the Pricing Sheet, attached
hereto as Exhibit B, to the Agreement.
5.3. Add the following provisions to the Attachment or Appendix for Resale
CIS.1 For Resale service, AT&T will provide Customer Information Services to CLEC’s End Users where
technically feasible and/or available to AT&T retail End Users. Dialing, response, and sound
quality will be provided in parity to AT&T retail End Users.
CIS.2 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this
Attachment, including but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End
Users’ service locations.
CIS.3 Interexchange carrier traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services
messages) received by AT&T for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as unbillable
and will not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those messages
to the carrier indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be
billed by AT&T.
CIS.4 AT&T shall not be responsible for the manner in which utilization of Resale Services or the
associated charges are allocated to End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges
for services provided to CLEC under this Attachment will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the
responsibility of CLEC.
CIS.5 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC
regardless of CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
CIS.6 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for calling card, collect, or third
number billed calls (Alternately Billed Traffic or “ABT”) or toll and information services (for example,
900 calls), CLEC must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this
Attachment and pay any applicable charges. It is the responsibility of CLEC to order the
appropriate toll restriction or blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that
blocking is not available for certain types of calls, including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and
Directory Assistance Express Call Completion. Depending on the origination point, for example,
calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may bypass blocking systems. CLEC
acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any charges associated with
calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that bypass blocking
systems.
6. There shall be no retroactive application of any provision of this Amendment prior to the Effective Date of an adopting
CLEC’s agreement.

7. This Amendment shall be deemed to revise the terms and provisions of the Agreement only to the extent necessary
to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Amendment. In the event of a conflict between the terms and
provisions of this Amendment and the terms and provisions of the Agreement (including all incorporated or
accompanying Appendices, Addenda, and Exhibits to the Agreement), this Amendment shall govern, provided,

Agreement but not in this Amendment, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a conflict for
purposes of this Amendment.
8. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying
Agreement (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment)
with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not
yet fully incorporated into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
9. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall
be coterminous with such Agreement.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.

Attachment 06 – OS/DA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 9
VISION CTS
Version: 3Q16 - CLEC ICA – 9/19/16
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:

Contract Id: 4954102
Exhibit A
Attachment 06 – OS/DA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 9
VISION CTS
Version: 3Q16 - CLEC ICA – 9/19/16
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect

Exhibit A
Attachment 06 – OS/DA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 6 of 9
VISION CTS
Version: 3Q16 - CLEC ICA – 9/19/16
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.

Exhibit A
Attachment 06 – OS/DA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 7 of 9
VISION CTS
Version: 3Q16 - CLEC ICA – 9/19/16
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to state requirements and AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations
applicable to the provision of listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users,
non-discriminatory access to listings in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE makes listings available to
AT&T-21STATE retail End Users.
.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:
4.2.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-
Published listings will be subject to the rates as set forth in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs
and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not provide a resale discount for
any listings.

4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 White Page Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to state requirements and AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations
applicable to the provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy
per primary End User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages
directory in the same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-
21STATE’s retail End Users.
4.2.4 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.4.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory products and services.
4.2.4.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber
list information and the subscriber list information of other companies that have authorized a similar
release of their subscriber list information by AT&T-21STATE.
