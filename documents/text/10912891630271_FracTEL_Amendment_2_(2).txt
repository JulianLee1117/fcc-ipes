Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(gX3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, FracTEL, LLC hereby wishes to
submit an amendment to its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
In the original application under (D) $ 52.15(gX3XiXD), it was stated that "As proof of its
facilities readiness, FracTEL has attached to this application (1) demonstration of established
interconnect between FracTEL and its carrier partner providing PSTN connectivity for inbound
calls to FracTEL numbers . .." This amendment is to correct that sentence to, "As proof of its
facilities readiness, FracTEL has attached to this application (l) demonstration of established
interconnect between FracTEL and its carrier partner providing PSTN connectivity for both
inbound and outbound calls to and from FracTEL numbers."
For any question regarding this application, please contact Aelea Christofferson at
