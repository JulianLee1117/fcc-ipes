Re: Docket No. 21-34: In the Matter of Yodel Technologies, LLC For Authorization to Obtain

Dear Secretary Dortch:
It is our understanding that the Governance Authority no longer requires direct access to
numbers for STIR/SHAKEN implementation. Accordingly, Yodel Technologies, LLC, by its
counsel, hereby withdraws its Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources in the

Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you.
