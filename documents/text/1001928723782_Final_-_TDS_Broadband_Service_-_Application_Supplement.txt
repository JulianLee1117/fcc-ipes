Re: Request for Confidential Treatment, Supplement to
Application of TDS Broadband Service, LLC for Authority
to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section
52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to section 52.15(g) of the Commission’s rules, TDS Broadband Service, LLC
(“TDS Broadband Service”) hereby submits the enclosed supplement to its application for
authorization to obtain numbering resources and requests confidential treatment of Exhibits A-2
and A-3 contained within the supplement.1 Consistent with sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules,2 TDS Broadband Service has labeled the relevant exhibits “Confidential –
Not for Public Inspection.”
TDS Broadband Service respectfully requests confidential treatment for Exhibits A-2 and
A-3, which contain evidence of TDS Broadband Service’s compliance with its 911 obligations
under part 9 of the Commission’s rules, as well as with the provisions of the Communications
Assistance with Law Enforcement Act, 47 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq (“CALEA”). These Exhibits contain
commercially sensitive agreements between TDS Broadband Service and its 911 service provider,
as well as technologically sensitive diagrams showing how TDS Broadband Service complies with
CALEA. TDS Broadband Service therefore requests that the information in Exhibits A-2 and A-3
be withheld from public inspection pursuant to Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”) and section 0.457 of the Commission’s rules.3
1 This Request for Confidential Treatment is submitted in addition to the May 17 Request for
Confidential Treatment to cover newly submitted confidential exhibits in this supplement.
2 See 47 CFR §§ 0.457, 0.459.
3 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); see also 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2).

In support of this request, TDS Broadband Service provides the following information, as
required by sections 0.457(d)(2) and 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules.4
1. Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment
is sought.
TDS Broadband Service requests that Exhibits A-2 and A-3 be withheld from public
disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) and 47 C.F.R. § 0.457(d)(2). These Exhibits
contain proprietary and commercially sensitive information concerning TDS
Broadband Service’s commercial agreement with its 911 service provider and technical
diagrams showing how TDS Broadband Service complies with CALEA.
2. Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information
was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving rise to the
submission.
TDS Broadband Service is submitting Exhibits A-2 and A-3 with the supplement to its
application for numbering resources as proof that it complies with its 911 obligations
under part 9 of the Commission’s rules, as well as with the provisions of CALEA,
pursuant to section 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(E) of the Commission’s rules governing such
applications.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or
financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged
Exhibits A-2 and A-3 contain business confidential agreements between TDS
Broadband Service and its 911 service provider, and technical diagrams showing how
TDS Broadband Service transmits voice traffic to the PSTN in compliance with CALEA.
This information is subject to exemption from public disclosure under FOIA
Exemption 4.5 The Commission has long held that, for the purposes of Exemption 4,
“records are ‘commercial’ as long as the submitter has a commercial interest in them.”6
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that
is subject to competition
The interconnected voice over internet protocol (VoIP) market is highly competitive.
The commercial information at issue concerns TDS Broadband Service’s ability to
comply with the 911 service and CALEA obligations applicable to all VoIP service
4 See 47 CFR §§ 0.457(d)(2), 0.459.
5 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

providers, and thus “concerns a service subject to competition.”7 As such, this
information qualifies as sensitive internal business and commercial information
entitled to protection under FOIA and the Commission’s rules.8
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in
substantial competitive harm
Release of the confidential information contained in Exhibits A-2 and A-3 likely would
cause competitive harm to TDS Broadband Service. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit has stated, parties do not have to “‘show actual competitive harm’” to
justify confidential treatment; rather, “‘[a]ctual competition and the likelihood of
substantial competitive injury’ is sufficient to bring commercial information within the
realm of confidentiality.”9 The VoIP industry is highly competitive, and TDS
Broadband Service’s competitors could take advantage of the commercially sensitive
agreements and technical information contained in the Exhibits.
6. Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent
unauthorized disclosure
TDS Broadband Service treats the agreement and diagrams contained in Exhibits A-2
and A-3 respectively as confidential and proprietary. It does not publicly disclose this
information.
7. Identification of whether the information is available to the public and the
extent of any previous disclosure of the information to third parties
TDS Broadband Service has not publicly disclosed the information for which it is
seeking protection. This information is provided to TDS Broadband Service’s
commercial partners subject to confidentiality provisions in the agreements to the
extent necessary for TDS Broadband Service to comply with its 911 service and CALEA
obligations.
8. Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that
material should not be available for public disclosure
The confidential information contained in Exhibits A-2 and A-3 should never be
released for public inspection. The information is commercially sensitive and
7 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
8 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2).
9 Pub. Citizen Rsch. Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (quoting Gulf & W.
Indus. v. United States, 615 F.2d 527, 530 (D.C. Cir. 1979)).

confidential and any release would commercially disadvantage TDS Broadband
Service.
For the foregoing reasons, TDS Broadband Service respectfully requests that the
Commission keep Exhibits A-2 and A-3 within the enclosed supplement confidential and withhold
them from public inspection.
Please direct any questions regarding this request to the undersigned.
Respectfully submitted,
