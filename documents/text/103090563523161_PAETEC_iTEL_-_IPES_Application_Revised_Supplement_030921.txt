Re: Revised Supplemental filing to PAETEC iTEL, L.L.C.’s Application for
Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization
WC 20-416
Dear Ms. Dortch:
PAETEC iTEL, L.L.C. (“Windstream IPES”) submits this revised supplemental
information in connection with its above referenced Application filed on September 30, 2020.
1. Windstream IPES intends to provide interconnected VoIP service in the following
states: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, and
Wisconsin.
2. In compliance with Commission Rule Section 52.15(g)(2), in order to show its
facilities readiness, Windstream IPES has supplied confidential exhibits to the
Commission reflecting network agreements that are in place.
3. Windstream IPES’ ultimate parent company Windstream Holdings II, LLC
(“Holdings II”) holds its interest in Windstream IPES through a vertical chain of
several wholly-owned subsidiary companies that are U.S. domestic entities. On
August 28, 2020, the FCC approved the transfer of control of Holdings II, which
was simultaneously converted from a corporation to a limited liability company, in
connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. See DA 20-
985, WC Docket No. 20-151 et al. (“Emergence Order”). The Emergence Order
permitted the transfer of control to occur in two steps. At the end of Step One, which
occurred on September 21, 2020, Holdings II’s equity ownership by non-U.S.
holders is approximately 3.64%. The Emergence Order permitted Holdings II and
two of its direct investors to issue Special Warrants to foreign investors. Pursuant
to the Emergence Order, Holdings II was also required to file within 30 days of

emergence a Petition for Declaratory Ruling requesting a waiver to exceed the 25%
statutory foreign ownership benchmark, to secure specific approval for a number of
foreign entities to hold direct or indirect equity and voting interests in Holdings II,
and to have up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership. Holdings II filed the
required Petition for Declaratory Ruling on October 21, 2020, in IBFS File No. ISP-
PDR-20201021-00010, and this matter is currently pending. Step Two, the exercise
of the Special Warrants, will not be consummated until the Commission has granted
the requested Declaratory Ruling.
Should you have any questions or need additional information please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
Nicole Winters
Counsel II
