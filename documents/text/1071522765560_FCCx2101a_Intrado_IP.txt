In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules, Intra do IP
hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
lntrado IP seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
lntrado IP is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between it and its carrier partner, as proof of
lntrado IP' s facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 1S(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's
rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL,
OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which lntrado IP seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A describes the
agreement between lntrado IP and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning lntrado IP's network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to lntrado IP's disadvantage. lntrado IP has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol ("VoiP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by lntrado IP could compromise lntrado IP's position in this
highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to
lntrado IP.

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM
Competitors could use lntrado IP's proprietary commercial and operational information to
lntrado IP's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning lntrado IP's
commercial agreements, as well as information as to how lntrado IP provides its services. The
prices and terms for the provision of such services are a substantial differentiator between
competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure of the Carrier Agreements would result in significant
competitive harm to lntrado IP's carrier partner. This information is not normally disclosed to
the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
lntrado IP has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; lntrado IP is prohibited
by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreements, except as expressly authorized by
the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE
EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
lntrado IP does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or that the
Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non
disclosure agreement regarding their contents.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT
MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
lntrado IP requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. lntrado IP and
its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in effect indefinitely and therefore
any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance would cause competitive harm to
Intra do IP's carrier partner regarding of the timing of the disclosure.

planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, lntrado IP respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
