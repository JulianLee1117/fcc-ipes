RE: WC Docket No. 20-402 – Supplement to WaveNation, LLC’s Application for
Authorization to Obtain Number Resources
Dear Ms. Dortch:
WaveNation, LLC (“WaveNation”) hereby submits this Supplement to its Application for
Authorization to Obtain Number Resources (“Application”), which was filed with the Federal
Communications Commission (“Commission”) on November 23, 2020. As requested,
WaveNation hereby provides the Service Order – PSTN Control Service – Interconnected VoIP
between WaveNation and Peerless Network.
WaveNation respectively requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, the Service Order – PSTN Control Service – Interconnected VoIP in its entirety as
confidential because the document contains trade secrets and commercially sensitive “Pricing”
information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C.
§ 552(b)(4). The information in the document is “of a kind that would not customarily be
released to the public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under
FOIA. WaveNation respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information was disclosed.
