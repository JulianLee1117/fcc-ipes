This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Agreements by and between AT&T and CLEC as shown in the attached
Exhibit C.
WHEREAS, AT&T and CLEC are Parties to the Agreements as shown in the attached Exhibit C, and
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Interconnection Agreement to modify certain rates; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to amend
the Agreement as follows:
1. The Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals and the terms and conditions contained herein, and Pricing Sheets
(Exhibit A and Exhibit B), all of which are hereby incorporated by this reference and constitute a part of this Amendment.
2. Add the Pricing Sheet in Exhibit A. The rates in Exhibit A supersede the rates for the corresponding elements in the
Pricing Sheet in the Agreement.
3. To the extent CLEC is no longer purchasing commercial local transport pursuant to a separate agreement using the
USOCs and Basic Classes of Services set forth on the Pricing Sheet in Exhibit A, CLEC shall provide Notice to AT&T to
implement the rates set forth in Exhibit B. Upon verification that CLEC is no longer purchasing commercial local transport,
AT&T will implement the rates in Exhibit B. Depending on CLEC’s bill period and AT&T billing system processes, the rate
change may take up to two billing cycles to go into effect.
4. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
5. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall be

arguments it may have at law, or under the intervening law, or regulatory change provisions, in the underlying Agreement
(including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with respect to any
orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated
into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
7. This Amendment shall be filed with the applicable State Commission(s) and will become effective July 12, 2022.
