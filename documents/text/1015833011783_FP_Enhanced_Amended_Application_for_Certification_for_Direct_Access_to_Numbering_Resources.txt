II. Acknowledgements
Consolidated Long Distance hereby acknowledges that:
1 Certification of Michael Shultz (attached hereto) ¶1.

a. Authorization granted under this application is subject to compliance with
applicable Commission numbering rules, numbering authority delegated to the states, and
industry practices and guidelines regarding numbering as applicable to telecommunications
carriers; and
b. Consolidated Long Distance must file requests for numbers with the relevant state
Commissions in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont at least thirty (30) days prior to requesting
numbering from the numbering administrators.2
III. Interconnected VoIP Service Readiness
Consolidated Long Distance seeks direct access to telephone numbering resources for the
provision of interconnected Voice Over Internet Protocol (“i-VoIP”) in Maine, New Hampshire
and Vermont. Consolidated Long Distance is capable of providing service within sixty days of
the numbering resource activation date in accordance with Section 52.15(g)(2) of the
Commission’s rules3 because Consolidated Long Distance is providing i-VoIP service in those
states today. Consolidated Long Distance has been providing i-VoIP service in Maine, New
Hampshire and Vermont for more than four years.4 Consolidated Long Distance currently offers
business i-VoIP services including hosted PBX and SIP Trunking.5 These services currently are
offered using a numbering partner. If this petition is granted, Consolidated Long Distance will
continue offering the services it offers today without the need for a numbering partner.6

6 Certification of Michael Shultz ¶4. Other CCI subsidiaries currently provide interconnected
VoIP service in these states: California, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Id. ¶6.

Consolidated Long Distance will continue to provide i-VoIP service the same way it does
today: using the facilities owned by its local exchange carrier (“LEC”) affiliates, such as
Northern New England Telephone Operations LLC (serving Maine and New Hampshire) and
Telephone Operating Company of Vermont LLC (serving Vermont), through an intra-corporate
arrangement, and entering into an interconnection agreement in any local area where the
applicant does not have a LEC affiliate whose facilities it can use to provision interconnected
VoIP service. Consolidated Long Distance has such an interconnection agreement today, for
example, with TDS in New Hampshire (for portions of the state where the LEC is not a
Consolidated Long Distance affiliate).7 A copy of that agreement, which is publicly available, is
provided herewith.
Consolidated Long Distance thus is capable of providing service within sixty days of the
numbering resource activation date in accordance with Section 52.15(g)(2) of the Commission’s
rules.8
IV. Certifications
a. Consolidated Long Distance hereby certifies that it contributes to the Federal
Universal Service Fund (“USF”) and Telecommunications Relay Services Fund (“TRSF”) and
complies with its contribution obligations with respect to those funds. Additionally, Consolidated
Long Distance certifies that it complies with all contribution and administration obligations
7 Id. ¶5. The applicant, Enhanced Communications of Northern New England, Inc., which is
party to the referenced agreement with TDS, is also referred to in that agreement as
“FAIRPOINT” because Enhanced Communications of Northern New England, Inc. was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of FairPoint Communications, Inc. at the time of the agreement
(August 2015); the latter merged with and into CCI in July 2017. See Joint Application of
Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc., and FairPoint Communications, Inc., to Transfer
Indirect Control of Authorization Holders to Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc., WC
