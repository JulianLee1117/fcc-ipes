Corp.; Manhattan Telecommunications Corporation dlbla MetTel, Applicant,
For Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52. J5 (g)
oft he Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 15-_ __________
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, Manhattan
Telecommunications Corporation ("MetTel") hereby submits its application requesting
authorization to obtain numbering resources.
MetTel respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to Exhibit A-Statement to the application because that
document contains commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of
Information Act ("FOIA").1 MetTel is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that
would not customarily be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential"
under FOIA2 Moreover, MetTel would suffer competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT - NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission's rules,4
MetTel hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT Is SOUGHT5
MetTel seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION 6
MetTel is submitting a Exhibit A - Statement that describes MetTel's Proof of Facilities
Readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission's rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED7
The information for which MetTel seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors."8 Exhibit A
describes the agreement between MetTel and our Carrier Partner and how this agreement
supports Proof of Readiness. This description contains proprietary commercial information.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT Is SUBJECT TO COMPETITION9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by
competitors to MetTel's disadvantage. MetTel has numerous competitors in the Voice over
Internet Protocol ("VoIP") services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and
commercial information of the type provided by MetTel could compromise MetTel's position in
this highly competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm
to MetTel.
