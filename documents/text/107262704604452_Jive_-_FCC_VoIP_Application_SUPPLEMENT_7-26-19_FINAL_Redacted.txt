Marlene H. Dortch REQUEST FOR
Secretary CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

Re: Jive Communications, Inc. Supplement to Application for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources & Request for Confidential Treatment
WC Docket No. 19-154
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Jive Communications, Inc. (“Jive”) hereby encloses for filing a Supplement to its previously-
filed Application to Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding
Confidential Exhibit 2, an interconnection agreement between Jive and its carrier partner (“Jive
Interconnection Agreement”). The Jive Interconnection Agreement consists of the original
Master Services Agreement between the carrier partner and Jive’s predecessor-affiliate, a First
Amendment, and an Assignment and Assumption Agreement by which Jive’s affiliate assumed
the Amended Master Services Agreement on behalf of Jive and others. The Supplement and Jive
Interconnection Agreement are sent to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the
Commission’s Rules.
Jive respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to the Jive Interconnection Agreement. This document contains trade
secrets and commercial, technical and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of the
Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 Jive is voluntarily providing this trade secret and
commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover,
Jive would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Jive Interconnection Agreement were
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

3 See Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

disclosed.4 Jive treats the Jive Interconnection Agreement as private and provides it with the
understanding that the Bureau will treat it as private.5
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,6 Jive
hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT7
Jive seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit 2, an interconnection agreement
between Jive’s affiliate (on behalf of Jive) and its carrier partner (“Jive Interconnection
Agreement”).
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION8
The Jive Interconnection Agreement is being submitted to the Commission in conformity
with the referenced docket number.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED9
The information for which Jive seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors.”10 The Jive Interconnection Agreement contains trade secrets and technical
information relating to the manner in which Jive and its carrier partner conduct network
operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION11
The Jive Interconnection Agreement contains detailed information relating to operational
matters that could be used by competitors to the disadvantage of Jive. Disclosure of Jive’s
confidential information would cause substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM12
Competitors could use the information in the Jive Interconnection Agreement to Jive’s
detriment.

6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE13
Jive has made the substance of the Jive Interconnection Agreement known only to those
employees who have a need to know the subject matter, and those employees are aware of the
confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The Jive Interconnection Agreement has not
been disclosed by Jive to any non-signatories outside Jive except pursuant to appropriate
confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES14
Jive has not previously disclosed the Jive Interconnection Agreement to the public.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE15
Jive requests that the Jive Interconnection Agreement be treated as confidential for a
period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in the
Jive Interconnection Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT JIVE BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING WHETHER
ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED16
The disclosure of the name of Jive’s carrier partner could be used to the competitive
detriment of Jive.
Respectfully submitted,
