DearSecretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, HDC Alpha, LLC ("HDC Alpha") hereby
submits its application requesting authorizationto obtain numbering resources.

47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential
treatment to Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom ofInformation Act ("FOIA").l HDC
Alpha is voluntarily providing this information, "ofa kind that would not customarily be released to the
public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 • Moreover, HDC Alpha would suffer
substantial competitive harm ifthis information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLICINSPECTION."
