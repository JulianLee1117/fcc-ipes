REDACTED FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission
Washington, DC 20554
Attn: Wireline Competition Bureau
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc.; Supplemental
Information for Application of IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc. for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the Commission's Rules, WC Docket No. 21-470
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section §52.1S(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules,1 lOT Domestic Telecom, Inc. ("lOT Domestic
Telecom") hereby submits supplemental information to its Application for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources_
lOT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections §0.457 and §0.459 of the
Commission's Rules/ the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to
supplemental Exhibit A to the application because that document contains sensitive trade secrets and
commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA").3
Moreover, IDT Domestic Telecom would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION."
In support of this request, lOT Domestic Telecom hereby states the following:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS
SOUGHT.
lOT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to its Application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.
IDT Domestic Telecom is submitting as Exhibit A the agreement between its carrier partner as proof
of lOT Domestic Telecom's facilities readiness as required by Section 52. 15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission's Rules.
47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g).
47 C.F.R. § 0.457 & §0.459.
See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). Public disclosure is not required for "trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential."

3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR
CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED.
The information for which lOT Domestic Telecom seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information "which would customarily be guarded from competitors". Exhibit A
describes the agreement between lOT Domestic Telecom and its carrier partner and contains
proprietary commercial information concerning lOT Domestic Telecom's network, customers, and
services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters which can be used by other
interconnected VoiP providers to compromise lOT Domestic Telecom's position in the highly
competitive interconnected VoiP business sector. Detailed operations and commercial information
of the type provided by lOT Domestic Telecom could compromise lOT Domestic Telecom's position in
this highly competitive industry. Accordingly, release of this information would result in substantial
competitive harm to lOT Domestic Telecom.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
COMPETITIVE HARM.
Competitors could use lOT Domestic Telecom's proprietary commercial and operational information
to lOT Domestic Telecom's detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information concerning
lOT Domestic Telecom's commercial agreements, as well as information as to how lOT Domestic
Telecom provides its services. The prices and terms for the provision of such services are a
substantial differentiator between competing carriers. Therefore, disclosure of the Carrier
Agreement would result in significant competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom's carrier partner.
This information is not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.
lOT Domestic Telecom has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public; IDT Domestic
Telecom is prohibited by contract from publicly disclosing the Carrier Agreement, except as expressly
authorized by the carrier partner.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT
OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.
IDT Domestic Telecom does not believe that the Carrier Agreement is available to the public or that
the Carrier Agreement has ever been disclosed to third parties absent the protection of a non
disclosure agreement regarding their contents.

Page 3 of 3
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL
SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
IDT Domestic Telecom requests that Exhibit A be withheld from public disclosure indefinitely. IDT
Domestic Telecom and its carrier partner intend for the Carrier Agreement to remain in effect
indefinitely and therefore any disclosure of the Carrier Agreement or their substance would cause
competitive harm to IDT Domestic Telecom's carrier partner regarding of the timing of the
disclosure.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT IDT DOMESTIC TELECOM BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED.
The information concerns IDT Domestic Telecom's proprietary network information, related to
current and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
For the foregoing reasons, IDT Domestic Telecom respectfully requests the Carrier Agreement be granted
confidential status and withheld from public inspection.
Any questions you may have regarding this filing should be directed to my attention at 407-740-3006 or via
email to croesel@inteserra.com. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
