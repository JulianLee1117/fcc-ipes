\ilC-Docket No. 17-342
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. $0.459(a)(2) of the Federal Communications Commission
("Commission") rules, Advanced Telecom Solutions, LLC ("ATS") requests that the enclosed
Local Connect Ser'vices Service Schedule between ATS and Inteliquent, Inc. ("Service
Schedule') be withheld from public inspection. A redacted version ofthe Service Schedule was
submiued on the Commission's Electronic Comments Filing System on December 15, 2017,in
conjunction with ATS's Supplement to its Application for Authorizationto Obtain Number
Resources. Two confidential versions of the Service Schedule are enclosed under seal and
marked confidential.
The Service Schedule should be withheld from public inspection because it contains
commercial trade secret information from which the parties' competitors may derive economic
value. The parties derive independent economic value from the fact that the specific contractual
terms and conditions oftheir service offerings are unknown to their competitors. Disclosure of
the Service Schedule to the public would provide existing and potential competitors an unfair
and undeserved competitive advantage. This Service Schedule has not previously been disclosed
to the public.
ATS respectfully requests that the Service Schedule be withheld from public inspection
during the pendency of WC Docket No. 17-342, and returned or destroyed after the outcome of
ATS's Application has been determined.
