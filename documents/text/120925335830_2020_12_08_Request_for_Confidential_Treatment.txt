REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
Via ECFS and Federal Express
Marlene H. Dortch
Secretary
Federal Communications Commission

Annapolis Junction, MD 20701
Re: Zoom Voice Communications, Inc.’s Application for Numbering Authorization,
WC Docket No. 20-_____
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. (“Zoom Voice”) hereby encloses for filing its Application for
Numbering Authorization (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibits A and B.
Confidential Exhibit A is an interconnection agreement between Zoom Voice and its carrier
partner, and Confidential Exhibit B consists of relevant pages of an interconnection agreement
between that carrier partner and a local exchange carrier (collectively, “Interconnection
Agreements”). These documents are sent to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of
the Commission’s rules.
Zoom Voice respectfully requests that, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and § 0.459, the
Commission withhold from public inspection and accord confidential treatment to the
Interconnection Agreements. The documents contain trade secrets and commercial, technical,
and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 The information contained in the Interconnection
Agreements constitutes trade secrets and commercial and financial information, which is “of a
kind that would customarily not be released to the public.”3 In addition, Zoom Voice treats the
Interconnection Agreements as private, and provides them to the Commission with the
understanding that the Commission will likewise treat them as private.4

Under the recent Supreme Court decision in Food Marketing Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, this is
sufficient to show that the information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA. The
submitter is not required to show that the information’s disclosure is likely to cause substantial
competitive harm. Rejecting such a requirement as inconsistent with the plain text of the FOIA
statute, the Court clarified: “At least where commercial or financial information is both
customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an
assurance of privacy, the information is ‘confidential’ within the meaning of Exemption 4.”5
Nonetheless, because the Commission’s rules ostensibly necessitate a showing of substantial
competitive harm,6 Zoom Voice addresses that prong of the analysis below.
In support of this request and pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b), Zoom Voice hereby states as
follows:
1. Identification of Specific Information for Which Confidential Treatment Is
Sought (47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1))
Zoom Voice seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibits A and B. Confidential
Exhibit A is an interconnection agreement between Zoom Voice and its carrier partner, and
Confidential Exhibit B consists of relevant pages of an interconnection agreement between that
carrier partner and a local exchange carrier (collectively, “Interconnection Agreements”). These
documents contain the following header: “Confidential Treatment Requested—Not for Public
Disclosure.”
2. Description of Circumstances Giving Rise to the Submission (47 C.F.R.
§ 0.459(b)(2))
The Interconnection Agreements are being submitted to the Commission in conformity
with the rules for obtaining an authorization for numbering resources.
3. Explanation of the Degree to Which the Information Is Commercial or
Financial, or Contains a Trade Secret or Is Privileged (47 C.F.R.
§ 0.459(b)(3))
The information contained in the Interconnection Agreements relates to the manner in
which Zoom Voice, its carrier partner, and the carrier partner’s local exchange carrier conduct
network operations. This constitutes sensitive commercial, financial, and technical information
which would customarily be guarded from competitors and is “not routinely available for
public inspection.”7

4. Explanation of the Degree to Which the Information Concerns a Service that
Is Subject to Competition (47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4))
The Interconnection Agreements contain information pertaining to the provision of
interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) service. The market for VoIP service is
highly competitive.
5. Explanation of How Disclosure of the Information Could Result in
Substantial Competitive Harm (47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5))
The Interconnection Agreements contain detailed information relating to operations
matters that could be used by competitors to Zoom Voice’s detriment. Disclosure of that
information would thereby cause substantial competitive harm.8 In addition, the disclosure of
the name of Zoom Voice’s carrier partner and interconnecting local exchange carrier could be
used to Zoom Voice’s competitive detriment.
6. Identification of Any Measures Taken by the Submitting Party to Prevent
Unauthorized Disclosure (47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6))
Zoom Voice has made the substance of the Interconnection Agreements known only to
those employees who have a need to know the subject matter, and those employees are aware of
the confidential and sensitive nature of the information. Zoom Voice has not disclosed the
Interconnection Agreements to any non-signatories except pursuant to appropriate confidentiality
agreements.
7. Identification of Whether the Information Is Available to the Public and the
Extent of Any Previous Disclosure of the Information to Third Parties (47
C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7))
Zoom Voice has not previously disclosed the Interconnection Agreements to the public or
to third parties, except as pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements.
8. Justification of Period During Which the Submitting Party Asserts that
Material Should Not Be Available for Public Disclosure (47 C.F.R.
§ 0.459(b)(8))
Zoom Voice requests that the Interconnection Agreements be treated as confidential for a
period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information
therein.
