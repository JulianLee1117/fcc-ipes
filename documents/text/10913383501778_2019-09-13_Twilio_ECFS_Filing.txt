VIA HAND DELIVERY
Marlene H. Dortch REQUEST FOR
Secretary CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street, SW
Washington, DC 20554
Re: Twilio International Inc., Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering
Resources & Request for Confidential Treatment, WC Docket No. 19-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Twilio International Inc. (“Twilio”) hereby encloses for filing its Application to Obtain
Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit A, an agreement
between Twilio and its carrier partner (Confidential Exhibit A or “Carrier Agreement”) and
Confidential Exhibit B, an interconnection agreement between Twilio’s carrier partner and an
incumbent local exchange carrier (Confidential Exhibit B or “Interconnection Agreement”). The
Application, Carrier Agreement, and Interconnection Agreement are sent to you for filing
pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
Twilio respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection
Agreement. These documents contain trade secrets and commercial, technical and financial
information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does
not apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 Twilio is voluntarily providing this
trade secret and commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be
released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of
FOIA.3 Moreover, Twilio would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Carrier Agreement
was disclosed and if the identity of its carrier partner was disclosed by disclosure of the
Interconnection Agreement.4

3 See Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
4 See National Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5
Twilio hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT6
Twilio seeks confidential treatment of the Carrier Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit A, and the Interconnection Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit B.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION7
The Carrier Agreement and Interconnection Agreement are being submitted to the
Commission as proof of facilities readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED8
The information for which Twilio seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information “which would customarily be guarded from
competitors.”9 The Carrier Agreement and Interconnection Agreement contain trade secrets and
proprietary commercial and technical information relating to the manner in which Twilio and its
carrier partner conduct network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION10
The Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement provide detailed information
relating to commercial and operational matters that could be used by competitors to the
disadvantage of Twilio. Disclosure of Twilio’s confidential information would cause substantial
competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM11
Competitors could use the information in the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection
Agreement to Twilio’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive and proprietary
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b).
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).
9 47 C.F.R. § 0.457.
10 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4).
11 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5).

information about how Twilio provides services as well as about Twilio’s commercial
agreements with others that are not ordinarily disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE12
Twilio has made the substance of the Carrier Agreement and the identity of its carrier
partner as disclosed in the Interconnection Agreement known only to those employees who have
a need to know the subject matter and those employees are aware of the confidential and
sensitive nature of the information. The Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement
have not been disclosed by Twilio to any non-signatories outside Twilio except pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES13
Twilio has not previously disclosed the Carrier Agreement or the Interconnection
Agreement.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE14
Twilio requests that the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement be treated
as confidential for a period of ten years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of
the information in the Carrier Agreement and the Interconnection Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT TWILIO BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED15
Under applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by
Twilio on a confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of FOIA
shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a person
outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial
information in question clearly satisfies this test.
12 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6).
13 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7).
14 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(8).
15 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(9).
