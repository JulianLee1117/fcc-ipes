DearSecretary:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission's Rules, The Voice Application Network LLC ("The
Voice Application Network") hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain
numberingresources.
The Voice Application Network respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 ofthe
Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and
accord confidential treatment to ExhibitA to the application because that document contains sensitive
trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom of Information
Act ("FOIA").l The Voice Application Network is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that
would not customarily be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under
FOIA2 • Moreover, The Voice Application Network would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.3
Exhibit A is accordingly marked with the header "SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
NOTFOR PUBLICINSPECTION."
