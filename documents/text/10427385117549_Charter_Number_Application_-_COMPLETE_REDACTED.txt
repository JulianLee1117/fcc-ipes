REDACTED – FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION
April 27, 2023
VIA ECFS REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary
Federal Communications Commission
45 L Street NE
Washington, DC 20554
Re: Charter IP Enabled Services, LLC, Application for Authorization to Obtain
Numbering Resources & Request for Confidential Treatment
WC Docket No. 23-______
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Charter IP Enabled Services, LLC (“Charter”) encloses for filing its Application to Obtain
Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit A, an agreement
between Charter (through its affiliate, Charter Communications Operating, LLC) and its carrier
partner (Confidential Exhibit A or “Carrier Agreement”). The Application and Carrier Agreement
are sent to you for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
Charter respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to the Carrier Agreement. The document contains
trade secrets and commercial, technical and financial information that falls within Exemption 4 of
the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does
not apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 Charter is voluntarily providing this trade secret
and commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover,
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

Charter would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Carrier Agreement was disclosed and if
the identity of its carrier partner was disclosed.4
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5
Charter hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT6
Charter seeks confidential treatment of the Carrier Agreement, submitted with the
Application as Confidential Exhibit A.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION7
The Carrier Agreement is being submitted to the Commission as proof of facilities
readiness, as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED8
The information for which Charter seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial, financial, and technical information as described in Section 0.457(d) of the
Commission’s rules.9 The Carrier Agreement contains trade secrets and proprietary commercial
and technical information relating to the manner in which Charter and its carrier partner conduct
network operations.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION10
The Carrier Agreement provides detailed information relating to commercial and
operational matters that could be used by competitors to the disadvantage of Charter. Disclosure
of Charter’s confidential information would cause substantial competitive harm.
4 See National Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM11
Competitors could use the information in the Carrier Agreement to Charter’s detriment as
they would gain access to sensitive and proprietary information about how Charter provides
services as well as about Charter’s commercial agreements with others that are not ordinarily
disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE12
Charter has made the substance of the Carrier Agreement and the identity of its carrier
partner known only to those employees who have a need to know the subject matter and those
employees are aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of the information. The Carrier
Agreement has not been disclosed by Charter to any non-signatories outside Charter except
pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES13
Charter has not previously disclosed the Carrier Agreement.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE14
Charter requests that the Carrier Agreement be treated as confidential for a period of ten
years. This period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in the Carrier
Agreement.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT CHARTER BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED15
Under applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by
Charter on a confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of FOIA
11 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5).
12 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6).
13 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(7).
14 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(8).
15 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(9).

shields information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a person
outside government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial information
in question clearly satisfies this test.
