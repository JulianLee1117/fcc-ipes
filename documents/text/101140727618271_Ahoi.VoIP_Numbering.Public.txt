Attachment 1
ICC Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Amendment
Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Agreement to the contrary, the following terms and
provisions shall govern the intercarrier compensation between the Parties for the exchange of
VoIP-PSTN Traffic,
Section 4.0 - DEFINITIONS
“VoIP-PSTN Traffic” includes any traffic previously referred to in the Agreement as “VoIP” or
“VoIP Traffic” or “IP Enabled Voice Traffic”, and is defined as traffic which is exchanged
between a CenturyLink end user and the CLEC end user in Time Division Multiplexing (“TDM”)
format that originates and/or terminates in Internet Protocol (“IP”) format, as determined in the
Order, and terminates to a Party’s End User Customer.
“Local VoIP-PSTN Traffic” is VoIP-PSTN Traffic that physically originates and terminates within
the Local Calling Area as determined by the Commission.
“Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic” is VoIP-PSTN Traffic that physically originates and terminates in
different Local Calling Areas as determined by the Commission.
Section 7.0 – INTERCONNECTION
7.2 Exchange of Traffic
7.2.1.3 Local VoIP-PSTN Traffic and Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic may be exchanged
under this Agreement.
7.2.1.3.1 Switched Access Traffic, including but not limited to InterLATA Traffic,
other than Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic or Jointly Provided Switched Access Traffic, may not
be exchanged under this Agreement. In the event CLEC routes InterLATA Traffic to
CenturyLink in violation of this section, CenturyLink shall be entitled to seek injunctive
relief and to recover damages, including without limitation, compensation for such traffic
at the rate that is then applicable to such access traffic.
7.3 Intercarrier Compensation
7.3.8 Signaling Parameters: CenturyLink and CLEC are required to provide each other
the proper signaling information (e.g., originating Calling Party Number (CPN), Charge Number
(ChN) and called party number) as required by Applicable Law and further clarified by the FCC
Order to enable each Party to issue bills in a complete and timely fashion. All CCS signaling
parameters will be provided unchanged including CPN, calling party category and ChN on all
calls. All privacy indicators will be honored. Unless the FCC has approved a waiver petition
regarding specific technical restrictions, the ChN is to be passed unaltered in SS7 signaling
fields where it is different from CPN, and ChN must not be populated with a number associated
with an intermediate switch, platform, or gateway, or other number that designates anything
other than a calling party’s charge number. Where SS7 connections exist, each Party shall
pass all CCS signaling parameters, where available, on each call carried over Interconnection
trunks. If either Party fails to provide valid originating information such traffic will be billed as
Intrastate Switched Access when the calls traverse an interconnection trunk. The Parties will

coordinate and exchange data as necessary to determine the cause of the CPN/ChN failure and
to assist its correction.
7.3.9 VoIP-PSTN Traffic
7.3.9.1 Local VoIP-PSTN Traffic
7.3.9.1.1 CLEC and CenturyLink will exchange Local VoIP-PSTN Traffic on the
same basis and at the same rates as Exchange Service (EAS/Local) Traffic and such
Local VoIP-PSTN Traffic will be identified as such by using the originating and
terminating call detail information of each call unless the Parties specifically agree
otherwise. This call jurisdiction method described herein is intended by the Parties as a
proxy to determine the jurisdiction of a call, i.e. the actual geographic end points of the
call, and the Parties acknowledge that there may be some circumstances where the
actual geographic end points of a particular call may be difficult or impossible to
determine. At any time during the term of this Agreement, CLEC and CenturyLink may
agree on alternate methods to establish call jurisdiction based on regulatory or
technological evolution. The Parties agree that it is in the best interest of both Parties to
work together in an effort to continue to improve the accuracy of jurisdictional data and
such efforts shall not be reasonably withheld by either Party.
7.3.9.2 Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic
7.3.9.2.1 CLEC and CenturyLink will exchange Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic at rates
identified in each Party’s appropriate access tariff. Such Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic will be
identified as InterLATA Traffic or IntraLATA Toll Traffic by using the originating and
terminating call detail information of each call unless the Parties specifically agree
otherwise. This call jurisdiction method described herein is intended by the Parties as a
proxy to determine the jurisdiction of a call, i.e. the actual geographic end points of the
call, and the Parties acknowledge that there may be some circumstances where the
actual geographic end points of a particular call may be difficult or impossible to
determine. At any time during the term of this Agreement, CLEC and CenturyLink may
agree on alternate methods to establish call jurisdiction based on regulatory or
technological evolution. The Parties agree that it is in the best interest of both Parties to
work together in an effort to continue to improve the accuracy of jurisdictional data and
such efforts shall not be reasonably withheld by either Party.
7.3.9.2.1.1 InterLATA Traffic which is Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic will be
exchanged at each Party’s interstate access tariff rates. Any Transit Traffic
which is both interLATA and Toll VoIP-PSTN will be exchanged at each Party’s
interstate switched access service rates. InterLATA Traffic which is not Toll
VoIP-PSTN Traffic shall be subject to 7.2.1.3.1.
7.3.9.2.1.2 IntraLATA Toll Traffic which is Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic will continue
to be exchanged at each Party’s intrastate access tariff rates.
7.3.9.2.1.3 The portion of LIS facilities used for Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic
will be billed at CenturyLink’s interstate access tariff rates after the application of
Relative Use Factor. CenturyLink will use the Local Interconnection Service
Facilities Percent VoIP Usage (LIS-Facility-PVU) factor in Exhibit A to determine

the portion of Entrance Facility, Direct Trunk Transport, and MUX that shall be
deemed the portion of the facility used to carry Toll VoIP-PSTN Traffic.
7.3.9.2.1.3.1 The LIS-Facility-PVU factor shall be the percentage of
the total traffic CLEC routes to CenturyLink for termination which is Toll
VoIP-PSTN Traffic. The CLEC shall determine their Toll VoIP-PSTN
Traffic based on information such as the number of the CLEC’s retail
VoIP subscriptions in the state (e.g. as reported on FCC Form 477), traffic
studies, actual call detail, or other relevant and verifiable information
which the parties will exchange.
7.3.9.2.1.4 Any factors established by the Parties for the previous sections of
7.3.9.2 shall be based on the particular characteristics of the traffic exchanged
within the State between CLEC and CenturyLink and shall not be subject to
adoption by anyone not a Party to this Agreement, or apply to any other service
areas.

Ms. Marlene Dortch
Secretary
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street SW
Washington, DC 20554
RE: Request for Confidential Treatment to Application of Ahoi Telecom, Inc. for
Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch,
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Ahoi LLC hereby
submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
Ahoi respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection, Exhibits A and C to this application in its entirety as confidential because the
documents contain trade secrets and commercially sensitive information that falls within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The
information in Exhibits A and C is “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the
public” and therefore, this information qualifies for confidential treatment under FOIA.
Ahoi respectfully submits that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if this
information were disclosed.
Exhibit A and C are accordingly marked with “Confidential and Proprietary – Filed
Under Seal Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §0.459.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s
rules, Ahoi hereby states as follows:
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT PURSUANT TO
47 CFR § 0.459(b)(1).
Ahoi seeks confidential treatment of Confidential Exhibit A and C in their entirety.

Federal Communications Commission
January 14, 2025
Page 2 of 3
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION
PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(2).
Ahoi is submitting the confidential agreements between it and Peerless Network,
Inc., and between it and Lincoln Communications Group, LLC, as proof of Ahoi’s
facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the Commission’s
rules.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(3).
The information for which Ahoi seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors”
as defined in 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). Confidential Exhibit A consists of commercial
agreements between Ahoi and its partners of which contain proprietary information
concerning Ahoi’s network, customers, and services.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION
CONCERNS A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION PURSUANT
TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(4).
Confidential Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that
could be used by competitors to Ahoi’s disadvantage. Ahoi has numerous
competitors in the telecommunications industry in which it operates. Detailed
commercial information on operations of the type provided by Ahoi could
compromise its position in this highly competitive industry. Release of this
information would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Ahoi.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM PURSUANT TO 47 CFR
§ 0.459(b)(5).
Competitors could use Ahoi’s proprietary and commercial information to its
detriment as they would gain access to sensitive data about how Ahoi provides
services as well as about Ahoi’s commercial agreements with others in the market
that are not normally disclosed to the public.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING
PARTY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47
CFR § 0.459(b)(6).
Ahoi has not distributed the information in Confidential Exhibits A or C to the
public or any parties within Ahoi or outside Ahoi except on a need-to-know basis.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF

Federal Communications Commission
January 14, 2025
Page 3 of 3
THE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO 47 CFR §
0.459(b)(7).
Ahoi has not previously disclosed the information in Confidential Exhibits A and
C.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING
PARTY ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(8).
Ahoi requests that Confidential Exhibits A and C be treated as confidential for a period
of ten years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information
in Confidential Exhibits A and C.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT AHOI BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD
BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO 47 CFR § 0.459(b)(9).
The information concerns Ahoi’s proprietary network, related to current and planned
operations, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
If you should have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at your
convenience.
