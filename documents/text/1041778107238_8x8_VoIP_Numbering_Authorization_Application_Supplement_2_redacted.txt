WC Docket No. 20-19
Dear Ms. Dortch:
8x8, Inc. (“8x8”) hereby encloses for filing a Supplement to its previously filed Application to
Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Confidential Exhibit D, entitled
Declaration of Bryan Martin (“Declaration”). The Supplement and Declaration are sent to you
for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
8x8 respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,
47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and accord
confidential treatment to the Declaration. This document contains trade secrets and commercial,
technical and financial information that fall within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information
Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 8x8 is voluntarily providing this trade secret and
commercial and financial information “of a kind that would customarily not be released to the
public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of FOIA.3 Moreover,
8x8 would suffer substantial competitive harm if the Declaration were disclosed.4 8x8 treats the
Declaration as private and provides it with the understanding that the Bureau will treat it as
private.5

In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,6 8x8

commercial, financial, and technical information which would customarily be guarded from

4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION10
The Declaration contains detailed information relating to operational matters that could
be used by competitors to the disadvantage of 8x8. Disclosure of 8x8’s confidential information
would cause substantial competitive harm.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM11
Competitors could use the information in the Declaration to 8x8’s detriment.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT

signatories outside 8x8 except pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements.

8x8 requests that the Declaration be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This
period is necessary due to the sensitive nature of the information in the Declaration.

ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED15
The disclosure of the name of 8x8’s carrier partner could be used to the competitive
detriment of 8x8.
