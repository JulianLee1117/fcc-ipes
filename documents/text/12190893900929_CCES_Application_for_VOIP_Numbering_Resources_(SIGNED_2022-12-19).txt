industry practices and guidelines regarding numbering as applicable to telecommunications
carriers; and

b. CCES must file requests for numbers with the relevant state Commissions at least
thirty (30) days prior to requesting numbering from the numbering administrators.2
III. Interconnected VoIP Service Readiness
CCES seeks direct access to telephone numbering resources for the provision of
interconnected Voice Over Internet Protocol (“i-VOIP”) in the contiguous 45 states, excluding
Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. CCES previously acquired direct access for numbering
resources in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont on November 24, 2018.3
CCES is capable of providing service within sixty days of the numbering resource
activation date in accordance with Section 52.15(g)(2) of the Commission’s rules4 and has
provided i-VoIP service in many states since 2015 through a cloud based i-VOIP service known as
ProConnect Unified Communications to enterprise customers.5 These services currently are offered
out-of-footprint using a numbering partner. If this petition is granted, CCES will continue
offering the services it offers today without the need for a numbering partner.6
CCES will continue to provide i-VoIP service the same way it does today under an
agreement to use facilities owned by its local exchange carrier (“LEC”) affiliates. In areas where
CCES does not have an LEC affiliate whose facilities it can use to provision i-VoIP service, it
has entered into an interconnection or Local Transit agreement. CCES has such a confidential
agreement today, for example, with Inteliquent covering geographic areas where the LEC is not a
CCES affiliate.
