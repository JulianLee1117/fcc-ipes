Re: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of RCLEC, Inc.; RCLEC, Inc..,
Applicant, For Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources Pursuant to Section
52.15(g) of the Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 17-___
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, RCLEC, Inc. (“RCLEC”)
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
RCLEC respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to Exhibits A, B, and C to the application because
those documents contain sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 RCLEC is voluntarily providing this
information, “of a kind that would not customarily be released to the public”; therefore, this
information is “confidential” under FOIA2 Moreover, RCLEC would suffer substantial
competitive harm if this information were disclosed.3
Exhibits A, B, and C are accordingly marked with the header “REDACTED FOR
PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4
RCLEC hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 See Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See National Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT IS SOUGHT 5
RCLEC seeks confidential treatment of Exhibits A, B, and C to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION 6
RCLEC is submitting, as Exhibit A, the agreement between itself and its carrier partner,
and as Exhibit B, an interconnection agreement between its carrier partner and a local exchange
carrier in one of the states in which RCLEC expects to request numbers, which together provide
proof of RCLEC’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules. RCLEC is submitting, as Exhibit C, a list of those states in which RCLEC
expects to seek numbers under the authorization requested.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS COMMERCIAL OR
FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS PRIVILEGED 7
The information for which RCLEC seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive
commercial information “which would customarily be guarded from competitors.”8 Exhibit A
consists of a confidential commercial agreement between RCLEC and its carrier partner and
contains proprietary commercial information concerning RCLEC’s network, customers, and
services. Exhibit B discloses the identity of RCLEC’s carrier partner as well as one of the states
in which RCLEC expects to seek numbers; Exhibit C consists of a list of states in which RCLEC
expects to seek numbers under the authorization requested. Both Exhibits B and C reflect
competitively sensitive, confidential commercial information about RCLEC’s commercial and
deployment planning.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS A SERVICE
THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION 9
Exhibits A, B, and C contain information relating to commercial matters that could be
used by competitors to RCLEC’s disadvantage. The Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”)
services sector is highly competitive. Detailed operations and commercial information of the
type provided by RCLEC could compromise RCLEC’s position in this highly competitive
industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to RCLEC.
5 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(1).
6 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(2).
7 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(3).
8 47 C.F.R. § 0.457(d)(2).
9 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(4).

5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM 10
Competitors could use RCLEC’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
RCLEC’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how RCLEC
provides services, about RCLEC’s commercial agreements with others in the market that are not
normally disclosed to the public, and about RCLEC’s commercial and deployment plans.
6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY TO PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE 11
RCLEC has not distributed the information in Exhibits A, B, or C to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES 12
RCLEC has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibits A, B, or C.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY ASSERTS
THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE 13
RCLEC requests that Exhibits A, B, and C be treated as confidential for a period of ten
years. This period is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in the enclosed
proposal.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT RCLEC BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN ASSESSING
WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE GRANTED 14
The information concerns RCLEC’s proprietary network information, related to current
and planned commercial and operational information, and as such, is commercially sensitive.
10 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(5).
11 47 C.F.R. § 0.459(b)(6).
