“Commission”), submits this Supplement (“Supplement”) to its previously filed application
requesting authority to directly obtain numbering resources from the North American Numbering

requested.3 Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i), with this Supplement, BTS offers the following
clarifications to its Application:
A. BTS clarifies the ownership of its structure. BTS holds a Section 214 application for
individual switched access service, granted on December 20, 1996.4 BTS is a Florida
corporation owned in equal shares by entities controlled by Rafael Olloqui and Ricardo
Olloqui. This Supplement clarifies that both Rafael and Ricardo Olloqui are United
States citizens. Rafael Olloqui became a U.S. citizen on April 12, 2019 and Ricardo
Olloqui became a U.S. citizen on May 18, 2020. At this time, the Company is now fully
held by U.S. citizens, alleviating any international ownership concerns in granting this
Application. Key management personnel are identified in Attachment 3 to the
Application.5
B. BTS has an operating agreement (the “Agreement”) with a carrier partner in the United
States, Peerless Network, Inc., that provides BTS with public switched telephone network
(“PSTN”) access through that partner entity’s approved interconnection agreements
(“ICAs”) with the relevant local exchange carriers, as submitted in the Application.6
BTS provided a copy of the Agreement in its original Application (as Attachment 2 to the
Application). BTS’s carrier partner maintains ICAs with ILECs in Florida and
throughout the country. At the Bureau’s request, BTS provides at Attachment 1 to this
Supplement a copy of the state of Florida’s approval of the Peerless’s ICA with ILECs,

which also was submitted in several recently approved applications for numbering
authority, including Assurance Telecom, LLC.7
Upon grant of this authority, BTS intends to amend its interconnection agreement with its
partner to provide the critical resources needed for efficient porting of numbers.
C. BTS clarifies that it has the ability to both originate and terminate service through
Peerless. In addition to the services previously described, BTS has requested VoIP
Control Service from Peerless, the same service relied upon Stratus Networks in its
approved application.8 BTS additionally has an existing master service agreement
(“MSA”) with Peerless, and can add other Service Orders as needed. Thus, if necessary,
BTS can obtain additional services within 60 days of approval of its request.9 As
mentioned in its Application, BTS initially seeks access to numbers only in the state of
Florida.

LLC), DA 20-152, WC Docket No. 19-335 (rel. Feb. 13, 2020). Assurance submitted a Peerless
