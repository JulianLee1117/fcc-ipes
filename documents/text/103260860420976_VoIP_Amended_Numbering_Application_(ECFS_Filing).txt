§ 64.604(c)(5)(iii) and further attests that it is 100% owned and controlled by US citizens.
In accordance with IPtelX’s Request for Confidential Treatment filed with the Commission on
February 14, 2018, it maintains and respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection,
Exhibit B of the application in its entirety as confidential and hereby incorporates its original request as if
fully restated herein. For clarification, Exhibit B is hereby unchanged from its original filing.
