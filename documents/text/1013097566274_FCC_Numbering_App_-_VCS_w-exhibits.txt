charges and/or surcharges or through modification of existing rate elements which are used to determine rates and/or charges.
Customer is liable for payment on any rate changes past the effective date as documented in a delivered rate modification
notice. Unless explicitly stated, any pricing not covered in this Service Order is subject to the Applicable Tariffs covering such
services. In addition, Peerless will not act as a billing intermediary or clearinghouse for Customer’s billing.
4.2 Peerless may charge applicable tandem switched access rates to a third party for originating and/or terminating traffic
to the Customer. If Peerless is charged by a third party for services typically billed to the end office provider (Customer),
Peerless will pass through such charges to Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Peerless is not responsible for
any charges levied by any third party in connection with such traffic that does not traverse Peerless’ network, including
intercarrier compensation.

scope arrangements, or intraMTA traffic terminating to a wireless carrier. A Mandatory Local Calling Scope arrangement is an
arrangement that provides End-Users a local calling scope, i.e. Extended Area Service (EAS), beyond their basic exchange
serving area. Local Traffic does not include optional local calling scopes, i.e. optional rate packages that permit the End-User
to choose a local calling scope beyond their basic exchange serving area for an additional fee, referred to hereafter as "optional
EAS”. Customer will route special services calls, including, but not limited to 311, 411, 611, 976, 500, 700, 900, and 911 calls,
via another local exchange carrier or service provider. The service includes only local calling or 1+ calling to the Interexchange
Carrier chosen by the customer for Long Distance Services, or toll free calling.
4.4 Should the Customer provide Peerless proper notice of cancellation of this Service Order, Customer will use best
efforts to migrate the traffic off of the Peerless network within thirty (30) days, but in no way should Company take more than
sixty (60) days to finalize such migration. Customer is responsible for payment of all traffic until traffic is properly migrated off
of Peerless’ network.
4.5 Acceptable Use. Parties agree to work cooperatively to address unlawful use in a timely manner. Peerless works
cooperatively with the industry, law enforcement, governmental entities, regulatory entities, and other carriers (collectively
“Cooperative Parties”), to address issues related to illegality, fraud and abuse. In accordance with laws applicable to Peerless
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Peerless may disclose Customer’s information and such
disclosure will not be a violation of this Agreement.
Unlawful Use. Customer will use best efforts to prevent unauthorized, illegal, or fraudulent use of the Services, and shall
terminate any unauthorized, illegal, or fraudulent user access and immediately notify Peerless of any such unauthorized, illegal,
or fraudulent use, attempted use of, or access to, the Services. Regardless of how Customer becomes aware of unlawful
activity, Customer is not relieved of liability related to the offending traffic and will also be responsible for paying third-party
fees directly related to the offending traffic. Further, any unauthorized, illegal, or fraudulent use or misuse of the Services by
or through Customer voids all warranties, express or implied, by Peerless, and relieves Peerless from any responsibility for
performance under the respective Service Order where fraud, abuse or illegality occurred. Peerless has no obligation to
prevent, monitor, notify, or actively seek facts or circumstances indicating any fraud, abuse or illegal activities.
Traceback Efforts. Customer warrants that it will participate in any traceback efforts authorized by US Telecom’s Traceback
Group regarding suspicious robocalls without the need for a subpoena or formal demand. Customer agrees that its response
shall indicate if it is in the call path as the originating provider of the calls (i.e., Customer received the calls from Customer’s
End User) or (ii) a transit provider (i.e., Customer received the calls from another voice provider). The response shall also
identify the source of the calls.
Penalties. In addition to penalties outlined above, Peerless may, in its sole discretion, take any or all of the following actions
to address if it discovers or reasonably suspects any abuse or unlawful activity: (i) take commercially reasonable action on
offending numbers in order to minimize misuse; (ii) issue a verbal, e-mail or written warning notifying the Customer of the
misuse and the corrective action that must be taken; (iii) suspend, with or without warning, all or part of a Customer’s Service
and may condition restoration of such Service upon Customer affecting corrective action; and/or (iv) terminate, with or without
warning, all or part of Customer’s service and may terminate Customer’s Agreement. Any unauthorized, illegal, or fraudulent
use or misuse of the Services by or through Customer voids all warranties, express or implied, by Peerless, and relieves Peerless
from any responsibility for performance under the respective Service Order where fraud, abuse or illegality occurred.

ARTICLE III
INTERCONNECTION PURSUANT TO SECTION 251(c)(2)
III.1 Scope. Article III describes the physical architecture for Interconnection of the Parties’
facilities and equipment for the transmission and routing of Telephone Exchange Service traffic and
Exchange Access traffic between the respective Customers of the Parties pursuant to Section 251(c)(2)
3
Page 14 of 354

of the Act; provided, however, Interconnection may not be used solely for the purpose of originating a
Party’s own interexchange traffic. Articles IV and V prescribe the specific physical facilities and Logical
Trunk Groups (and traffic routing parameters) which will be configured over the physical Interconnections
described in this Article III related to the transmission and routing of Telephone Exchange Service traffic
and Exchange Access traffic, respectively. Other trunk groups, as described in this Agreement, may be
configured using this architecture. Except with respect to Transit Service, neither Party shall use its facilities
and equipment established pursuant to this Agreement to originate and/or transmit and route CMRS traffic.
III.2 Interconnection Points and Methods, and Interconnection Activation Dates.
III.2.1 In each LATA identified on Schedule 2.1, Requesting Carrier and Ameritech shall
Interconnect their networks at the correspondingly identified Ameritech and Requesting Carrier Central
Office(s) on Schedule 2.1 for the transmission and routing within that LATA of Telephone Exchange
Service traffic and Exchange Access traffic pursuant to Section 251(c)(2) of the Act. Requesting Carrier’s
point of Interconnection must be in an Ameritech local service area in the LATA in which Requesting
Carrier is providing service. An Interconnection Activation Date not established and set forth on Schedule
2.1 as of the Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
3.4.3.
III.2.2 Interconnection in each LATA shall be accomplished at any technically feasible
point within the Parties’ networks through either (i) Collocation in Ameritech’s Central Offices as provided
in Article XII or (ii) any other Interconnection method to which the Parties may agree in advance of the
applicable Interconnection Activation Date for a given LATA and which is consistent with the Act, including
a Fiber-Meet as provided in Section 3.3.
III.2.3 If Requesting Carrier elects Collocation as an Interconnection method, or elects
a network architecture that requires Ameritech to Interconnect with Requesting Carrier’s facilities via
Collocation, then Requesting Carrier must not less than one hundred twenty five (125) days prior to its
applicable Interconnection Activation Date notify Ameritech whether Requesting Carrier wishes Ameritech
to Interconnect pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) below.
(a) Requesting Carrier shall (i) provide the transport (whether through leased or owned
facilities) of Ameritech’s traffic from the point of Interconnection to Requesting
Carrier’s Central Office, (ii) not charge Ameritech for such transport and (iii)
provide Ameritech with capacity to meet Ameritech’s forecasted needs. If
Requesting Carrier does provide Ameritech transport as provided in this
subsection (a) but then either requests Ameritech to utilize its own facilities or
does not provide Ameritech capacity to meet Ameritech’s forecasted needs, then
Requesting Carrier shall (x) provide Ameritech not less than two hundred (200)
days’ notice prior to the date Ameritech must provide its own facilities for new
trunks, (y) compensate Ameritech for the costs incurred by Ameritech to rearrange
4
Page 15 of 354

its network and (z) provide Ameritech Collocation as provided in subsection (b)
below.
(b) If Requesting Carrier does not elect to provide Ameritech transport as provided
in subsection (a) above, then Requesting Carrier shall provide to Ameritech
Collocation in Requesting Carrier’s Central Office(s) for purposes of that
Interconnection on a nondiscriminatory basis and on rates, terms and conditions
that are no less favorable than (i) Ameritech provides to Requesting Carrier
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) Requesting Carrier
provides to other similarly situated Telecommunications Carriers.
III.2.4 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Parties shall designate the Central
Office Requesting Carrier has identified as its initial Routing Point in the LATA as the Requesting Carrier
Interconnection Central Office (“RICO”) in that LATA and shall designate the Ameritech Tandem Central
Office that is designated as the home Tandem (based on the LERG) for the Ameritech Wire Center in which
the Requesting Carrier’s Central Office is located, as the Ameritech Interconnection Central Office
(“AICO”) in that LATA.
III.2.5 Requesting Carrier’s point of Interconnection must be within an Ameritech Wire
Center in the LATA in which Requesting Carrier provides service.
III.2.6 Requesting Carrier shall order all trunks and facilities used to establish
Interconnection, trunking (for both the Local/IntraLATA Trunks and Access Toll Connecting Trunks),
signaling and 9-1-1 Service (as described in Section 3.9) by submitting to Ameritech an electronic Access
Service Request including BDS Telis and, as soon as available, an electronic service order via the
Provisioning EI.
III.3 Fiber-Meet.
III.3.1 If the Parties Interconnect their networks pursuant to a Fiber-Meet, the Parties
shall jointly engineer and operate a single Synchronous Optical Network (“SONET”) transmission system.
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, this SONET transmission system shall be configured as illustrated in
Exhibit A, and engineered, installed, and maintained as described in this Article III and in the Plan (as
defined in Section 18.2). Each Party agrees to disable the Digital Control Channel (“DCC”) in its
equipment that is part of the SONET system and each Party shall be responsible for the monitoring of its
own node(s).
III.3.2 Ameritech shall, wholly at its own expense, procure, install and maintain Optical
Line Terminating Multiplexor (“OLTM”) equipment in the AICO identified for each LATA set forth on
Schedule 2.1 in capacity sufficient to provision and maintain all Logical Trunk Groups prescribed by
Articles IV and V.
5
Page 16 of 354

III.3.3 Requesting Carrier shall, wholly at its own expense, procure, install and maintain
the OLTM equipment in the RICO identified for that LATA in Schedule 2.1, in capacity sufficient to
provision and maintain all Logical Trunk Groups prescribed by Articles IV and V.
III.3.4 Ameritech shall designate a manhole (meet point manhole) immediately outside the
AICO that will be accessible via Ameritech structure leasing at the closest manhole (Fiber-Meet entry point)
or suitable entry point available via Ameritech connecting structure where the possibility of manhole cave-in
or manhole accessibility does not present a problem, and shall make all necessary preparations to receive,
and to allow and enable Requesting Carrier to deliver fiber optic facilities into that manhole or suitable entry
point with sufficient spare length to reach the OLTM equipment in the AICO. Requesting Carrier shall
deliver and maintain such strands wholly at its own expense. Upon verbal request by Requesting Carrier
to Ameritech, Ameritech will allow Requesting Carrier access to the Fiber-Meet entry point for maintenance
purposes as promptly as possible after Ameritech’s receipt of such request.
III.3.5 Requesting Carrier shall designate a manhole or other suitable entry-way
immediately outside the RICO as a Fiber-Meet entry point, and shall make all necessary preparations to
receive, and to allow and enable Ameritech to deliver, fiber optic facilities into that manhole with sufficient
spare length to reach the OLTM equipment in the RICO. Ameritech shall deliver and maintain such strands
wholly at its own expense. Upon verbal request by Ameritech to Requesting Carrier, Requesting Carrier
will allow Ameritech access to the Fiber-Meet entry point for maintenance purposes as promptly as
possible after Requesting Carrier’s receipt of such request.
III.3.6 Requesting Carrier shall pull the fiber optic strands from the Requesting Carrier-
designated manhole/entry-way into the RICO and through appropriate internal conduits Requesting Carrier
utilizes for fiber optic facilities, and shall connect the Ameritech strands to the OLTM equipment Requesting
Carrier has installed in the RICO.
III.3.7 Ameritech shall pull the fiber optic strands from the Ameritech-designated
manhole/entry-way into the AICO and through appropriate internal conduits Ameritech utilizes for fiber
optic facilities and shall connect the Requesting Carrier strands to the OLTM equipment Ameritech has
installed in the AICO.
III.3.8 Each Party shall use its best efforts to ensure that fiber received from the other
Party will enter that Party’s Central Office through a point separate from that through which such Party’s
own fiber exited.
III.3.9 For Fiber-Meet arrangements, each Party will be responsible for (i) providing its
own portion of the transport facilities to the Fiber-Meet in accordance with the Implementation Plan and
(ii) the cost to build-out its portion of the facilities to such Fiber-Meet.
III.3.10 Each Party shall provide its own, unique source for the synchronized timing of its
OLTM equipment. Each timing source must be Stratum-1 traceable and cannot be provided over
6
Page 17 of 354

DS0/DS1 facilities, via Line Timing; or via a Derived DS1 off of OLTM equipment. Both Parties agree to
establish separate and distinct timing sources which are not derived from the other, and meet the criteria
identified above.
III.4 Additional Interconnection(s).
III.4.1 If Requesting Carrier determines to offer Telephone Exchange Service within
Ameritech’s service areas that require additional points of Interconnection, Requesting Carrier shall provide
written notice to Ameritech of its need to establish such additional points of Interconnection pursuant to this
Agreement.
III.4.2 The notice provided in Section 3.4.1 shall include (i) Requesting Carrier’s
requested RICO(s) and AICO(s) (including address and CLLI Code); (ii) Requesting Carrier’s requested
Interconnection Activation Date; and (iii) a non-binding forecast of Requesting Carrier’s trunking and
facilities requirements.
III.4.3 Within ten (10) Business Days of Ameritech’s receipt of Requesting Carrier’s
notice specified in Section 3.4.1, Ameritech and Requesting Carrier shall schedule a meeting to mutually
agree on the network architecture (including trunking), the AICO(s), the RICO(s) and Interconnection
Activation Date(s) applicable to such Interconnection(s). The Interconnection Activation Date for an
Interconnection shall be established based on then-existing force and load, the scope and complexity of the
requested Interconnection and other relevant factors. The Parties acknowledge that, as of the Effective
Date, the interval to establish Interconnection via Collocation or Fiber-Meet is one-hundred fifty (150)
calendar days for up to 24 T1’s of trunking after the Parties have agreed on the AICO(s), RICO(s) and
network architecture and Requesting Carrier has furnished Ameritech a non-binding forecast in accordance
with Section 3.4.2. The interval to establish Interconnection for trunking in excess of 24T1’s is 6 T1’s per
business day after 150 days
III.5 Additional Switches.
III.5.1 If Requesting Carrier deploys additional switches in a LATA after the Effective
Date or otherwise wishes to establish Interconnection with additional Ameritech Central Offices in such
LATA, Requesting Carrier shall provide written notice thereof to Ameritech, consistent with the notice
provisions of Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, to establish such Interconnection. The terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall apply to such Interconnection, including the provisions set forth in Section 3.4.3. If
Ameritech deploys additional switches in a LATA after the Effective Date or otherwise wishes to establish
Interconnection with additional Requesting Carrier Central Offices in such LATA, Ameritech shall be
entitled, upon written notice thereof to Requesting Carrier, to establish such Interconnection and the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to such Interconnection. If either Party establishes an
additional Tandem Switch in a given LATA, the Parties shall jointly determine the requirements regarding
the establishment and maintenance of separate physical facilities and Logical Trunk Group connections and
7
Page 18 of 354

the sub-tending arrangements relating to Tandem Switches and End Offices which serve the other Party’s
Customers within the Exchange Areas served by such Tandem Switches.
III.5.2 If a Party requests the other Party to install new trunks or rearrange existing trunks
as a result of the installation of a new Switch, such Party shall provide written notice of such request and
the intervals described in Section 3.4.3 shall apply.
III.6 Nondiscriminatory Interconnection. Interconnection shall be equal in quality to that
provided by the Parties to themselves or any subsidiary, Affiliate or other person. For purposes of this
Section 3.6, “equal in quality” means the same technical criteria and service standards that a Party uses
within its own network.
III.7 Network Management.
III.7.1 Requesting Carrier and Ameritech shall work cooperatively to install and maintain
a reliable network. Requesting Carrier and Ameritech shall exchange appropriate information (e.g.,
maintenance contact numbers, network information, information required to comply with law enforcement
and other security agencies of the government and such other information as the Parties shall mutually agree)
to achieve this desired reliability.
III.7.2 Requesting Carrier and Ameritech shall work cooperatively to apply sound
network management principles by invoking network management controls to alleviate or to prevent

to as “Direct” in Item I of the Pricing Schedule) or (ii) providing demuxed DSO
level trunks at designated Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective Router(s) (channel
conditioning referred to as “Back to Back” in Item I of the Pricing Schedule) or
(iii) providing muxed DSO level trunks at a Collocation point within each
Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective Router(s) (channel conditioning referred to as
“Collocation” in Item I of the Pricing Schedule). With any of the foregoing three
(3) options, Requesting Carrier shall provide a minimum of two (2) dedicated
channels from the point of interconnection to the Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective
Router(s). Each of the foregoing options described in this subsection (a) also
require each of the Parties to provide sufficient trunking and facilities to route
Requesting Carrier’s originating 9-1-1 calls to the designated primary PSAP or to
designated alternate PSAPs. Ameritech and the Requesting Carrier will coordinate
the provision of transport capacity sufficient to route originating 9-1-1 calls from
the Requesting Carrier’s point of interconnection to the designated Ameritech 9-1-
1 Selective Router(s). In addition to the channel conditioning charges identified in
Item I of the Pricing Schedule, if Requesting Carrier leases facilities from
Ameritech, standard tariff rates shall apply.
(b) If Requesting Carrier forwards the ANI information of the calling party to the
Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective Router and the Requesting Carrier has followed the
appropriate procedures in subsection (e) to establish the record for the calling
Party in the ALI database, Ameritech will forward that calling number and the
associated street address to the PSAP for display. If no ANI is forwarded by
Requesting Carrier, Ameritech will display a Central Office identification code for
display at the PSAP.
(c) If Requesting Carrier requests facilities-routed diversity for 9-1-1 interconnection,
Ameritech shall provide such diversity to Requesting Carrier and Requesting
Carrier shall pay charges for Diverse Routes at tariffed DS1 rates. Requesting
Carrier will be responsible for determining the proper quantity of trunks and
facilities from its switches to the Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective Router(s). Ameritech
shall provide, upon request, a Trunk Design Guide which will be used to determine
the number of trunk groups required to provide 9-1-1 Service within each Rate
Center. Trunks between the Requesting Carrier’s Switch and the Ameritech 9-1-1
Selective Router shall be provisioned by Ameritech at intervals to be agreed upon
by the Parties. Following such provision and prior to the application of live traffic,
Requesting Carrier and Ameritech will cooperate to promptly test all trunks and
facilities between Requesting Carrier’s network and the Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective
Router to assure proper functioning of the 9-1-1 Service; provided, that
Requesting Carrier shall be solely responsible to provide test records and conduct
call-through testing on all new 9-1-1 trunk groups and NPA/NXXs. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the 9-1-1 trunk groups will be initially

established as a one-way CAMA MF trunk group. Where SS7 connectivity is
available and required by the applicable municipality, the Parties agree to
implement CCIS trunking.
(d) Ameritech will provide to Requesting Carrier, in mechanized format, an address
and routing file (ARF) that provides the information required for Requesting Carrier
Customer 9-1-1 record processing and delivery of calls to the appropriate
Ameritech 9-1-1 Selective Router(s). After Requesting Carrier’s initial request for
the ARF, Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier an updated ARF on a
monthly basis. At the request of Requesting Carrier, Ameritech will provide the
ARF by NPA or metro area. A specified charge as set forth at Item I of the
Pricing Schedule will apply per request.
(e) Ameritech will coordinate access to the Ameritech 9-1-1 Automatic Location
Identification (“ALI”) database for the initial loading and updating of Requesting
Carrier Customer information. Access coordination will include:
(1) Requesting Carrier to supply an electronic version of Customer telephone
numbers, addresses and other information both for the initial load and,
where applicable, daily updates. Ameritech shall confirm receipt of this
data as described in Section 3.9.2(f);
(2) Notification of error(s) involving entry and update activity;
(3) Provisioning of specific 9-1-1 routing information on each Requesting
Carrier Customer’s access line; and
(4) Providing Requesting Carrier with reference data required to ensure that
Requesting Carrier’s Customer will be routed to the correct 9-1-1
Selective Router when originating a 9-1-1 call.
If Requesting Carrier is unable to initially provide Ameritech electronic updates to
the Ameritech 9-1-1 ALI database as provided in subsection (e)(1) above, the
Parties shall negotiate the date by which Requesting Carrier shall establish such
electronic functionality and the rates, terms and conditions under which Ameritech
would update such database from paper records prior to the date Requesting
Carrier is able to furnish such updates electronically to Ameritech; and
(f) Requesting Carrier or its third party agent will provide ALI data to Ameritech for
use in entering the data into the 9-1-1 database. The initial ALI data will be
provided to Ameritech in a format prescribed by Ameritech. Requesting Carrier
shall include its company identification, as registered with NENA, on all records
10

provided to Ameritech. Requesting Carrier is responsible for providing Ameritech
updates to the ALI data and error corrections that may occur during the entry of
ALI data to the Ameritech 9-1-1 Database System. Requesting Carrier shall
reimburse Ameritech for any additional database charges incurred by Ameritech
for errors in ALI data updates caused by Requesting Carrier or its third-party
agent. Ameritech will confirm receipt of such data and corrections by the next
Business Day (where electronic transfer is available) by providing Requesting
Carrier with a report in the manner provided in the Implementation Plan of the
number of items sent, the number of items entered correctly, and the number of
errors.
(g) The services offered in this Agreement and the charges set forth at Item I of the
Pricing Schedule are based on each NXX residing in a single 9-1-1 Selective
Router. Requesting Carrier may request that an NXX shall reside in more than one
9-1-1 Selective Router; provided that Requesting Carrier shall pay Ameritech a
one-time charge as set forth at Item I of the Pricing Schedule per trunk group that
is connected to each alternate 9-1-1 Selective Router (the “9-1-1 Selective
Router Software Enhancement Connection Charge”).
(h) In the event an Ameritech or Requesting Carrier 9-1-1 trunk group fails, the Party
that originates the trunk group will notify, on a priority basis, the other Party of such
failure, which notification shall occur within two (2) hours of the occurrence or
sooner if required under Applicable Law. The Parties will exchange a list
containing the names and telephone numbers of the support center personnel
responsible for maintaining the 9-1-1 Service between the Parties.
(i) Ameritech will provide Requesting Carrier all order number(s) and circuit
identification code(s) in advance of the service due date.

ARTICLE IV
TRANSMISSION AND ROUTING OF TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
SERVICE TRAFFIC PURSUANT TO SECTION 251(c)(2)
IV.1 Scope of Traffic. Article IV prescribes parameters for the facilities and trunk groups to
be effected over the Interconnections specified in Article III for the transmission and routing of Local
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic between the Parties’ respective Telephone Exchange Service Customers
(the “Local/IntraLATA Trunks”).
12
Page 23 of 354

IV.2 Limitations. No Party shall terminate Exchange Access traffic or originate untranslated 800
traffic over the Local/IntraLATA Trunks.
IV.3 Trunk Group Architecture and Traffic Routing. The Parties shall jointly engineer and
configure Local/IntraLATA Trunks over the physical Interconnection arrangements as follows:
IV.3.1 Each Party shall initially configure a one (1)-way trunk group or, upon mutual
agreement of the Parties, a two (2) way trunk group, as a direct transmission path between each RICO and
AICO. If two (2) way trunk groups are established, each Party shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%)
of the transport between the points of Interconnection.
IV.3.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IV, if the traffic
volumes originated by a Party between any two (2) Central Office Switches at any time exceeds the CCS
busy hour equivalent of one (1) DS1, that Party shall, within sixty (60) days after such occurrence, establish
new direct trunk groups to the applicable End Office(s). As traffic volumes increase, the Parties shall add
additional direct trunk groups (24 DS0s) between any two (2) Central Offices for every increment of traffic
that equals or exceeds the CCS busy hour equivalent of one (1) DS1. At no time shall the traffic between
two (2) Central Offices, routed via Ameritech’s Tandem Switch, exceed 500 busy hour CCS.
IV.3.3 Only those valid NXX codes served by an End Office may be accessed through
a direct connection to that End Office.
IV.3.4 Each Party shall ensure that each Tandem connection permits the completion of
traffic to all End Offices which sub-tend that Tandem as identified in the Local Exchange Routing Guide
(“LERG”). To the extent that a Party desires the ubiquitous delivery of traffic within an Exchange Area,
each Party shall establish and maintain Logical Trunk Groups and separate physical facilities for such
Logical Trunk Groups connected to each Tandem of the other Party which serves, or is sub-tended by End
Offices which serve, such other Party’s Customers within the Exchange Areas served by such Tandem
Switches. Requesting Carrier shall either provide Logical Trunk Groups and such facilities for Logical
Trunk Groups or purchase Logical Trunk Groups and such facilities for Logical Trunk Groups from
Ameritech at the rates for Switched Access set forth in Ameritech’s access tariffs. If a Central Office
Switch provides both Tandem and End Office functionality, Interconnection by a Party at such Central
Office Switch shall provide access to Tandem and End Office functionality. A Party’s NXX must home
on the Tandem Switch that is in the same state as the specified NXX Rate Center.
IV.3.5 Ameritech will provide unassigned NXX codes to the Requesting Carrier, under
the Inter-Carrier Compatibility Forum (“ICCF”) developed by CO-Code Assignment Guidelines, until this
function is performed by a third party agency.
IV.3.6 Ameritech will assign a Common Language Location Identifier (“CLLI”) code to
the Requesting Carrier’s End Office Switch if so requested, to be integrated into the public network
13
Page 24 of 354

consistent with procedures used for CLLI code assignment to Ameritech’s own switches until this function
is performed by a third party agency. The code must be listed in the LERG.
IV.3.7 Each Party is responsible for administering its assigned NXX numbers.
IV.3.8 Each Party is responsible for obtaining a LERG listing of CLLI codes assigned to
its switches.
IV.3.9 If a pre-existing trunk group is unable to, or consistent with standard trunk
engineering practices, is forecasted to be unable to support additional traffic loads, each Party shall, upon
request of the other Party, provision, within thirty (30) days of such request, additional trunks to expand
the capacity of such pre-existing trunk group, subject to Section 19.12 and the availability of sufficient
capacity. If sufficient capacity does not exist, the Parties shall mutually agree on the appropriate interval
to establish such additional trunks based on force and load and other applicable criteria.
IV.3.10 If a Tandem through which the Parties are Interconnected is unable to, or is
forecasted to be unable to, support additional traffic loads for any Busy Season, the Parties will mutually
agree on an End Office trunking plan that will alleviate the Tandem capacity shortage and ensure completion
of traffic between Requesting Carrier and Ameritech Customers. For purposes of this Agreement, “Busy
Season” means any three (3) consecutive month period.
IV.3.11 If a Party determines that a trunk group is no longer necessary given actual and
forecasted traffic, that Party shall disconnect that trunk group within thirty (30) days after such
determination.
4.3.12 Pursuant to the Arbitration Decision, if Requesting Carrier uses an NXX Code to
provide foreign exchange service to its Customers outside of the geographic area assigned to such NXX
Code, Requesting Carrier shall not be required to provide a point of interconnection (POI) within 15 miles
of the rating point to which the NXX Code is assigned, at which Ameritech may terminate local traffic
destined for that NXX Code.1/
IV.4 Signaling.
IV.4.1 Where available, Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS) signaling shall be
used by the Parties to set up calls between the Parties’ Telephone Exchange Service networks. Each Party
shall supply Calling Party Number (CPN) (NPA/NXX assigned to its local exchange switch) within the SS7
signaling message. If CCIS is unavailable, Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling shall be used by the Parties.
2/
By entering into this Agreement, Ameritech is not voluntarily agreeing to waive this requirement. Moreover, Ameritech
reserves its rights to appeal or otherwise seek review of the Arbitration Decision.
14
Page 25 of 354

IV.4.2 Each Party is responsible for requesting Interconnection to the other Party’s CCIS
network, where SS7 signaling on the trunk group(s) is desired. Each Party shall connect to a pair of access
STPs that serve each LATA where traffic will be exchanged using a direct connection to the STPs serving
the desired LATA, through the designated Ameritech state gateway STP or through a third party provider
which is connected to the other Party’s signaling network. The Parties shall establish Interconnection at the
STP. The rate for signaling links to establish such Interconnection is as provided in Ameritech’s access
tariff(s). If the Requesting Carrier does not possess STPs, Requesting Carrier may purchase access to
Ameritech’s SS7 Network as provided in Ameritech’s access tariff(s).
IV.4.3 The Parties will cooperate on the exchange of Transactional Capabilities
Application Part (TCAP) messages to facilitate interoperability of CCIS-based features between their
respective networks, including all CLASS features and functions, to the extent each Party offers such
features and functions to its Customers. All CCIS signaling parameters will be provided, including Calling
Party Number (CPN), Originating Line Information (OLI), calling party category and charge number. For
terminating Exchange Access and Transit Service traffic, such information shall be passed by a Party to the
extent that such information is provided to such Party.
IV.4.4 Where available and upon the request of the other Party, each Party shall
cooperate to ensure that its trunk groups are configured utilizing the B8ZS ESF protocol for 64 Kbps clear
channel transmission to allow for ISDN interoperability between the Parties’ respective networks.
IV.5 Grades of Service. The Parties shall initially engineer and shall jointly monitor and enhance
all trunk groups consistent with the Plan.
IV.6 Measurement and Billing.
IV.6.1 For billing purposes, each Party shall pass CPN associated with that Party’s
originating switch on calls that originate on its network over the Local/IntraLATA Trunks; provided that all
calls that originate on a Party’s network and are exchanged without CPN information shall be billed as
either Local Traffic or IntraLATA Toll Traffic based upon a percentage of local usage (PLU) factor
calculated based on the amount of actual volume during the preceding three (3) months. The PLU will be
revised every three (3) months. If either Party fails to pass at least ninety percent (90%) of calls that
originate on its network with CPN within a monthly billing period, then either Party may require that
separate trunk groups for Local Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic be established. Transit traffic as defined
in Section 7.3 will be routed over the IntraLATA Toll trunk group.
IV.6.2 Measurement of Telecommunications traffic billed hereunder shall be (i) in actual
conversation time as specified in FCC terminating FGD Switched access tariffs for Local Traffic and (ii)
in accordance with applicable tariffs for all other types of Telecommunications traffic.
4.7 Reciprocal Compensation Arrangements -- Section 251(b)(5). Compensation for the
transport and termination of Local Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic shall be pursuant to this Section 4.7.
15
Page 26 of 354

The Reciprocal Compensation arrangements set forth in this Section 4.7 are not applicable to (i) Exchange
Access traffic, (ii) traffic terminated to Requesting Carrier using Ameritech’s unbundled switching and for
which the Requesting Carrier incurs no incremental cost to terminate traffic, (iii) traffic originated by one
Party on a number ported to its network that terminates to another number ported on that same Party’s
network or (iv) any other type of traffic found to be exempt from Reciprocal Compensation by the FCC
or the Commission. Pursuant to the arbitration decision of the Commission with respect to this Agreement
in Docket No. 00-0027 (“Arbitration Decision”), the Reciprocal Compensation arrangements are
applicable to Internet Service Provider(“ISP”)-bound traffic.2/ All Exchange Access traffic and IntraLATA
Toll Traffic shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of applicable federal and state tariffs.
Compensation for traffic that is delivered through Transit Service shall be pursuant to Section 7.2.
4.7.1 Reciprocal Compensation applies for transport and termination of Local Traffic
billable by Ameritech or Requesting Carrier which a Telephone Exchange Service Customer originates on
Ameritech’s or Requesting Carrier’s physical switch for termination on the other Party’s physical switch.
The originating Party shall compensate the terminating Party for the transport and termination of Local
Traffic for the function(s) provided by that terminating Party at the rate(s) provided at Item II of the Pricing
Schedule; provided that Requesting Carrier shall be paid the tandem rate (i.e. End Office Local
Termination, Tandem Switching, Tandem Transport Termination, and Tandem Transport Mileage).3/ The
Parties’ obligation to pay Reciprocal Compensation to each other shall commence on the date the Parties
agree that the network is complete (i.e., each Party has established its originating trunks as well as any
ancillary functions (e.g., 9-1-1)) and capable of fully supporting originating and terminating Customer (and
not a Party’s test) traffic.
4.7.2 Each Party shall charge the other Party its effective applicable federal and state
tariffed intraLATA FGD switched access rates for those functions a Party performs relating to the transport
and termination of IntraLATA Toll Traffic.
4.7.3 Compensation for transport and termination of all traffic which has been subject to
performance of INP by one Party for the other Party pursuant to Article XIII shall be as specified in
Section 13.7.
3/
By entering into this Agreement, Ameritech does not agree that ISP-bound traffic is “local” for the purposes of
application of reciprocal compensation under the Act, nor is Ameritech voluntarily agreeing to pay reciprocal
compensation for the transport and termination of ISP-bound traffic. Moreover, Ameritech reserves its rights to appeal
or otherwise seek review of the Arbitration Decision. Further, Ameritech reserves its rights to take advantage of any
Commission decision in the proceeding that it will open dealing with reciprocal compensation, including possible true-up
or retroactive payment.
4/ By entering into this Agreement, Ameritech does not agree that, based on its current network configuration, Requesting
Carrier is entitled to compensation for tandem switching and transport, nor is Ameritech voluntarily agreeing to pay
reciprocal compensation for tandem switching and transport in this case. Moreover, Ameritech reserves its rights to
appeal or otherwise seek review of the Arbitration Decision. Moreover, Ameritech reserves its rights to seek a
modification of this provision if the configuration of Requesting Carrier’s network were to change such that the factual
assumptions behind the Arbitration Decision in this regard were no longer applicable.

VII.2.3 Each Party’s operator bureau shall accept BLV and BLVI inquiries from the
operator bureau of the other Party in order to allow transparent provision of BLV/BLVI Traffic between
the Parties’ networks. When Requesting Carrier does not use Ameritech’s operator bureau, each Party
shall route BLV/BLVI Traffic inquiries over separate direct trunks (and not the Local/IntraLATA Trunks)
established between the Parties’ respective operator bureaus. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the Parties
shall configure BLV/BLVI trunks over the Interconnection architecture defined in Article III, consistent
with the Plan.
VII.2.4 Each Party shall compensate the other Party for BLV/BLVI Traffic as set forth at
Item IV of the Pricing Schedule.

VII.3 Transit Service.
VII.3.1 Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier Transit Service as provided in this
Section 7.2.
VII.3.2 “Transit Service” means the delivery over the Local/IntraLATA Trunks of
(i) Local Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic that (x) originates on Requesting Carrier’s network and
terminates to a third party LEC, ILEC or CMRS (such third parties collectively referred to as a “Transit
Counter-Party”) and (y) originates on the Transit Counter-Party’s network and terminates to Requesting
Carrier and (ii) 800 IntraLATA Toll Traffic that originates and terminates between one (1) or more
IntraLATA Telecommunications Carriers, including third party LECs, ILECs and CMRSs (collectively,
“IntraLATA 800 Traffic”), as more fully described in Section 7.3.9.
VII.3.3 Requesting Carrier shall route Transit Traffic via Ameritech’s Tandem Switches,
and not at or through any Ameritech End Office.
VII.3.4 While the Parties agree that it is the responsibility of the Requesting Carrier to enter
into arrangements with each Transit Counter-Party to deliver Terminating Transit Traffic to Requesting
Carrier, they acknowledge that such arrangements may not currently be in place and an interim arrangement
will facilitate traffic completion on an interim basis. Accordingly, until the earlier of (i) the date on which
either Party has entered into an arrangement with such Transit Counter-Party to deliver Termination Transit
Traffic to Requesting Carrier and (ii) the date Transit Traffic volumes originated by the Requesting Carrier
exceed the volumes specified in Section 7.3.5. Ameritech will provide Requesting Carrier with Transit
Service. Requesting Carrier agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into agreements with
Transit Counter-Parties as soon as possible after the Effective Date.
VII.3.5 If the traffic volumes between Requesting Carrier’s Central Office Switches and
Transit Counter-Party Central Office Switches (in each case, in the aggregate) at any time exceeds the
150,000 minutes of use per month over 2 consecutive months, the Implementation Team will develop a
migration plan for Requesting Carrier to interconnect directly with such Transit Counter-Party within 60
days of the second consecutive month.
VII.3.6 To the extent that the originating party of a call delivers each call to Ameritech’s
network with SS7 CCIS and the appropriate Transactional Capabilities Application Part (“TCAP”)
message, Ameritech will deliver such information to the terminating party.
VII.3.7 Requesting Carrier shall not bill Ameritech for any Transit Service traffic or
unidentified traffic (i.e., no CPN) unless otherwise agreed in writing by Ameritech.
21
Page 32 of 354

VII.3.8 The Parties shall compensate each other for Transit Service as follows:
(a) For Local Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic originating from Requesting Carrier
that is delivered over the Transit Service (“Originating Transit Traffic”),
Requesting Carrier shall:
(1) Pay to Ameritech a Transit Service charge as set forth in the Pricing
Schedule; and
(2) Reimburse Ameritech for any charges, including switched access charges
and Reciprocal Compensation, that a Transit Counter-Party imposes or
levies on Ameritech for delivery or termination of any such Originating
Transit Traffic.
(b) For Local Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic that is to be terminated to Requesting
Carrier from a Transit Counter-Party (“Terminating Transit Traffic”) (i) that
is not subject to Primary Toll Carrier (“PTC”) arrangements (regardless of
whether Ameritech is the PTC) and (ii) that Ameritech has a transiting arrangement
with such Transit Counter-Party that authorizes Ameritech to deliver such traffic
to Requesting Carrier (“Other Party Transit Agreement”), then Ameritech shall
deliver such Terminating Transit Traffic to Requesting Carrier in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such Other Party Transit Agreement and such third
party LEC or CMRS provider (and not Requesting Carrier) shall be responsible
to pay Ameritech the applicable Transit Service charge.
(c) For IntraLATA Toll Traffic which is subject to a PTC arrangement and where
Ameritech is the PTC, Ameritech shall deliver such IntraLATA Toll Traffic to
Requesting Carrier in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PTC
arrangement. Upon receipt of verifiable Primary Toll records, Ameritech shall
reimburse Requesting Carrier at Requesting Carrier’s applicable tariffed terminating
switched access rates. When transport mileage cannot be determined, an average
transit transport mileage shall be applied as set forth on the Pricing Schedule.
VII.3.9 IntraLATA 800 Traffic shall be exchanged between the Parties as follows:
(a) Queried IntraLATA 800 Traffic may be delivered to Ameritech over the Local
IntraLATA Trunks and if Ameritech performs the 800 query function, over the
Access Toll Connecting Trunks. If the Local/IntraLATA Trunks are used and
Requesting Carrier performs the 800 query function, the IntraLATA 800 Traffic
will be recorded as toll calls. If the Access Toll Connecting Trunks are used,
Ameritech will not record the IntraLATA 800 Traffic.
22
Page 33 of 354

(b) The Parties shall provide to each other IntraLATA 800 Access Detail Usage Data
for Customers billing and IntraLATA 800 Copy Detail Usage Data for access
billing. EMR exchange between the Parties will use the standard centralized
message system delivery systems (CMDS). The Parties agree to provide this data
to each other at no charge. In the event of errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in
data received from either Party, the liability of the Party providing such data shall
be limited to the provision of corrected data only.
(c) IntraLATA 800 Traffic calls are billed to and paid for by the called or terminating
party, regardless of which Party performs the 800 query. Since IntraLATA 800
Traffic may not be identified with a unique Carrier Identification Code (CIC),
billing shall be based on originating and terminating NPA/NXX.
VII.3.10 If a Transit Counter-Party requests Ameritech to block either Originating
Transit Traffic or Terminating Transit Traffic, Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier written notice of
such request. Requesting Carrier shall then have twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice from
Ameritech to resolve such blocking request with the Transit Counter-Party. If Requesting Carrier is unable
to resolve any outstanding issues with the Transit Counter-Party within such twenty (20) Business Day
period, Ameritech may block such Originating Transit Traffic or Terminating Transit Traffic. Requesting
Carrier agrees to either (i) block delivery of Transit Service traffic that it originates to the Ameritech
network (including Originating Transit Traffic) or (ii) pay Ameritech’s nonrecurring and recurring costs to
implement and administer blocking for such traffic. Requesting Carrier agrees to indemnify and hold
Ameritech harmless against any and all Losses Ameritech may incur from not blocking requested traffic
during the twenty (20) Business Day period.
VII.4 Toll Free Database Services.
VII.4.1 Call Routing Service. The Call Routing Service provides for the identification of
the carrier to whom a call is to be routed when a toll-free (1+800-NXX-XXXX or 1+888-NXX-XXXX)
call is originated by Customer. This function uses the dialed digits to identify the appropriate carrier and
is done by screening the full ten digits of the dialed number. The Call Routing Service may be provided in
conjunction with a Customer’s InterLATA or IntraLATA Switched Exchange Access Service.
When 800 Call-Routing service is provided, an originating call is suspended at the first switching
office equipped with a Service Switching Point (SSP) component of the SSC/SS7 Network. The SSP
launches a query over signaling links (A-links) to the Signal Transfer Point (STP), and from there to the
SCP. The SCP returns a message containing the identification of the carrier to whom the call should be
routed and the call is processed. Requesting Carrier may obtain Call Routing Service pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff.
23
Page 34 of 354

VII.4.2 Routing Options. In addition to the toll-free service offerings, new routing options
are offered. These options are purchased by toll-free service providers to allow their clients to define
complex routing requirements on their toll-free service. Toll-free routing options allow the service
provider’s Customer to route its toll-free calls to alternate carriers and/or destinations based on time of day,
day of week, specific date or other criteria. These routing options are in addition to the basic toll-free call
routing requirements which would include the toll-free number, the intraLATA carrier, the interLATA carrier
and the Area of Service (AOS). Requesting Carrier may obtain Routing Options pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff.
VII.4.3 Carrier Identification Service. Requesting Carrier may choose the 800 Carrier
Identification Service to obtain toll-free number screening. With this service, Requesting Carrier will launch
a query to the Ameritech database using its own Service Switching Points (SSPs) network. In contrast to
the Call Routing Service described in Section 7.4.1 above, with the 800 Carrier Identification service, no
routing is performed.
Requesting Carrier’s SS7 network is used to transport the query from its End Office to the
Ameritech SCP. Once Requesting Carrier’s identification is provided, Requesting Carrier may use the
information to route the toll-free traffic over its network. In these cases, Ameritech Switched Access
services are not used to deliver a call to Requesting Carrier. The toll-free carrier ID data may not be stored
for Requesting Carrier’s future use. Requesting Carrier may obtain 800 Carrier Identification Service
pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff.
VII.4.4 Number Administration. Requesting Carrier, at its option, may elect to use
Ameritech’s toll-free Service which includes toll-free Number Administration Service (NAS). With this
service, Ameritech will perform the Responsible Organization service, which involves interacting with the
national Service Management System (SMS/800), on behalf of the Customer. Responsible Organization
services include activating, deactivating and maintaining 800/888 number records as well as trouble referral
and clearance. If Requesting Carrier does not select NAS, Requesting Carrier will perform the Responsible
Organization service. Requesting Carrier may purchase the Number Administration Service pursuant to
the rates, terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff.
VII.5 LIDB Database Service.
VII.5.1 The Line Information Database (LIDB) Query Response Service is a validation
database system. It enables Requesting Carrier to offer alternatively billed services to its Customers. The
database provides an efficient way to validate calling cards and toll billing exception (TBE) (i.e., restricts
a collect or third-party billed call). Toll fraud protection and reduced call set up expenses are among the
benefits of the service.
VII.5.2 Billing information records include the Customer name, phone number, security
personal identification numbers and third-party acceptance indications. Prior to call completion, a query
24
Page 35 of 354

is launched to the LIDB to determine the validity of the requested billing method. The call is then completed
or denied based on the LIDB’s response. Requesting Carrier may purchase the LIDB Database Service
pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff.
VII.6 LNP Query Service.
Ameritech’s provision of LNP will utilize LRN switch software, the terms and conditions of
which are prescribed in Article XIII. With the implementation of LNP, Requesting Carrier has an N-1
(Network minus 1) responsibility to perform a LRN lookup on calls terminating to NPA-NXXs selected
for Number Portability. If Requesting Carrier does not perform this responsibility on calls terminated to the
Ameritech network, Ameritech will automatically perform the query and route the call to the proper
destination. Under such circumstances, Requesting Carrier agrees to pay Ameritech the per query rates
under the terms and conditions specified in Ameritech FCC No. 2 Access Tariff for LNP Query Service
(Sections 5.2, 6.4 & 6.9).
VII.7 Operator Services and Directory Assistance Services.
VII.7.1 This Section 7.7 establishes the terms and conditions governing the provision to
Requesting Carrier by Ameritech of manual and automated Local and intrastate intraLATA, interstate
intraLATA Operator Toll and Assist Services (“OS”), and Home NPA Directory Assistance service and
Information Call Completion Services (“DA”). Ameritech’s offering of OS and DA services is made
available as a stand alone, integrated service and not as an unbundled Network Element.
VII.7.2 At Requesting Carrier’s request, Ameritech will provide manual and automated OS
and DA services to Requesting Carrier. A description of the OS and DA services to be provided is set
forth on Schedule 7.7.2. A list identifying the NPA/Exchange areas of Ameritech Directory Assistance
and Information Call Completion services will be provided to Requesting Carrier upon request. The
Implementation Plan shall establish a process by which this list is updated as such DA services are provided
in additional NPA/Exchange Areas.
VII.7.3 Requesting Carrier is responsible for delivering its OS and DA traffic to
Ameritech’s TOPS switch. Specifically, Requesting Carrier shall provide the necessary direct trunking and
termination facilities from its End Office to the Ameritech TOPS switch used to provide OS and DA
services. Further, OS and DA traffic must be delivered to the Ameritech TOPS switch without any Tandem
switching. The TOPS location to which Requesting Carrier will be responsible for delivering its OS or DA
traffic will be determined by Ameritech based on the existing capacity of its service centers. Ameritech will,
unless technical or economic reasons provide otherwise, have Requesting Carrier deliver its OS or DA
traffic to the TOPS switch most closely located to the Requesting Carrier’s NPA/exchange originating the
call.
VII.7.4 Requesting Carrier is solely responsible for providing all equipment and facilities
to deliver OS and DA traffic to the Ameritech switch used to provide OS and DA services. Where the
25
Page 36 of 354

total traffic exceeds the capacity of the existing circuits, additional circuits and additional facilities must be
provided by Requesting Carrier to the extent necessary.
VII.7.5 Requesting Carrier will provide and maintain the equipment at its offices necessary
to permit Ameritech to perform its services in accordance with the equipment operations and traffic
operations which are in effect in Ameritech’s DA and operator services offices. Requesting Carrier will
locate, construct and maintain its facilities to afford reasonable protection against hazard and interference.
VII.7.6 Requesting Carrier will furnish to Ameritech all information necessary for
Ameritech’s provision of OS and DA. All information provided shall be treated as Proprietary Information
pursuant to Article XX. Requesting Carrier shall provide, at a minimum, the following applicable
information to Ameritech not less than ninety (90) days (or such earlier time as mutually agreed upon) prior
to the date on which Requesting Carrier requests Ameritech to provide OS and/or DA:
OS
· emergency agency phone numbers;
· rate information (such as mileage bands, operator surcharge information); and
· originating screening information.
DA
· listing information for the areas to be served by Ameritech; and
· network information necessary to provide for the direct trunking of the DA calls.
Requesting Carrier will keep these records current and will inform Ameritech, in writing, at least thirty (30)
days prior to any changes in the format to be made in such records. Requesting Carrier will inform
Ameritech of other changes in the records on a mutually agreed upon schedule.
VII.7.7 For branding of Calling Card, OS and DA calls, Ameritech shall record the
branding announcement, no longer than 3 seconds, for installation on each OS and DA switch serving
Requesting Carrier’s Customers. Requesting Carrier shall provide Ameritech the wording of the
announcement.
VII.7.8 Requesting Carrier grants to Ameritech during the Term a non-exclusive, license
to use the DA listings provided pursuant to this Agreement. DA listings provided to Ameritech by
Requesting Carrier under this Agreement will be maintained by Ameritech only for purposes of providing
DA information to Requesting Carrier Customers, and will not be disclosed to third parties. This section
does not prohibit Ameritech and Requesting Carrier from entering into a separate agreement which would
allow Ameritech to provide or sell Requesting Carrier’s DA listing information to third parties, but such
provision or sale would only occur under the terms and conditions of the separate agreement.
26

“Provisioning EI”) for the transfer and receipt of data necessary to perform each
of the pre-ordering, ordering and provisioning functions associated with Requesting
Carrier’s order of Resale Services. The Provisioning EI will be administered
through a gateway that will serve as a single point of contact for the transmission
of such data and will provide the functionality described in Schedule 10.13.2.
(b) Non-Electronic Orders. Prior to 2/28/00, Requesting Carrier shall establish the
Provisioning EI so that it may submit all orders for Resale Services to Ameritech
through such Provisioning EI. Ameritech shall have no obligation to accept or
provision any Requesting Carrier Service Order that is not submitted through the
Provisioning EI (a “Non-Electronic Order”) except if Requesting Carrier is
unable to submit a Service Order through the Provisioning EI and such inability is
caused (i) by Ameritech’s equipment and facilities (e.g., a functional limitation or
malfunction) or (ii) by the temporary interruption or malfunction of Requesting
Carrier systems or interfaces that precludes Requesting Carrier from using the
Provisioning EI. If Requesting Carrier submits a Non-Electronic Order for the
reasons set forth in clause (ii) above, the Parties agree that each Non-Electronic
32
Page 43 of 354

Order shall be (1) subject to additional non-recurring charges, as set forth in the
Pricing Schedule, that compensate Ameritech for its costs in accordance with
Section 252(d) of the Act to receive, process, provision and perform maintenance
and repair for such Non-Electronic Orders, (2) processed and provisioned on a
first-in, first-out basis with respect to all Non-Electronic Orders received by
Ameritech and (3) subject to a limit of twenty (20) orders per day (Region-Wide
and in the aggregate for all Non-Electronic Orders submitted hereunder, whether
for Resale Services, access to unbundled Network Elements or LNP or any
combination thereof). If Requesting Carrier intends to submit a Non-Electronic
Order for the reasons set forth in clause (ii) above, Requesting Carrier shall
provide written (via facsimile) and telephonic notice to its Ameritech account and
service managers as soon as possible but prior to submitting such orders and shall
provide in its notice (x) the reason Requesting Carrier is submitting such Non-
Electronic Orders in lieu of using the Provisioning EI, (y) the time period for which
Requesting Carrier will submit Non-Electronic Orders and (z) a good faith estimate
of the number of Non-Electronic Orders to be submitted during such time period.
Requesting Carrier agrees to use its best efforts to resume submitting Service
Orders via the Provisioning EI as soon as possible but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt by Ameritech of Requesting Carrier’s written notice
as described above. Ameritech shall have no obligation to accept or process Non-
Electronic Orders after such ten (10) Business Day period.
(c) Pre-Ordering Functions. Requesting Carrier shall also use the Provisioning EI to
access all of the other Operations Support Systems functions that are available
through such Provisioning EI and which are described on Schedule 10.13.2
and/or made available to Requesting Carrier after the Effective Date.
(d) Service Ordering and Provisioning. Service Orders will be placed by Requesting
Carrier and provisioned by Ameritech in accordance with the procedures
described in Section 10.7.
(e) Status Reports. After receipt and acceptance of a Service Order, Ameritech shall
provide Requesting Carrier with service status notices on an exception basis.
(f) Non-Interruption of Service. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or
pursuant to an order of a court or commission of competent jurisdiction, Ameritech
may not initiate any disconnect, suspension or termination of a Requesting Carrier
Customer’s Resale Service, unless directed to do so by Requesting Carrier by
transmission of a Service Order or Ameritech’s receipt of proper authorization to
change such Customer’s PLEC to a carrier other than Requesting Carrier.

10.3 Operations Support Systems Functions — Maintenance.
(a) Electronic Interface for Maintenance and Repair. Ameritech will provide access
to, and Requesting Carrier shall use, an electronic interface (the “Maintenance
EI”) for the transfer and receipt of data necessary to perform the maintenance and
repair functions (e.g., trouble receipt and trouble status). This interface will be
administered through a gateway that will serve as a single point of contact for the
transmission of such data.
(b) Maintenance. Maintenance will be provided by Ameritech as set forth in the
Implementation Plan and in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sections
10.7 and Schedule 10.13.
(c) Pre-Screening. Prior to referring troubles to Ameritech, Requesting Carrier shall
complete the same prescreening guidelines with its Customers that Ameritech
utilizes with its Customers; copies of which shall be provided by Ameritech to
Requesting Carrier upon Requesting Carrier’s request.
ARTICLE XI
NOTICE OF CHANGES -- SECTION 251(c)(5)
If a Party makes (i) a change in its network that will materially affect the interoperability of its
network with the other Party or (ii) changes Operations Support Systems functions that affect the operations
of the other Party, the Party making the change shall provide reasonable advance written notice of such
change to the other Party, and if applicable, within such time period as determined by the FCC or the
Commission and their respective rules and regulations.
ARTICLE XII
COLLOCATION -- SECTION 251(c)(6)
XII.1 Access to Collocation.
XII.1.1General. Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier Physical Collocation on
Ameritech’s Premises of equipment necessary for Interconnection (pursuant to Article III) or for access
to unbundled Network Elements (pursuant to Article IX), except that Ameritech will provide for Virtual
Collocation of such equipment if Ameritech demonstrates to the Commission that Physical Collocation is
not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, as provided in Section 251(c)(6) of the
Act. Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier Collocation only for the purpose of Interconnection or
access to Ameritech’s unbundled Network Elements and for no other purpose other than as specifically
provided by the Act, the Commission or the FCC.
34
Page 45 of 354

XII.1.2Non Discriminatory Basis. Collocation shall be made available to Requesting
Carrier by Ameritech on a nondiscriminatory basis to the priorities that Ameritech provides to itself, its
subsidiaries, Affiliates or other persons. The quality of design, performance, features, functions and other
characteristics of Collocation made available to Requesting Carrier under this Agreement shall be provided
on a nondiscriminatory basis to that which Ameritech provides in its network to itself, its subsidiaries, its
Affiliates or other persons.
12.1.3 Since the Parties have failed to agree on certain of the terms and conditions
applicable to Collocation, including but not limited to terms and conditions regarding cageless physical
collocation, shared caged collocation, and the equipment that may be collocated pursuant to Section 12.4.
Subject to the outcome of any appeal, including but not limited to any stay that may be obtained pending
appeal, the Parties agree to modify this Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Collocation Proceeding being conducted by the Illinois Commerce Commission, ICC Docket 99-0511 or
any other relevant state proceeding. If such modifications to the Agreement are not renegotiated within
thirty (30) days after the effective date of the ruling in such proceeding, a Party may consider such failure
to renegotiate a “Dispute” under Section 27.4 of this Agreement.
XII.2 Standard Collocation Offerings. Subject to Section 12.1 and Requesting Carrier’s
compliance with applicable Collocation request, ordering and payment provisions of this Agreement,
Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier access to the Standard Collocation Offerings described in this
Section 12.2. Any request by Requesting Carrier for Ameritech to provide a Collocation method (or
increment of space) not described in this Section 12.2 shall be made pursuant to Section 12.3.
XII.2.1Ameritech Physical Collocation Service. Upon request, Ameritech shall provide
Requesting Carrier Ameritech Physical Collocation Service (“APCS”) in any Unused Space. Caged
APCS is available in increments of fifty (50) or one hundred (100) square feet. Requesting Carrier may
install a transmission node enclosure itself or may request that Ameritech provide such enclosure.
Ameritech agrees to provide collocation space in increments of 36 inches by 36 inches (“36x36 footprint”)
for Requesting Carrier to use as cageless collocation space.
XII.2.2Virtual Collocation. Upon request, Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier
Virtual Collocation in any Unused Space. If Requesting Carrier wishes to Virtually Collocate a bay other
than a Standard Bay, it must request such Virtual Collocation via an NSCR. Requesting Carrier shall not
have physical access to its Virtually Collocated equipment but may, at its expense, electronically monitor
and control its Virtually Collocated equipment. Ameritech shall, subject to Requesting Carrier’s payment
of the applicable rates, fees and charges, be responsible for installing, maintaining and repairing Requesting
Carrier’s equipment. Requesting Carrier cannot convert its Virtually Collocated equipment “in-place” to
a method of Physical Collocation available hereunder (e.g., no “in-place” conversion of Virtual Collocation
to Cageless Physical Collocation). In addition to the rates set forth in Item VII of the Pricing Schedule, if
Ameritech must locate Requesting Carrier’s Virtual Collocation bays in its switch line-up, Requesting
Carrier shall also be responsible for any extraordinary costs necessary to condition such space.
35
Page 46 of 354

XII.3 Non-Standard Collocation Requests.
XII.3.1Non-Standard Collocation Request. Subject to Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2
Requesting Carrier may request Ameritech to provide a Collocation method (or an increment of space) not
described in Section 12.2 by submitting to Ameritech a Non-Standard Collocation Request in the form set
forth on Schedule 12.3 (an “NSCR”). Collocation requested via an NSCR shall (i) be subject to the
payment by Requesting Carrier of all applicable costs in accordance with Section 252(d)(1) of the Act to
process such request and to develop, provision and bill such Collocation method, (ii) be excluded from any
standard provisioning intervals or performance credits contained in this Agreement and (iii) require the
Parties to include in an amendment to this Agreement any rates, terms and conditions applicable to such
NSCR within thirty (30) days after Requesting Carrier confirms its order pursuant to the NSCR.
XII.3.2Adjacent Collocation. If and only if there is no Unused Space for Physical
Collocation, Requesting Carrier may submit to Ameritech an NSCR that requests Ameritech to provide
Requesting Carrier Adjacent Collocation to the extent technically feasible. As used in this Agreement,
“Adjacent Collocation” shall mean Collocation on Ameritech’s property in adjacent controlled
environmental vaults or similar structures (collectively, an “Adjacent Structure”). Ameritech shall only
be required to provide Adjacent Collocation if technically feasible, and subject to reasonable safety and
maintenance requirements, zoning and other state and local regulations. Ameritech shall provide power and
Physical Collocation services and facilities in and to Adjacent Structures subject to the same
nondiscrimination requirements as traditional Collocation arrangements. Requesting Carrier shall be
responsible for securing all required licenses and permits, the required site preparations and shall further
retain responsibility for securing and/or constructing the Adjacent Structure and any building and site
maintenance associated with the placement of such Adjacent Structure. Subject to zoning and safety
requirements, and provided Ameritech owns or controls the property in question, Ameritech reserves the
right to assign the location of the Adjacent Structure. Ameritech shall have no obligation to consider or
process an NSCR for Adjacent Collocation until Requesting Carrier has secured and provided Ameritech
evidence of final approval for the requested Adjacent Structure (and any transmission and power
connections) from (i) any applicable local governmental or other authority having jurisdiction to approve or
grant zoning compliance or waivers and (ii) if the land on which Requesting Carrier seeks to locate such
Adjacent Structure is not owned by Ameritech, such owner or landlord. Requesting Carrier shall not place
any signage or marking of any kind on a Adjacent Structure or on the Ameritech grounds surrounding the
Adjacent Structure. If space becomes available in Ameritech’s Premises, and Requesting Carrier elects
to order Collocation in such Premises in lieu of its Adjacent Collocation, then Requesting Carrier shall
remove its Adjacent Structure at its expense no later than sixty (60) days after Requesting Carrier’s
“replacement” Collocation within Ameritech’s Premises becomes operational.
XII.3.3ILEC Collocation. Requesting Carrier may also request via an NSCR that
Ameritech offer Requesting Carrier a collocation arrangement not offered in this Article XII but that has
been made available by another incumbent LEC (“ILEC Collocation”). A request for ILEC Collocation
is available subject to space and technical limitations.
36
Page 47 of 354

XII.4 Eligible Equipment for Collocation.
Types of Equipment: In accordance with Section 251(c)(6) of the Telecommunications Act,
Requesting Carrier may collocate equipment “necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network
elements.” For purposes of this section, “necessary” means directly related to and thus necessary, required,
or indispensable to interconnection or access to unbundled network elements. Such uses are limited to
interconnection to Ameritech’s network “for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange access,”
or for access to unbundled network elements “for the provision of a telecommunications service.”
Equipment that may be collocated solely for these purposes includes: (1) transmission equipment including,
but not limited to, optical terminating equipment and multiplexers; and (2) equipment being collocated to
terminate basic transmission facilities pursuant to sections 64.1401 and 64.1402 of 47 C.F.R. (Expanded
Interconnection) as of August 1, 1996.
In addition, Ameritech permits Requesting Carrier collocation of Multifunctional Equipment
included in the definition of “Advanced Services Equipment” in section 1.3.d of the SBC/Ameritech Merger
Conditions. Under the SBC/Ameritech Merger Condition, “Advanced Services Equipment” is defined as
follows: “(1) DSLAMs or functionally equivalent equipment; (2) spectrum splitters that are used solely in
the provision of Advanced Services; (3) packet switches and multiplexers such as ATMs and Frame Relay
engines used to provide Advanced Services; (4) modems used in the provision of packetized data; and (5)
DACS frames used inly in the provision of Advanced Services Spectrum Splitters (or the equivalent
functionality) used to separate the voice grade channell from the Advanced Services channel shall not be
considered Advanced Services Equipment; any such splitters installed after the Merger Closing Date that
are located at the customer premises shall be considered network terminating equipment.” In order to
qualify for collocation based on falling within the definition, the equipment in question must either (A) be
solely of the types, and exclusively for the uses, included in this definition or (B) be of such types, and for
such uses, combined solely with additional functions that are “necessary for interconnection or access to
unbundled network elements.” For instance, additional switching use, except as included in the next
paragraph, or enhanced services functionality would disqualify the equipment from collocation under this
definition.
Ameritech does not allow collocation of other Multifunctional Equipment, except that
Ameritech allows collocation of remote switch modules (“RSMs”) solely under the following conditions: (1)
RSM may not be used as a stand-alone switch; it must report back to and be controlled by a Requesting
Carrier identified and controlled (i.e., Requesting Carrier owned or leased) host switch, and direct trunking
to the RSM will not be permitted, and (2) the RSM equipment must be used only for the purpose of
interconnection Ameritech’s network for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service or
exchange access or for access to Ameritech’s unbundled network elements for the provision of a
telecommunications service. Ameritech will allow Requesting Carrier to collocate, on a non-discriminatory
basis, other multi-functional equipment only if Ameritech and Requesting Carrier mutually agree to such
collocation.
37
Page 48 of 354

For purposes of this section, “Multifunctional Equipment” means equipment that has (1)
functions that make the equipment “necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements”
and (2) additional functions that are not “necessary” for these purposes. Such additional functions include,
but are not limited to, switching and enhanced service functions.
Ameritech will not allow collocation of stand-alone switching equipment. For purposes of
this section, “stand-alone switching equipment” includes, but is not limited to, the following examples: (1)
equipment with switching capabilities included in 47 C.F.R. section 51.319(c); (2) equipment that is used
to obtain circuit switching capabilities, without reliance upon host switch, regardless of other functionality
that also may be combined in the equipment; (3) equipment that is used solely, fundamentally, or
predominately for switching and does not meet any of the above-described categories of equipment that
Ameritech allows, including qualifications stated for such categories; (4) functionality of a class 4 or 5
switch, with the following nonexlusive examples: Lucent Pathstar 5E, 4E, or 1A switch; DMS 10, 100, 200,
or 250 switch; Ericsson AXE-10 switch; Seimens EWSD; including any such switch combined with other
functionality. Ameritech will not allow collocation of any enhanced services equipment.
Ancillary equipment is not “necessary” for interconnection or access to UNEs. Ameritech
allows Requesting Carrier to place in its premises certain ancillary equipment solely to support and be used
with equipment that the Requesting Carrier has legitimately collocated in the same premises. Solely for this
purpose, cross-connect and other simple frames, routers, portable test equipment, equipment racks and
bays, cabinets for spares, and potential other ancillary equipment may be placed in Ameritech’s premises,
on a non-discriminatory basis, only if Ameritech and Requesting Carrier mutually agree to such placement.
Requesting Carrier may not place in Ameritech premises ancillary equipment that would duplicate
equipment used by Ameritech, and/or functions performed by Ameritech, as part of its provision of
infrastructure systems for collocation. Infrastructure systems include, but are not limited to, structural
components, such as floors capable of supporting equipment loads, heating, ventilating and air conditioning
(“HVAC”) systems, electrical systems (AC power), high efficiency filtration, humidity controls, remote
alarms, compartmentation, and smoke purge.
Pending the FCC’s reasonably timely remand proceedings in accordance with the Court’s
Opinion in GTE Service Corporation v. FCC, 205 F.3d 416 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“GTE Opinion”),
Ameritech will not disturb (1) equipment and (2) connection arrangements between different collocators’
equipment in an Ameritech premises, that prior to the May 11, 2000 effective date of the GTE Opinion (1)
were in place in Ameritech or (2) were requested by Requesting Carrier and accepted by Ameritech on
the same basis as under the FCC’s original, pre-vacated Collocation Order (Deployment of Wireline
Services Offering Advanced Telecommunications Capability, CC Docket No. 98-147, First Report and
Order (FCC 99-48), 14 FCC Rcd 4761 (1999). Ameritech reserves the right to assert that it may alter
or terminate these collocation arrangements immediately of a federal or state court or regulatory agency (1)
attempts to apply any of the most favored nation provisions of the Act, of any state Merger Conditions, or
of the FCC SBC/Ameritech Merger Conditions to such arrangements or (2) deems such arrangements to
be discriminatory vis-a-vis other carriers.

XII.4.1Safety Standards.
(a) All equipment to be Collocated in Ameritech’s Premises must comply, as of the date such
equipment is installed in Ameritech’s Premises, with then current (i) Bellcore Network
Equipment and Building Specifications (“NEBS”) Level 1 requirements, (ii) NEBS EMI
emissions requirements, as stated in GR-1089-CORE, Criteria [10], (iii) NEBS Corrosion
requirements, as stated in GR-1089-CORE, Criteria [72, 73], if such equipment has an
electrical connection to outside plant and (iv) safety requirements as Ameritech may
reasonably deem applicable to protect Ameritech’s Premises and equipment and Other
Collocator’s equipment; provided such safety requirements are applied on a
nondiscriminatory basis (items (i) - (iv) above collectively referred to as the “Safety
Standards”).
(b) If Ameritech denies Collocation of Requesting Carrier’s equipment in an Ameritech
Premises, citing Safety Standards, Ameritech will provide within five (5) Business Days of
Requesting Carrier’s written request to the Ameritech representative(s), identified on
TCNet, a list of all Ameritech network equipment that Ameritech has placed within the
network areas of such Premises within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of
Ameritech’s denial of Requesting Carrier’s equipment, together with an affidavit attesting
that the Ameritech network equipment on such list meets or exceeds the Safety Standard(s)
that Ameritech contends Requesting Carrier’s equipment fails to meet.
(c) If Requesting Carrier fails to provide Ameritech accurate and complete NEBS data sheets
and other applicable or relevant information prior to the Occupancy Date to confirm that
its equipment complies with the Safety Standards, Requesting Carrier shall not be
permitted to install such equipment in Ameritech’s Premises.
XII.4.2Equipment Compliance. (a) Except as provided in Section 12.4.3(b) below, prior
to placing its Collocation equipment in its Collocation space, Requesting Carrier shall submit to Ameritech
a list and description of the equipment Requesting Carrier wishes to place in its Collocation space so that
Ameritech can confirm that such equipment complies with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this
Section 12.4. Requesting Carrier shall provide, at a minimum, the following information with respect to
each piece of equipment it intends to Collocate in Ameritech’s Premises:
(1) Name of Hardware and Software Manufacturer;
(2) Model and Release Number; and
(3) Third-party certification by an independent qualified testing facility and any
necessary documentation that evidences compliance with the standards set
forth in Section 12.4.2.
Ameritech will review and confirm or deny Requesting Carrier’s list and description of equipment within ten
(10) Business Days after Ameritech receives an accurate and complete list (i.e., all information is completed
39
Page 50 of 354

and any necessary documentation is attached). Requesting Carrier shall not place its Collocation equipment
in its Collocation space until Requesting Carrier receives Ameritech’s written confirmation that such
equipment complies with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Section 12.4.
(b) Ameritech may, at its discretion, maintain on its Collocation webpage a list of equipment
that complies with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Section 12.4. If Ameritech does maintain
such a webpage of approved equipment, Requesting Carrier need not obtain prior approval from Ameritech
for a piece of equipment if such equipment (including model and release number(s)) is described as
“approved” on such webpage. Instead, at the final walkthrough, Requesting Carrier shall provide
Ameritech written certification that any equipment to be placed in its Collocation space for which pre-
certification was not received pursuant to Section 12.4.3(a) is listed as “approved” equipment on the then-
current Collocation webpage.
XII.4.3Disputes on Eligible Equipment. If Ameritech denies Requesting Carrier the ability
to Collocate equipment on the grounds that such equipment does not comply with the requirements of this
Section 12.4, such denial shall be deemed a Dispute and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 27.4.
XII.5 Transport Facility Options. For both Physical Collocation and Virtual Collocation,
Requesting Carrier may either purchase unbundled transport facilities (and any necessary Cross-
Connection) from Ameritech or provide its own or third-party leased transport facilities and terminate those
transport facilities in its equipment located in its Collocation space at Ameritech’s Premises.
XII.6 Interconnection with other Collocated Carriers. Upon placement of a service order,
Ameritech shall permit Requesting Carrier to Interconnect its network with that of another Collocating
Telecommunications Carrier at Ameritech’s Premises by connecting its Collocated equipment to the
Collocated equipment of the other Telecommunications Carrier (“Carrier Cross-Connect Service for
Interconnection” or “CCCSI”) only if Requesting Carrier and the other collocating Telecommunications
Carrier’s Collocated equipment are used for Interconnection with Ameritech or to access Ameritech’s
unbundled Network Elements. Requesting Carrier may construct its own CCCSI (using copper cable or
optical fiber equipment) between the two carriers’ Collocated equipment. Such CCCSI (i) must, at a
minimum, comply in all respects with Ameritech’s technical and engineering requirements and (ii) shall
require Requesting Carrier to lease Ameritech cable rack and/or riser space to carry the connecting
transport facility. The rates for leasing of cable rack and riser space are set forth at Item VII of the Pricing
Schedule. If Requesting Carrier Interconnects its network with another Collocating Telecommunications
Carrier pursuant to this Section 12.6, Requesting Carrier shall, in addition to its indemnity obligations set
forth in Article XXIV and Section 12.10.7, indemnify Ameritech for any Loss arising from Requesting
Carrier’s installation, use, maintenance or removal of such connection with the other Collocating
Telecommunications Carrier, to the extent caused by the actions or inactions of Requesting Carrier or its
agents, including the other Collocating carrier.
40

XII.7 Interconnection Points and Cables.
Ameritech shall:
XII.7.1provide Requesting Carrier an Interconnection point or points physically accessible
by both Ameritech and Requesting Carrier, at which the fiber optic cable carrying Requesting Carrier’s
circuits can enter Ameritech’s Premises; provided that Ameritech shall designate Interconnection Points as
close as reasonably possible to Ameritech’s Premises;
XII.7.2 provide at least two (2) such Interconnection points at Ameritech’s Premises
at which there are at least two (2) entry points for Requesting Carrier’s cable facilities, and at which space
is available for new facilities in at least two (2) of those entry points; and
XII.7.3 permit Requesting Carrier Interconnection of copper or coaxial cable if such
Interconnection is first approved by the Commission.
XII.8 Space Exhaustion.
XII.8.1Ameritech shall post on a publicly available Internet site, a document (the
“Exhaustion Report”) that identifies each Ameritech Premises for which Physical Collocation is
unavailable because of space limitations. Ameritech will update the Exhaustion Report to add additional
Premises that run out of Physical Collocation space and to remove Premises in which Physical Collocation
becomes available within ten (10) Business Days of the date on which space becomes exhausted or
available, as applicable, at such Premises. Ameritech will recover from Requesting Carrier its costs to
provide the Exhaustion Report in the manner determined by the Commission.
XII.8.2(a) Upon Requesting Carrier’s order, Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier
a report (the “Premises Report”) that includes for a specific Premises:
(1) the amount of Physical Collocation Space available in that Premises;
(2) the number of Telecommunications Carriers Physically Collocated in that Premises
at the time of such request;
(3) any modifications in the use of space in that Premises since Ameritech last provided
a report on such Premises; and
(4) any measures Ameritech is taking to make additional space available in that
Premises for Physical Collocation.
Premises Reports shall be ordered by noting so in the Remarks section of the Collocation order form and
shall specifically identify the CLLI code of each Premises for which a report is ordered. A Premises Report
shall be deemed Proprietary Information of Ameritech and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
of Article XX.
41
Page 52 of 354

(b) The intervals for delivering a Premises Report are as follows:
Number of Premises Reports
Requested within a Five (5) Premises Report
Business Day Period Delivery Interval
1-5 Ten (10) Business Days
6-20 Twenty-Five (25) Business Days
If Requesting Carrier requests twenty-one (21) or more Premises Reports within a five (5)
Business Day period, the Premises Report Delivery Interval will be increased by five (5)
Business Days for every five (5) additional Premises Report requests or fraction thereof.
(c) Requesting Carrier shall compensate Ameritech on a time and materials basis for
each Premises Report ordered, such charges to be determined in accordance with
Section 252(d) of the Act (including any applicable contribution).
XII.8.3If Ameritech denies a request for Physical Collocation because of space limitations
in a given Premises, Requesting Carrier may request that Ameritech provide a tour (without charge) of such
Premises within ten (10) Business Days (or such later date as mutually agreed) of Requesting Carrier’s
written request for such tour, delivered to the Ameritech representative(s) identified on TCNet; provided,
however, that Ameritech shall not be required to provide a tour of any Premises that is listed in the
Exhaustion Report if the Commission or an independent third party auditor has confirmed that Physical
Collocation space is unavailable in such Premises because of space limitations or is otherwise not
practicable. Each request for a Premises tour must include (i) the Premises where Physical Collocation was
denied, (ii) the date of such denial and (iii) the applicable Ameritech order numbers. Requesting Carrier
shall be permitted to tour the entire Premises, not just the room in which space was denied and may bring
not more than two (2) representatives on the tour. Prior to taking a tour, each representative must execute
and deliver to Ameritech Ameritech’s standard nondisclosure agreement. In no event shall any camera or
other video/audio recording device be brought on or utilized during any tour of an Ameritech Premises.
XII.8.4 At the request of the Commission or Requesting Carrier, Ameritech shall remove
any obsolete and unused equipment (e.g., “retired in-place”) from its Premises. Ameritech shall be
permitted to recover the cost of removal and/or relocation of such equipment if Ameritech incurs expenses
that would not otherwise have been incurred (at the time of the request or subsequent thereto) except to
increase the amount of space available for collocation (e.g., costs to expedite removal of equipment or store
equipment for reuse).
XII.8.5If Ameritech denies Requesting Carrier’s Physical Collocation request because of
space limitations and, after touring the applicable Premises, the Parties are unable to resolve the issue of
whether the denial of space was proper, Ameritech shall, in connection with any complaint filed by
42
Page 53 of 354

Requesting Carrier, file with the Commission detailed floor plans or diagrams of such Premises, subject to
protective order.
XII.9 Allocation of Collocation Space.
XII.9.1After Requesting Carrier is occupying Physical Collocation space in a given
Premises, Requesting Carrier may reserve additional Physical Collocation space for its future use in that
Ameritech Premises in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 12.9.1. Ameritech shall notify
Requesting Carrier in writing if another Telecommunications Carrier requests Collocation space that is
reserved by Requesting Carrier. Requesting Carrier shall within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such
notice provide Ameritech either (i) written notice that Requesting Carrier relinquishes such space or (ii)
enforce its reservation of space in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 12.9.1. Failure of
Requesting Carrier to respond to Ameritech within the foregoing five (5) Business Day period shall be
deemed an election by Requesting Carrier to relinquish such space. As used in this Article XII, “space”
shall refer to, as applicable, floor space or bays.
XII.9.2Ameritech shall not be required to lease or construct additional space in its
Premises to provide Requesting Carrier Physical Collocation when existing space in such Premises has been
exhausted.
XII.9.3Requesting Carrier will provide Ameritech with a two (2)-year rolling forecast of
its requirements for Collocation that will be reviewed jointly on a yearly basis by the Parties, in accordance
with the planning processes described on Schedule 12.9.3. Ameritech will attempt to deliver Collocation
pursuant to Requesting Carrier’s forecasts to the extent that Collocation space is then available.
XII.10 Security Arrangements.
XII.10.1 General Security Arrangements. The following security arrangements shall
apply to Requesting Carrier’s access to and use of Ameritech’s Premises for Collocation. Each of the
below security arrangements are intended to protect Ameritech’s network and equipment from harm, and
to ensure network security and reliability. Ameritech shall not impose security requirements that result in
increased Collocation costs unless such security requirements have concomitant benefits of providing
necessary protection of Ameritech’s equipment. If, at any time after the Effective Date, Ameritech imposes
more stringent security arrangements upon its employees or its authorized vendors, Ameritech shall provide
written notice to Requesting Carrier of such new security arrangements and the Parties shall execute an
amendment to this Agreement to incorporate such new security arrangements, with such amendment to be
effective no later than thirty (30) days after Requesting Carrier’s receipt of such written notice.
XII.10.2 Access to Physical Collocation. (a) Requesting Carrier shall have 24 x 7
access to its Physical Collocation (APCS) as specifically described in this Article XII. Subject to the last
sentence of subsection (b) below, once Ameritech has implemented in an Ameritech Premises the security
arrangements described in this Article XII, Requesting Carrier may access such Premises without an
43
Page 54 of 354

escort. However, prior to the date on which security arrangements have been implemented in specific
Premises, security escorts shall be required, at no cost to Requesting Carrier. Requesting Carrier shall
provide Ameritech with telephonic notice at the time of dispatch of Requesting Carrier’s employees to an
Ameritech Premises and, if possible, no less than sixty (60) minutes notice prior to arrival at such Premises.
(b) Requesting Carrier shall receive 24 x 7 access to Ameritech’s Premises only after
the Delivery Date of its Physical Collocation arrangement. Prior to that date, Requesting Carrier may only
access Ameritech Premises for the purposes set forth in this Article XII (e.g., initial walk-through and
acceptance walk-through) and only with an Ameritech representative. Prior to the date Requesting Carrier
is provided access to its Physical Collocation, any Requesting Carrier employee seeking to access an
Ameritech Premises must obtain a photo I.D. and, once access is provided, wear such photo I.D. while in
the Ameritech Premises. Until a photo I.D. is issued, Requesting Carrier’s employees shall require a
security escort in Ameritech’s Premises, at no cost to Requesting Carrier.
(c) Ameritech (and its agents, employees, and other Ameritech-authorized persons)
shall have the right to enter Requesting Carrier’s Physical Collocation at any reasonable time on three (3)
days advance notice of the time and purpose of the entry to examine its condition, make repairs required
to be made by Ameritech, and for any other purpose deemed reasonable by Ameritech. Ameritech may
also access Requesting Carrier’s Physical Collocation for purpose of averting any threat of harm imposed
by Requesting Carrier or its equipment or facilities upon the operation of Ameritech equipment, facilities
and/or personnel located outside of Requesting Carrier’s Physical Collocation. Ameritech will notify
Requesting Carrier by telephone of any emergency entry and will leave written notice of such entry in the
Physical Collocation. If routine inspections are required, they shall be conducted at a mutually agreeable
time.
XII.10.3 Physical Security Arrangements. Ameritech may, at its sole discretion, adopt
reasonable security arrangements to protect its equipment, including separating its equipment with a
partition, installing security cameras or other monitoring devices, badges with computerized tracking
systems, photo I.D., electronic or keyed access and/or logs. If any of the security arrangements adopted
by Ameritech require the participation of Requesting Carrier’s employees (e.g., electronic access cards,
or badges or photo I.D.), Requesting Carrier agrees on behalf of itself and its employees to comply with
any rules applicable to such arrangements. Upon resignation, suspension, retirement or termination of any
employee or technician that Requesting Carrier has secured badges or electronic access cards or keys to
Ameritech’s Premises, Requesting Carrier shall recover said badge, access cards and/or keys from such
individuals and return them to Ameritech. Ameritech may bill Requesting Carrier to change locks, badges
or access cards due to these items not being returned to Ameritech. Ameritech shall recover its costs from
Requesting Carrier to install, maintain and repair any security arrangements in the manner (i.e., nonrecurring
or recurring) determined by the Commission. Any information collected by Ameritech in the course of
implementing or operating security arrangements shall be deemed “Proprietary Information” and subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations of Article XX.
44

XII.10.4 Security Checks and Training. Requesting Carrier shall conduct background
checks of each of its employees, technicians and vendors that access Ameritech’s Premises. Ameritech
shall provide Requesting Carrier a list of actions for which Ameritech precludes persons from accessing
Ameritech’s Premises and Requesting Carrier shall apply such actions to its employees and vendors.
Requesting Carrier’s employees and approved vendors shall be required to undergo the same level of
security training, or its equivalent, that Ameritech’s own employees or vendors providing similar functions,
must undergo. Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier information on the specific type of training so
that Requesting Carrier may provide such security training. Requesting Carrier shall provide Ameritech
written certification that its employees and approved vendors have satisfied the necessary security training
prior to accessing Ameritech’s Premises.
XII.10.5 Breach of Security Rules. If a Requesting Carrier employee violates the
security rules applicable to Ameritech’s Premises, Ameritech shall have the right to remove such employee
from the Premises immediately and thereafter refuse such employee access to Ameritech’s Premises.
XII.10.6 Insurance. Requesting Carrier shall furnish Ameritech with certificates of
insurance which evidence the minimum levels of insurance set forth in Section 19.8, state the types of
insurance and policy limits provided Requesting Carrier and name Ameritech as an additional insured. All
insurance must be in effect and received on or before the Occupancy Date and shall remain in force as long
as any of Requesting Carrier’s facilities or equipment remain within Ameritech’s Premises. If Requesting
Carrier fails to maintain the coverage, Requesting Carrier hereby authorizes Ameritech, and Ameritech may,
but is not required to, pay the premiums thereon, and if so, shall be reimbursed by Requesting Carrier.
Requesting Carrier must also conform immediately to the recommendation(s) specific to its Collocation
space, or the Ameritech Premises, in general, which are made by Ameritech’s property insurance company
as a result of a fire safety inspection. To the extent that these recommendation(s) also apply to Ameritech,
Requesting Carrier shall only be required to conform to those recommendation(s) implemented by
Ameritech. The cancellation clause on the certificate of insurance will be amended to read as follows:
“SHOULD ANY OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED POLICIES BE CANCELLED OR
MATERIALLY CHANGED, THE ISSUING COMPANY WILL MAIL 30 DAYS WRITTEN
NOTICE TO THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER(S).”
Any vendor approved by Ameritech to enter Ameritech’s Premises to perform work or services for or on
behalf of Requesting Carrier must also, as a condition of such approval, maintain the same insurance
requirements set forth in Section 19.8.
XII.10.7 Indemnification. In addition to its indemnity obligations set forth in Section
24.1, Requesting Carrier shall indemnify Ameritech for any Loss to Ameritech or a third party caused in
whole or in part, by acts or omissions, negligence or otherwise, of Requesting Carrier, its employees, or
vendors performing work on Requesting Carrier’s behalf in Ameritech’s Premises, including any Loss as
a result of (i) injury to or death of any person; (ii) damage to or loss or destruction of any property, real or
45
Page 56 of 354

personal, or (iii) attachments, liens or claims of material person’s or laborers arising out of, resulting from,
or in connection with any services performed on behalf of Requesting Carrier.
XII.10.8 Disclaimer of Responsibility. Requesting Carrier acknowledges that Ameritech
provides carriers other than Requesting Carrier Physical Collocation in Ameritech’s Premises, which
carriers may include competitors of Requesting Carrier, and that those carriers’ employees, technicians and
vendors (such third party carriers, employees, technicians and vendors collectively referred to as the
“Other Collocators”) will access the Ameritech Premises in which Requesting Carrier’s equipment is
Physically Collocated. Requesting Carrier further acknowledges that Other Collocators may, if Requesting
Carrier has ordered Cageless Physical Collocation, have access to Requesting Carrier’s Collocated
equipment and/or if Requesting Carrier has a form of caged Physical Collocation, have access to the area
immediately surrounding the transmission node enclosure, which enclosure is a permeable boundary that
will not prevent the Other Collocators from observing or even damaging/injuring Requesting Carrier’s
equipment, facilities or personnel. Requesting Carrier agrees that Ameritech shall have no obligation to
monitor Requesting Carrier’s Physically Collocated equipment and that, in addition to any other applicable
limitation contained herein, Ameritech shall have no responsibility nor liability for any Loss to Requesting
Carrier, its equipment or personnel with respect to any act or omission by any Other Collocators, regardless
of the degree of culpability of any such Other Collocators, except if such Loss is caused by an Ameritech
employee or vendor specifically performing work on Ameritech’s behalf (and not an Ameritech authorized
vendor that happens to be performing work for another carrier Collocated in Ameritech’s Premises).
XII.11 Subcontractor and Vendor Approval. Requesting Carrier may install and maintain its
Physically Collocated equipment or, it may subcontract such responsibilities to an Ameritech-approved
vendor. All installation work, whether performed by Requesting Carrier or an Ameritech-approved vendor,
shall comply in all respects with Ameritech’s technical, engineering and environmental requirements and is
subject to Ameritech’s inspection upon completion of such work. Requesting Carrier shall be solely
responsible for all costs associated with the planning, installation and maintenance of its Collocated
equipment.
XII.12 Delivery of Collocated Space.
XII.12.1 Ordering.
(a) Ameritech shall provide Requesting Carrier with a single point of contact for all inquiries
regarding Collocation. Requesting Carrier shall request space for Collocation by delivering to Ameritech
a complete and accepted Collocation order form (if completed, a “Collo Order”). Each Collo Order shall
include a Collocation Application Fee and specify (i) the Premises in which Collocation is requested, (ii)
the amount of space requested, (iii) a prioritized list of its preferred methods of Collocation, if and as
applicable (e.g., APCS cageless, shared, etc.), (iv) the interoffice transmission facilities Requesting Carrier
will require for such space, (v) the equipment to be housed in such space, (vi) Requesting Carrier’s
anticipated power requirements for the space, (vii) any extraordinary additions or modifications (e.g.,

Requesting Carrier’s Collocated equipment, (viii) the specific level of diversity for fiber and power cabling
to and from the Collocated space and (ix) the date on which Requesting Carrier intends to initiate service
from such space. Ameritech shall notify Requesting Carrier in writing (the “Collo Response”) as to
whether the requested space and preferred method(s) of Collocation are available within the interval
specified in subsection (b) below. If space is not available for Physical Collocation, Ameritech shall
specify in its Collo Response to Requesting Carrier when space for Physical Collocation will be made
available to Requesting Carrier and shall offer to Requesting Carrier Virtual Collocation in accordance with
Section 12.12.3. If intraoffice facilities will not be available for Collocation within three (3) months of
receipt of Requesting Carrier’s (and, if applicable, each Resident Collocator’s) payment of the Initial
COBO fee for Physical Collocation, or twelve (12) weeks after receipt of Requesting Carrier’s Collo
Order for Virtual Collocation pursuant to Section 12.12.1, then Ameritech shall provide written notification,
within ten (10) Business Days after the initial walk-through, as to when the intraoffice facilities will be made
available.
(b) Ameritech shall deliver its Collo Response to Requesting Carrier within the following
intervals, which intervals commence on the day after Ameritech receives a complete and accurate Collo

or change its Collo Request, Requesting Carrier must sign or initial any such
modifications or changes and provide Ameritech a change order reflecting
same within five (5) Business Days of such initial walk-through. If a change or
modification is noted at the initial walk-through, Ameritech shall have no
obligation to commence work on Requesting Carrier’s Collocation space until
it receives a change order to amend the Collo Request or written confirmation
that Requesting Carrier does not wish to pursue such change or modification.
Failure to provide Ameritech the change order or written confirmation within
the foregoing five (5) Business Day period shall be deemed a Requesting
Carrier Delaying Event for the period between the expiration of such five (5)
day period and the date of actual receipt by Ameritech.
(c) Ameritech shall deliver to Requesting Carrier the requested space on or before
the later of (i) one hundred twenty (120) days from Ameritech’s receipt of

ninety (90) days of the Occupancy Date the equipment necessary for
Interconnection with Ameritech and/or access to Ameritech’s unbundled
Network Elements to be housed in such space or (ii) Requesting Carrier (or
one of its Resident Collocators, if applicable) fails to Interconnect to the
Ameritech network within one hundred fifty (150) days of the Occupancy
Date. If Requesting Carrier is required to vacate the space pursuant to this
Section 12.12.2(e), Requesting Carrier (and its Resident Collocators) shall
vacate such space within ninety (90) Business Days of the earliest to occur of
the foregoing events. If, after vacating a space, Requesting Carrier still
requires Collocation in that Premises, Requesting Carrier shall be required to
submit a new request for Collocation pursuant to the provisions of Section
12.12.1.
48

ACCESS TO POLES, DUCTS, CONDUITS AND
RIGHTS-OF-WAY -- SECTIONS 251(b)(4) AND 224 OF THE ACT
XVI.1 Structure Availability.
XVI.1.1 Ameritech shall make available, to the extent it may lawfully do so, access to
poles, ducts, conduits and Rights-of-way along Ameritech’s distribution network that are owned or
controlled by Ameritech (individually and collectively, “Structure”) for the placement of Requesting
Carrier’s wires, cables and related facilities (individually and collectively, “Attachments”). “Rights-of-
way” means (i) a legal interest of Ameritech in property of others, such as an easement or license, suitable
for use for communications distribution facilities or (ii) Ameritech’s owned or leased property if such
property is used for communications distribution facilities; provided, however, it does not generally include
controlled environment vaults, remote equipment buildings, huts or enclosures, cross-connect cabinets,
panels and boxes, equipment closets or enclosures in buildings, or any like or similar equipment enclosures
or locations, or the ducts or conduit connecting any of the foregoing to manholes or conduit runs between
manholes. The availability of Ameritech Structure for Requesting Carrier’s Attachments is subject to and
dependent upon all rights, privileges, franchises or authorities granted by governmental entities with
jurisdiction, existing and future agreements with other persons not inconsistent with Section 16.18, all
interests in property granted by persons or entities public or private, and Applicable Law, and all terms,
conditions and limitations of any or all of the foregoing, by which Ameritech owns and controls Structure
or interests therein.
XVI.1.2 Ameritech will not make Structure available: (1) where, after taking all
reasonable steps to accommodate such request, there is Insufficient Capacity to accommodate the
requested Attachment, and (2) an Attachment cannot be accommodated based upon nondiscriminatorily
applied considerations of safety, reliability or engineering principles. For purposes of this Article XVI,
“Insufficient Capacity” means the lack of existing available space on or in Structure and the inability to
create the necessary space by taking all reasonable steps to do so. Before denying a request for access
based upon Insufficient Capacity, Ameritech will, in good faith, explore potential accommodations with
Requesting Carrier. If Ameritech denies a request by Requesting Carrier for access to its Structure for
Insufficient Capacity, safety, reliability or engineering reasons, Ameritech will provide Requesting Carrier
a detailed, written reason for such denial as soon as practicable but, in any event, within forty-five (45) days
of the date of such request.
XVI.2 Franchises, Permits and Consents. Requesting Carrier shall be solely responsible to
secure any necessary franchises, permits or consents from federal, state, county or municipal authorities and
from the owners of private property, to construct and operate its Attachments at the location of the
Ameritech Structure it uses. Requesting Carrier shall indemnify Ameritech against loss directly resulting
from any actual lack of Requesting Carrier’s lawful authority to occupy such Rights-of-way and construct
its Attachments therein.
57

XVI.3 Access and Modifications. Where necessary to accommodate a request for access of
Requesting Carrier, and provided Ameritech has not denied access as described in Section 16.1.2, or
because Ameritech may not lawfully make the Structure available, Ameritech will, as set forth below, modify
its Structure in order to accommodate the Attachments of Requesting Carrier. Upon request, Ameritech
may permit Requesting Carrier to conduct Field Survey Work and Make Ready Work itself or through
Ameritech-approved contractors in circumstances where Ameritech is unable to complete such work in a
reasonable time frame. (For purposes of this Agreement, a “modification” shall mean any action that either
adds future capacity to, or increases the existing capacity of, a given facility. By way of example, adding
a bracket to a pole that is immediately utilized or adding innerduct to an existing duct does not qualify as
a “modification,” while adding taller poles, adding new ducts between existing manholes and rebuilding
manholes to accommodate additional cables would qualify as a “modification.”)
XVI.3.1 Before commencing the work necessary to provide such additional capacity,
Ameritech will notify all other parties having Attachments on or in the Structure of the proposed modification
to the Structure. Where possible, Ameritech shall include in a modification to accommodate Requesting
Carrier’s Attachment(s) those modifications required to accommodate other attaching parties, including
Ameritech, that desire to modify their Attachments.
XVI.3.2 If Requesting Carrier requests access to an Ameritech Right-of-way where
Ameritech has no existing Structure, Ameritech shall not be required to construct new poles, conduits or
ducts, or to bury cable for Requesting Carrier but will be required to make the Right-of-way available to
Requesting Carrier to construct its own poles, conduits or ducts or to bury its own cable; provided,
however, if Ameritech desires to extend its own Attachments, Ameritech will construct Structure to
accommodate Requesting Carrier’s Attachments.
XVI.3.3 The costs of modifying a Structure to accommodate Requesting Carrier’s
request, an existing or prospective attaching party’s request, or the needs of Ameritech, shall be borne by
the party requesting such modification, except that if other parties obtain access to the Structure as a result
of the modification, such parties shall share in the cost of such modification proportionately with the party
initiating the modification. A party, including Ameritech, with a pre-existing Attachment to the Structure to
be modified to accommodate Requesting Carrier shall be deemed to directly benefit from the modification
if, after receiving notification of the modification, it adds to or modifies its Attachment. If a party, including
Ameritech, uses the modification to bring its Structure or Attachments into compliance with applicable safety
or other requirements, it shall be considered as sharing in the modification and shall share the costs of the
modification attributable to its upgrade. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an attaching party, including
Ameritech, with a pre-existing Attachment to the Structure shall not be required to bear any of the costs
of rearranging or replacing its Attachment if such rearrangement or replacement is necessitated solely as a
result of an additional Attachment or the modification of an existing Attachment sought by another attaching
party, including Requesting Carrier. If an attaching party, including Ameritech, makes an Attachment to the
Structure after the completion of the modification, such party shall share proportionately in the cost of the
modification if such modification rendered the added attachment possible.
58
Page 69 of 354

XVI.3.4 All modifications to Ameritech’s Structure will be owned by Ameritech.
Requesting Carrier and other parties, including Ameritech, who contributed to the cost of a modification,
may recover their proportionate share of the depreciated value of such modifications from parties
subsequently seeking Attachment to the modified structure.
XVI.4 Installation and Maintenance Responsibility. Requesting Carrier shall, at its own
expense, install and maintain its Attachments in a safe condition and in thorough repair so as not to conflict
with the use of the Structure by Ameritech or by other attaching parties. Work performed by Requesting
Carrier on, in or about Ameritech’s Structures shall be performed by properly trained, competent workmen
skilled in the trade. Ameritech will specify the location on the Structure where Requesting Carrier’s
Attachment shall be placed, which location shall be designated in a nondiscriminatory manner. Requesting
Carrier shall construct each Attachment in conformance with the permit issued by Ameritech for such
Attachment. Other than routine maintenance and service wire Attachments, Requesting Carrier shall not
modify, supplement or rearrange any Attachment without first obtaining a permit therefor. Requesting
Carrier shall provide Ameritech with notice before entering any Structure for construction or maintenance
purposes.
XVI.5 Installation and Maintenance Standards. Requesting Carrier’s Attachments shall be
installed and maintained in accordance with the rules, requirements and specifications of the National
Electrical Code, National Electrical Safety Code, Bellcore Construction Practices, the FCC, the
Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Act and the valid and lawful rules, requirements and
specifications of any other governing authority having jurisdiction over the subject matter.
XVI.6 Implementation Team. The Implementation Team shall develop cooperative procedures
for implementing the terms of this Article XVI and to set out such procedures in the Implementation Plan.
XVI.7 Access Requests. Any request by Requesting Carrier for access to Ameritech’s
Structure shall be in writing and submitted to Ameritech’s Structure Access Center. Ameritech may
prescribe a reasonable process for orderly administration of such requests. Each Requesting Carrier’s
Attachment to Ameritech’s Structure shall be pursuant to a permit issued by Ameritech for each request
for access. The Structure Access Coordinator shall be responsible for processing requests for access to
Ameritech’s Structure, administration of the process of delivery of access to Ameritech’s Structure and for
all other matters relating to access to Ameritech’s Structure. Requesting Carrier shall provide Ameritech
with notice before entering any Ameritech Structure.
XVI.8 Unused Space. Except for maintenance ducts as provided in Section 16.9 and ducts
required to be reserved for use by municipalities, all useable but unused space on Structure owned or
controlled by Ameritech shall be available for the Attachments of Requesting Carrier, Ameritech or other
providers of Telecommunications Services, cable television systems and other persons that are permitted
by Applicable Law to attach. Requesting Carrier may not reserve space on Ameritech Structure for its
future needs. Ameritech shall not reserve space on Ameritech Structure for the future need of Ameritech
nor permit any other person to reserve such space. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Requesting Carrier may
59
Page 70 of 354

provide Ameritech with a two (2)-year rolling forecast of its growth requirements for Structure that will be
reviewed jointly on an annual basis.
XVI.9 Maintenance Ducts. If currently available, one duct and one inner-duct in each conduit
section shall be kept vacant as maintenance ducts. If not currently available and additional ducts are added,
maintenance ducts will be established as part of the modification. Maintenance ducts shall be made
available to Requesting Carrier for maintenance purposes if it has a corresponding Attachment.
XVI.10 Applicability. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all Ameritech Structure
now occupied by Requesting Carrier.
XVI.11 Other Arrangements. Requesting Carrier’s use of Ameritech Structure is subject to any
valid, lawful and nondiscriminatory arrangements Ameritech may now or hereafter have with others
pertaining to the Structure.
XVI.12 Cost of Certain Modifications. If Ameritech is required by a governmental entity, court
or Commission to move, replace or change the location, alignment or grade of its conduits or poles, each
Party shall bear its own expenses of relocating its own equipment and facilities. However, if such alteration
is required solely due to Ameritech’s negligence in originally installing the Structure, Ameritech shall be
responsible for Requesting Carrier’s expenses. If a move of Requesting Carrier’s Attachment is required
by Ameritech or another attaching party, Requesting Carrier shall move its Attachment, at the expense of
the party requesting such move, within thirty (30) days after notification of the required move. If Requesting
Carrier fails to move its Attachment within the foregoing period, Requesting Carrier authorizes Ameritech
to move such Attachment.
XVI.13 Maps and Records. Ameritech will provide Requesting Carrier, at Requesting Carrier’s
request and expense, with access to maps, records and additional information relating to its Structure within
the time frames agreed upon by the Implementation Team; provided that Ameritech may redact any
Proprietary Information (of Ameritech or third parties) contained or reflected in any such maps, records or
additional information before providing access to such information to Requesting Carrier. Ameritech does
not warrant the accuracy or completeness of information on any maps or records. Maps, records and
additional information are provided solely for the use by Requesting Carrier and such materials may not be
resold, licensed or distributed to any other person.
XVI.14 Occupancy Permit. Requesting Carrier occupancy of Structure shall be pursuant to a
permit issued by Ameritech for each requested Attachment. Any such permit shall terminate (a) if
Requesting Carrier’s franchise, consent or other authorization from federal, state, county or municipal
entities or private property owners is terminated, (b) if Requesting Carrier has not placed and put into
service its Attachments within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date Ameritech has notified
Requesting Carrier that such Structure is available for Requesting Carrier’s Attachments, (c) if Requesting
Carrier ceases to use such Attachment for any period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, (d)
if Requesting Carrier fails to comply with a material term or condition of this Article XVI and does not
60
Page 71 of 354

correct such noncompliance within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice thereof from Ameritech or (e) if
Ameritech ceases to have the right or authority to maintain its Structure, or any part thereof, to which
Requesting Carrier has Attachments. If Ameritech ceases to have the right or authority to maintain its
Structure, or any part thereof, to which Requesting Carrier has Attachments, Ameritech shall (i) provide
Requesting Carrier notice within ten (10) Business Days after Ameritech has knowledge of such fact and
(ii) not require Requesting Carrier to remove its Attachments from such Structure prior to Ameritech’s
removal of its own attachments. Ameritech will provide Requesting Carrier with at least sixty (60) days’
written notice prior to (x) terminating a permit for an Attachment, terminating service to a Requesting Carrier
Attachment, or removal of an Attachment, in each case for a breach of the provisions of this Article XVI,
(y) any increase in the rates for Attachments to Ameritech’s Structure permitted by the terms of this
Agreement, or (z) any modification to Ameritech’s Structure to which Requesting Carrier has an
Attachment, other than a modification associated with routine maintenance or as a result of an emergency.
If Requesting Carrier surrenders its permit for any reason (including forfeiture under the terms of this
Agreement), but fails to remove its Attachments from the Structure within one hundred eighty (180) days
after the event requiring Requesting Carrier to so surrender such permit, Ameritech shall remove Requesting
Carrier’s Attachments at Requesting Carrier’s expense. If Ameritech discovers that Requesting Carrier has
placed an Attachment on Ameritech’s Structure without a valid permit, Ameritech shall notify Requesting
Carrier of the existence of such unauthorized Attachment and Requesting Carrier shall pay to Ameritech
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice an unauthorized Attachment fee equal to five (5)
times the annual attachment fee for such unauthorized Attachment. Within the foregoing period, Requesting
Carrier shall also apply for an Occupancy Permit for the unauthorized Attachment. In addition, Requesting
Carrier shall go through the process of any Make Ready Work that may be required for the unauthorized
Attachment. If Requesting Carrier fails to pay the unauthorized Attachment fee or apply for the required
Occupancy Permit within the foregoing period, Ameritech shall have the right to remove such unauthorized
Attachment from Ameritech’s Structure at Requesting Carrier’s expense.
XVI.15 Inspections. Ameritech may make periodic inspections of any part of the Attachments
of Requesting Carrier located on Ameritech Structure. Requesting Carrier shall reimburse Ameritech for
the costs (as defined in Section 252(d) of the Act) of such inspections. Where reasonably practicable to
do so, Ameritech shall provide prior written notice to Requesting Carrier of such inspections.
XVI.16 Damage to Attachments. Both Requesting Carrier and Ameritech will exercise
precautions to avoid damaging the Attachments of the other or to any Ameritech Structure to which
Requesting Carrier obtains access hereunder. Subject to the limitations in Article XXV, the Party
damaging the Attachments of the other Party shall be responsible to such other Party therefor.
XVI.17 Charges. Ameritech’s charges for Structure provided hereunder shall be determined in
compliance with the regulations to be established by the FCC pursuant to Section 224 of the Act. Prior
to the establishment of such rates, the initial charges applicable to Structure hereunder shall be as set forth
at Item VIII of the Pricing Schedule. Ameritech reserves the right to adjust the charges for Structure
provided hereunder consistent with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ameritech reserves the
right to price on a case-by-case basis any extraordinary Attachment to Structure. An “extraordinary
61
Page 72 of 354

Attachment” is any Attachment to Structure that is not typical of Attachments commonly made to Structure
and that impacts the usability of the Structure in excess of a typical Attachment or that presents greater than
typical engineering, reliability or safety concerns to other attaching parties or users of the Structure. A
deposit shall be required from Requesting Carrier for map preparation, field surveys and Make-Ready
Work.
XVI.18 Nondiscrimination. Except as otherwise permitted by Applicable Law, access to
Ameritech-owned or -controlled Structure under this Article XVI shall be provided to Requesting Carrier
on a basis that is nondiscriminatory to that which Ameritech provides its Structure to itself, its Affiliates,
Customers, or any other person.
XVI.19 Interconnection.
XVI.19.1 Upon request by Requesting Carrier, Ameritech will permit the interconnection
of ducts or conduits owned by Requesting Carrier in Ameritech manholes. However, such interconnection
in Ameritech manholes will not be permitted where modification of Ameritech’s Structure to accommodate
Requesting Carrier’s request for interconnection is possible.
XVI.19.2 Except where required herein, requests by Requesting Carrier for
interconnection of Requesting Carrier’s Attachments in or on Ameritech Structure with the Attachments of
other attaching parties in or on Ameritech Structure will be considered on a case-by-case basis and
permitted or denied based on the applicable standards set forth in this Article XVI for reasons of
Insufficient Capacity, safety, reliability and engineering. Ameritech will provide a written response to
Requesting Carrier’s request within forty-five (45) days of Ameritech’s receipt of such request.
XVI.19.3 Requesting Carrier shall be responsible for the costs to accommodate any
interconnection pursuant to this Section 16.19.
XVI.20 Cost Imputation. Ameritech will impute costs consistent with the rules under Section
224(g) of the Act.
XVI.21 Structure Access Center. Requests for access to Ameritech Structure shall be made
through Ameritech’s Structure Access Center, which shall be Requesting Carrier’s single point of contact
for all matters relating to Requesting Carrier’s access to Ameritech’s Structure. The Structure Access
Center shall be responsible for processing requests for access to Ameritech’s Structure, administration of
the process of delivery of access to Ameritech’s Structure and for all other matters relating to access to
Ameritech’s Structure.
XVI.22 State Regulation. The terms and conditions in this Article XVI shall be modified
through negotiation between the Parties to comply with the regulations of the state in which Ameritech owns
or controls Structure to which Requesting Carrier seeks access if such state meets the requirements of
Section 224(c) of the Act for regulating rates, terms and conditions for pole attachments and so certifies
62
Page 73 of 354

to the FCC under Section 224(c) of the Act and the applicable FCC rules pertaining thereto. Until the
terms and conditions of this Article XVI are renegotiated, the rules, regulations and orders of such state
so certifying shall supersede any provision herein inconsistent therewith.
XVI.23 Abandonments, Sales or Dispositions. Ameritech shall notify Requesting Carrier of
the proposed abandonment, sale, or other intended disposition of any Structure. In the event of a sale or
other disposition of the conduit system or pole, Ameritech shall condition the sale or other disposition to
include and incorporate the rights granted to Requesting Carrier hereunder.
ARTICLE XVII
REFERRAL ANNOUNCEMENT
When a Customer changes its service provider from Ameritech to Requesting Carrier, or from
Requesting Carrier to Ameritech, and does not retain its original telephone number, the Party formerly
providing service to such Customer shall provide a referral announcement (“Referral Announcement”)
on the abandoned telephone number which provides details on the Customer’s new number. Referral
Announcements shall be provided by a Party to the other Party for the period of time and at the rates set
forth in the first Party’s tariff(s). However, if either Party provides Referral Announcements for a period
different (either shorter or longer) than the period(s) stated in its tariff(s) when its Customers change their
telephone numbers, such Party shall provide the same level of service to Customers of the other Party.
ARTICLE XVIII

XIX.6 Certain Network Facilities. Each Party is individually responsible to provide facilities
within its network which are necessary for routing, transporting, measuring, and billing traffic from the other
Party’s network and for delivering such traffic to the other Party’s network using industry standard format
and to terminate the traffic it receives in that standard format to the proper address on its network. Such
facility shall be designed based upon the description and forecasts provided under Sections 19.5.1, 19.5.2
and, if applicable, 19.5.3. The Parties are each solely responsible for participation in and compliance with
national network plans, including The National Network Security Plan and The Emergency Preparedness
Plan.
XIX.7 Traffic Management and Network Harm.
XIX.7.1 Each Party may use protective network traffic management controls, such as
7-digit and 10-digit code gaps on traffic toward the other Party’s network, when required to protect the
public-switched network from congestion due to facility failures, switch congestion or failure or focused
overload. Each Party shall immediately notify the other Party of any protective control action planned or
executed.
XIX.7.2 Where the capability exists, originating or terminating traffic reroutes may be
implemented by either Party to temporarily relieve network congestion due to facility failures or abnormal
calling patterns. Reroutes shall not be used to circumvent normal trunk servicing. Expansive controls shall
be used only when mutually agreed to by the Parties.
67
Page 78 of 354

XIX.7.3 The Parties shall cooperate and share pre-planning information regarding cross-
network call-ins expected to generate large or focused temporary increases in call volumes, to prevent or
mitigate the impact of these events on the public-switched network.
XIX.7.4 Neither Party shall use any product or service provided under this Agreement
or any other service related thereto or used in combination therewith in any manner that interferes with any
person in the use of such person’s Telecommunications Service, prevents any person from using its
Telecommunications Service, impairs the quality of Telecommunications Service to other carriers or to either
Party’s Customers, causes electrical hazards to either Party’s personnel, damage to either Party’s
equipment or malfunction of either Party’s billing equipment.
19.7.5 Ameritech generally changes circuit pairs under the following conditions: (i) line
and station transfers or installations; (ii) to eliminate defective pairs during
repairs; and (iii) during facility rehabilitation projects. In the event that
Ameritech changes out a circuit pair sold under this Agreement under
conditions other than provided above, and that change adversely affects the
provision of service, Requesting Carrier will notify Ameritech and Ameritech
will attempt to resolve the problem within a reasonable time frame. Should the
Parties be unable to resolve the situation, the Parties agree to abide by the
dispute resolutions provisions contained in Section 27.4 of this Agreement.
XIX.8 Insurance. At all times during the term of this Agreement, each Party shall keep and
maintain in force at such Party’s expense all insurance required by Applicable Law, general liability
insurance in the amount of at least $10,000,000 and worker’s compensation insurance. Upon request from
the other Party, each Party shall provide to the other Party evidence of such insurance (which may be
provided through a program of self-insurance).
XIX.9 Labor Relations. Each Party shall be responsible for labor relations with its own
employees. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party as soon as practicable whenever such Party has
knowledge that a labor dispute concerning its employees is delaying or threatens to delay such Party’s
timely performance of its obligations under this Agreement and shall endeavor to minimize impairment of
service to the other Party (by using its management personnel to perform work or by other means) in the
event of a labor dispute to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.
XIX.10 Good Faith Performance. Each Party shall act in good faith in its performance under
this Agreement and, in each case in which a Party’s consent or agreement is required or requested

ARTICLE XX
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
XX.1 Definition of Proprietary Information.
XX.1.1“Proprietary Information” means:
(a) all proprietary or confidential information of a Party (a “Disclosing Party”)
including specifications, drawings, sketches, business information, forecasts,
records (including each Party’s records regarding Performance Benchmarks),
Customer Proprietary Network Information, Customer Usage Data, audit
information, models, samples, data, system interfaces, computer programs and
other software and documentation that is furnished or made available or otherwise
disclosed to the other Party or any of such other Party’s Affiliates (individually and
collectively, a “Receiving Party”) pursuant to this Agreement and, if written, is
marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary” or by other similar notice or if oral or
visual, is either identified as “Confidential” or “Proprietary” at the time of disclosure
or is summarized in a writing so identified and delivered to the Receiving Party
within ten (10) days of such disclosure; and
(b) any portion of any notes, analyses, data, compilations, studies, interpretations or
other documents prepared by any Receiving Party to the extent the same contain,
reflect, are derived from, or are based upon, any of the information described in
subsection (a) above, unless such information contained or reflected in such notes,
analyses, etc. is so commingled with the Receiving Party’s information that
disclosure could not possibly disclose the underlying proprietary or confidential
information (such portions of such notes, analyses, etc. referred to herein as
“Derivative Information”).
XX.1.2The Disclosing Party will use its reasonable efforts to follow its customary practices
regarding the marking of tangible Proprietary Information as “confidential,” “proprietary,” or other similar
designation. The Parties agree that the designation in writing by the Disclosing Party that information is
confidential or proprietary shall create a presumption that such information is confidential or proprietary to
the extent such designation is reasonable.
XX.1.3Notwithstanding the requirements of this Article XX, all information relating to the
Customers of a Party, including information that would constitute Customer Proprietary Network
Information of a Party pursuant to the Act and FCC rules and regulations, and Customer Usage Data,
whether disclosed by one Party to the other Party or otherwise acquired by a Party in the course of the
performance of this Agreement, shall be deemed “Proprietary Information.”
70
Page 81 of 354

XX.2 Disclosure and Use.
XX.2.1Each Receiving Party agrees that from and after the Effective Date:
(a) all Proprietary Information communicated, whether before, on or after the Effective
Date, to it or any of its contractors, consultants or agents (“Representatives”)
in connection with this Agreement shall be held in confidence to the same extent as
such Receiving Party holds its own confidential information; provided that such
Receiving Party or Representative shall not use less than a reasonable standard of
care in maintaining the confidentiality of such information;
(b) it will not, and it will not permit any of its employees, Affiliates or Representatives
to disclose such Proprietary Information to any third person;
(c) it will disclose Proprietary Information only to those of its employees, Affiliates and
Representatives who have a need for it in connection with the use or provision of
services required to fulfill this Agreement; and
(d) it will, and will cause each of its employees, Affiliates and Representatives to use
such Proprietary Information only to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to use services provided by the Disclosing Party hereunder and for no other
purpose, including its own marketing purposes.
XX.2.2A Receiving Party may disclose Proprietary Information of a Disclosing Party to
its Representatives who need to know such information to perform their obligations under this Agreement;
provided that before disclosing any Proprietary Information to any Representative, such Party shall notify
such Representative of such person’s obligation to comply with this Agreement. Any Receiving Party so
disclosing Proprietary Information shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its
Representatives and such Receiving Party agrees, at its sole expense, to use its reasonable efforts (including
court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from any prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of
the Proprietary Information. Each Receiving Party making such disclosure shall notify the Disclosing Party
as soon as possible if it has knowledge of a breach of this Agreement in any material respect. A Disclosing
Party shall not disclose Proprietary Information directly to a Representative of the Receiving Party without
the prior written authorization of the Receiving Party.
XX.2.3Proprietary Information shall not be reproduced by any Receiving Party in any form
except to the extent (i) necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 20.3 and (ii) reasonably
necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement. All such reproductions shall bear the same
copyright and proprietary rights notices as are contained in or on the original.
XX.2.4This Section 20.2 shall not apply to any Proprietary Information which the
Receiving Party can establish to have:
71
Page 82 of 354

(a) been disclosed by the Receiving Party with the Disclosing Party’s prior written
consent;
(b) become generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by a
Receiving Party;
(c) been independently developed by a Receiving Party by an individual who has not
had knowledge of or direct or indirect access to such Proprietary Information;
(d) been rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third person without
knowledge that such third person is obligated to protect its confidentiality; provided
that such Receiving Party has exercised commercially reasonable efforts to
determine whether such third person has any such obligation; or
(e) been obligated to be produced or disclosed by Applicable Law; provided that such
production or disclosure shall have been made in accordance with Section 20.3.
XX.3 Government Disclosure.
XX.3.1If a Receiving Party desires to disclose or provide to the Commission, the FCC or
any other governmental authority any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, such Receiving Party
shall, prior to and as a condition of such disclosure, (i) provide the Disclosing Party with written notice and
the form of such proposed disclosure as soon as possible but in any event early enough to allow the
Disclosing Party to protect its interests in the Proprietary Information to be disclosed and (ii) attempt to
obtain in accordance with the applicable procedures of the intended recipient of such Proprietary
Information an order, appropriate protective relief or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such Proprietary Information.
XX.3.2If a Receiving Party is required by any governmental authority or by Applicable
Law to disclose any Proprietary Information, then such Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party
with written notice of such requirement as soon as possible and prior to such disclosure. Upon receipt of
written notice of the requirement to disclose Proprietary Information, the Disclosing Party, at its expense,
may then either seek appropriate protective relief in advance of such requirement to prevent all or part of
such disclosure or waive the Receiving Party’s compliance with this Section 20.3 with respect to all or part
of such requirement.
XX.3.3The Receiving Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Disclosing Party in attempting to obtain any protective relief which such Disclosing Party chooses to
seek pursuant to this Section 20.3. In the absence of such relief, if the
Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose any Proprietary Information, then the Receiving Party shall
exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information,
72
Page 83 of 354

including cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the Proprietary Information.
XX.4 Ownership.
XX.4.1All Proprietary Information, other than Derivative Information, shall remain the
property of the Disclosing Party, and all documents or other tangible media delivered to the Receiving Party
that embody such Proprietary Information shall be, at the option of the Disclosing Party, either promptly
returned to Disclosing Party or destroyed, except as otherwise may be required from time to time by
Applicable Law (in which case the use and disclosure of such Proprietary Information will continue to be
subject to this Agreement), upon the earlier of (i) the date on which the Receiving Party’s need for it has
expired and (ii) the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
XX.4.2At the request of the Disclosing Party, any Derivative Information shall be, at the
option of the Receiving Party, either promptly returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed, except as
otherwise may be required from time to time by Applicable Law (in which case the use and disclosure of
such Derivative Information will continue to be subject to this Agreement), upon the earlier of (i) the date
on which the Receiving Party’s need for it has expired and (ii) the expiration or termination of this
Agreement.
XX.4.3The Receiving Party may at any time either return the Proprietary Information to
the Disclosing Party or destroy such Proprietary Information. If the Receiving Party elects to destroy
Proprietary Information, all copies of such information shall be destroyed and upon the written request of
the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall provide to the Disclosing Party written certification of such
destruction. The destruction or return of Proprietary Information shall not relieve any Receiving Party of
its obligation to treat such Proprietary Information in the manner required by this Agreement.
ARTICLE XXI
TERM AND TERMINATION
XXI.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
continue in full force and effect until and including August 19, 2003 (the “Initial Term”). Upon expiration
of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for additional one (1)-year periods (each,
a “Renewal Term”; “Renewal Term” and “Initial Term” sometimes collectively referred to herein as
the “Term”) unless a Party delivers to the other Party written notice of termination of this Agreement at
least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or a Renewal Term.
73
Page 84 of 354

XXI.2 Renegotiation of Certain Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
21.1, upon delivery of written notice at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the
Initial Term or any Renewal Term, either Party may require negotiations of any or all of the rates, prices,
charges, terms, and conditions of the products and services described in this Agreement, with such resulting
rates, prices, charges, terms and conditions to be effective upon expiration of the Term. Upon receipt of
notice, each Party shall have a good faith obligation to engage in such negotiations. If the Parties are unable
to satisfactorily negotiate such new rates, prices, charges and terms within ninety (90) days of such written
notice, either Party may petition the Commission or take such other action as may be necessary to establish
appropriate terms. If prior to the expiration of the Term, the Parties are unable to mutually agree on such
new rates, prices, charges, terms and conditions, or the Commission has not issued its order to establish
such provisions, the Parties agree that the rates, terms and conditions ultimately ordered by such
Commission or negotiated by the Parties shall be effective retroactive to the expiration date of such Term.
XXI.3 Default. When a Party believes that the other Party is in violation of a material term or
condition of this Agreement (“Defaulting Party”), it shall provide written notice to such Defaulting Party
of such violation prior to commencing the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 27.3 and it shall
be resolved in accordance with the procedures established in Section 27.3.
XXI.4 Payment Upon Expiration or Termination. In the case of the expiration or termination
of this Agreement for any reason, each of the Parties shall be entitled to payment for all services performed
and expenses accrued or incurred prior to such expiration or termination.

THE SERVICES, FUNCTIONS AND PRODUCTS IT PROVIDES OR IS CONTEMPLATED TO
PROVIDE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.
ARTICLE XXIII
SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, each Party
agrees that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of
the Parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to effect the intent of the Parties, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with
enforceable language that reflects such intent as closely as possible.
ARTICLE XXIV

Page 85 of 354

INDEMNIFICATION
XXIV.1 General Indemnity Rights. A Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend
and indemnify the other Party, its officers, directors, employees and permitted assignees (collectively, the
“Indemnified Party”) and hold such Indemnified Party harmless against
(a) any Loss to a third person arising out of the negligent acts or omissions, or willful
misconduct (“Fault”) by such Indemnifying Party or the Fault of its employees,
agents and subcontractors; provided, however, that (1) with respect to employees
or agents of the Indemnifying Party, such Fault occurs while performing within the
scope of their employment, (2) with respect to subcontractors of the Indemnifying
Party, such Fault occurs in the course of performing duties of the subcontractor
under its subcontract with the Indemnifying Party, and (3) with respect to the Fault
of employees or agents of such subcontractor, such Fault occurs while performing
within the scope of their employment by the subcontractor with respect to such
duties of the subcontractor under the subcontract;
(b) any Loss arising from such Indemnifying Party’s use of services offered under this
Agreement, involving pending or threatened claims, actions, proceedings or suits
(“Claims”) for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, or infringement of Intellectual
Property rights arising from the Indemnifying Party’s own communications or the
communications of such Indemnifying Party’s Customers;
(c) any Loss arising from Claims for actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual
Property right of a third person to the extent that such Loss arises from an
Indemnified Party’s or an Indemnified Party’s Customer’s use of a service
provided under this Agreement; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Party’s
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party shall not apply in the case
of (i) (A) any use by an Indemnified Party of a service (or element thereof) in
combination with elements, services or systems supplied by the Indemnified Party
or persons other than the Indemnifying Party or (B) where an Indemnified Party or
its Customer modifies or directs the Indemnifying Party to modify such service and
(ii) no infringement would have occurred without such combined use or
modification; and
(d) any and all penalties imposed upon the Indemnifying Party’s failure to comply with
the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (“CALEA”)
and, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, any amounts necessary
to modify or replace any equipment, facilities or services provided to the
Indemnified Party under this Agreement to ensure that such equipment, facilities
and services fully comply with CALEA.
75
Page 86 of 354

XXIV.2 Limitation on Liquidated Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall an Indemnifying Party have an obligation to indemnify, defend, hold the
Indemnified Party harmless or reimburse the Indemnified Party or its Customers for any Loss arising out
of a Claim for liquidated damages asserted against such Indemnified Party.
XXIV.3 Indemnification Procedures. Whenever a Claim shall arise for indemnification under
this Article XXIV, the relevant Indemnified Party, as appropriate, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party and request the Indemnifying Party to defend the same. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party might have, except to the
extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend against such liability or assertion in which event the Indemnifying Party
shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of acceptance of the defense of such Claim and the identity
of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. Until such time as Indemnifying Party provides such written
notice of acceptance of the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend such Claim, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to any right of the Indemnifying Party, to seek reimbursement
for the costs of such defense in the event that it is determined that Indemnifying Party had no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have exclusive right to control
and conduct the defense and settlement of any such Claims subject to consultation with the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement by the Indemnified Party unless such
Indemnifying Party has approved such settlement in advance and agrees to be bound by the agreement
incorporating such settlement. At any time, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to refuse a compromise
or settlement and, at such refusing Party’s cost, to take over such defense; provided that in such event the
Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for, nor shall it be obligated to indemnify the relevant Indemnified
Party against, any cost or liability in excess of such refused compromise or settlement. With respect to any
defense accepted by the Indemnifying Party, the relevant Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
with the Indemnifying Party in such defense if the Claim requests equitable relief or other relief that could
affect the rights of the Indemnified Party and also shall be entitled to employ separate counsel for such
defense at such Indemnified Party’s expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any
indemnified Claim as provided above, the relevant Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel
for such defense at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Each Party agrees to cooperate and to cause
its employees and agents to cooperate with the other Party in the defense of any such Claim and the relevant
records of each Party shall be available to the other Party with respect to any such defense, subject to the
restrictions and limitations set forth in Article XX.

ARTICLE XXV
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
XXV.1 Limited Responsibility. A Party shall be responsible only for service(s) and facility(ies)
which are provided by that Party, its authorized agents, subcontractors, or others retained by such parties,
and neither Party shall bear any responsibility for the services and facilities provided by the other Party, its
Affiliates, agents, subcontractors, or other persons retained by such parties. No Party shall be liable for
any act or omission of another Telecommunications Carrier (other than an Affiliate) providing a portion of
a service nor shall Ameritech be responsible for Requesting Carrier or Requesting Carrier’s Customer’s
integration of service components.
XXV.2 Apportionment of Fault. In the case of any Loss arising from the negligence or willful
misconduct of both Parties, each Party shall bear, and its obligation shall be limited to, that portion of the
resulting expense caused by its negligence or misconduct or the negligence or misconduct of such Party’s
Affiliates, agents, contractors or other persons acting in concert with it.
XXV.3 Limitation of Damages. Except for indemnity obligations under Article XXIV, a
Party’s liability to the other Party for any Loss relating to or arising out of any negligent act or omission in
its performance of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be limited to the total amount
properly charged to the other Party by such negligent or breaching Party for the service(s) or function(s)
not performed or improperly performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases involving any Claim for
a Loss associated with the installation, provision, termination, maintenance, repair or restoration of an
individual Network Element or a Resale Service provided for a specific Customer of the other Party, the
negligent or breaching Party’s liability shall be limited to the greater of: (i) the total amount properly charged
to the other Party for the service or function not performed or improperly performed and (ii) the amount
such negligent or breaching Party would have been liable to its Customer if the comparable retail service
was provided directly to its Customer.
XXV.4 Limitations in Tariffs. A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and
contracts with its Customers or third parties that relate to any service, product or function provided or
contemplated under this Agreement that, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Party
shall not be liable to such Customer or third party for (i) any Loss relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds the amount such Party would have charged
the applicable person for the service, product or function that gave rise to such Loss and (ii) any
Consequential Damages (as defined in Section 25.5). To the extent a Party elects not to place in its tariffs
or contracts such limitation(s) of liability, and the other Party incurs a Loss as a result thereof, such Party
shall indemnify and reimburse the other Party for that portion of the Loss that would have been limited had
the first Party included in its tariffs and contracts the limitation(s) of liability described in this Section 25.4.
XXV.5 Consequential Damages. In no event shall a Party have any liability whatsoever to the
other Party for any indirect, special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, including loss of
anticipated profits or revenue or other economic loss in connection with or arising from anything said,
77
Page 88 of 354

omitted or done hereunder (collectively, “Consequential Damages”), even if the other Party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages; provided that the foregoing shall not limit a Party’s obligation
under Section 24.1 to indemnify, defend and hold the other Party harmless against any amounts payable
to a third person, including any losses, costs, fines, penalties, criminal or civil judgments or settlements,
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and Consequential Damages of such third person.
XXV.6Remedies. Except as expressly provided herein, no remedy set forth in this Agreement
is intended to be exclusive and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights
or remedies now or hereafter existing under applicable law or otherwise.
25.7 By executing this Agreement, Requesting Carrier does not waive its right to receive any
benefits provided by the stipulations or conditions adopted or otherwise acknowledged by the Commission
or FCC in approving the SBC/Ameritech merger subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth
in such stipulations or conditions. In accordance with Paragraph 75 of the FCC Conditions, if any of the
FCC Conditions contained in this Agreement and conditions imposed in connection with the merger under
Illinois law grant similar rights against Ameritech, Requesting Carrier shall not have a right to invoke the
relevant terms of the FCC Conditions contained in this Agreement, if Requesting Carrier has invoked
substantially related conditions imposed on the merger under Illinois law.
ARTICLE XXVI
BILLING
XXVI.1 Billing. Each Party will bill all applicable charges, at the rates set forth herein, in the
Pricing Schedule and as set forth in applicable tariffs or contracts referenced herein, for the services
provided by that Party to the other Party in accordance with this Article XXVI and the Implementation
Plan.
XXVI.2 Recording. To the extent technically feasible, the Parties shall record call detail
information associated with calls originated or terminated to the other Party as specifically required herein.
XXVI.3 Payment of Charges. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Requesting Carrier and
Ameritech will pay each other within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of an invoice (the “Bill Due
Date”). If the Bill Due Date is on a day other than a Business Day, payment will be made on the next
Business Day. Payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars via electronic funds transfer to the other Party’s bank
account. Within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, the Parties shall provide each other the name and
address of its bank, its account and routing number and to whom payments should be made payable. If
such banking information changes, each Party shall provide the other Party at least sixty (60) days’ written
notice of the change and such notice shall include the new banking information. If a Party receives multiple
invoices which are payable on the same date, such Party may remit one payment for the sum of all amounts
payable to the other Party’s bank. Each Party shall provide the other Party with a contact person for the
handling of payment questions or problems.
78
Page 89 of 354

XXVI.4 Late Payment Charges. If either Party fails to remit payment for any charges for
services by the Bill Due Date, or if a payment or any portion of a payment is received by either Party after
the Bill Due Date, or if a payment or any portion of a payment is received in funds which are not
immediately available to the other Party as of the Bill Due Date (individually and collectively, “Past Due”),
then a late payment charge shall be assessed. Past Due amounts shall accrue interest as provided in Section
26.6. Any late payment charges assessed on Disputed Amounts shall be paid or credited, as the case may
be, as provided in Section 27.2.2. In no event, however, shall interest be assessed on any previously
assessed late payment charges.
XXVI.5 Adjustments.
XXVI.5.1 A Party shall promptly reimburse or credit the other Party for any charges that
should not have been billed to the other Party as provided in this Agreement. Such reimbursements shall
be set forth in the appropriate section of the invoice.
XXVI.5.2 A Party shall bill the other Party for any charges that should have been billed
to the other Party as provided in this Agreement, but have not been billed to the other Party (“Underbilled
Charges”); provided, however, that, except as provided in Article XXVII, the Billing Party shall not bill
for Underbilled Charges which were incurred more than one (1) year prior to the date that the Billing Party
transmits a bill for any Underbilled Charges. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Requesting Carrier shall not
be liable for any Underbilled Charges for which Customer Usage Data was not furnished by Ameritech to
Requesting Carrier within ten (10) months of the date such usage was incurred.
XXVI.6 Interest on Unpaid Amounts. Any undisputed amounts not paid when due shall accrue
interest from the date such amounts were due at the lesser of (i) one and one-half percent (1½%) per month
and (ii) the highest rate of interest that may be charged under Applicable Law, compounded daily from the
number of days from the Bill Due Date to and including the date that payment is actually made and available.
ARTICLE XXVII
AUDIT RIGHTS, DISPUTED AMOUNTS
AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
XXVII.1 Audit Rights.
XXVII.1.1 Subject to the restrictions set forth in Article XX and except as may be
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, a Party (“Auditing Party”) may audit the other Party’s
(“Audited Party”) books, records, data and other documents, as provided herein, once annually
(commencing on the Service Start Date) for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of Audited Party’s
billing and invoicing of the services provided hereunder. The scope of the audit shall be limited to the period
which is the shorter of (i) the period subsequent to the last day of the period covered by the Audit which
was last performed (or if no audit has been performed, the Service Start Date) and (ii) the twelve (12)
month period immediately preceding the date the Audited Party received notice of such requested audit,
79
Page 90 of 354

but in any event not prior to the Service Start Date. Such audit shall begin no fewer than thirty (30) days
after Audited Party receives a written notice requesting an audit and shall be completed no later than thirty
(30) days after the start of such audit. Such audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor acceptable
to both Parties. The Parties shall select an auditor by the thirtieth day following Audited Party’s receipt of
a written audit notice. Auditing Party shall cause the independent auditor to execute a nondisclosure
agreement in a form agreed upon by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Auditing Party may
audit Audited Party’s books, records and documents more than once annually if the previous audit found
previously uncorrected net variances or errors in invoices in Audited Party’s favor with an aggregate value
of at least two percent (2%) of the amounts payable by Auditing Party for audited services provided during
the period covered by the audit.
XXVII.1.2 Each audit shall be conducted on the premises of the Audited Party during
normal business hours. Audited Party shall cooperate fully in any such audit and shall provide the
independent auditor reasonable access to any and all appropriate Audited Party employees and books,
records and other documents reasonably necessary to assess the accuracy of Audited Party’s bills. No
Party shall have access to the data of the other Party, but shall rely upon summary results provided by the
independent auditor. Audited Party may redact from the books, records and other documents provided
to the independent auditor any confidential Audited Party information that reveals the identity of other
Customers of Audited Party. Each Party shall maintain reports, records and data relevant to the billing of
any services that are the subject matter of this Agreement for a period of not less than twenty-four (24)
months after creation thereof, unless a longer period is required by Applicable Law.
XXVII.1.3 If any audit confirms any undercharge or overcharge, then Audited Party shall
(i) for any overpayment promptly correct any billing error, including making refund of any overpayment by
Auditing Party in the form of a credit on the invoice for the first full billing cycle after the Parties have agreed
upon the accuracy of the audit results and (ii) for any undercharge caused by the actions of or failure to act
by the Audited Party, immediately compensate Auditing Party for such undercharge, in each case with
interest at the lesser of (x) one and one-half (1½%) percent per month and (y) the highest rate of interest
that may be charged under Applicable Law, compounded daily, for the number of days from the date on
which such undercharge or overcharge originated until the date on which such credit is issued or payment
is made and available, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Requesting Carrier shall not be
liable for any Underbilled Charges for which Customer Usage Data was not furnished by Ameritech to
Requesting Carrier within ten (10) months of the date such usage was incurred.
XXVII.1.4 Audits shall be at Auditing Party’s expense, subject to reimbursement by
Audited Party in the event that an audit finds, and the Parties subsequently verify, adjustment in the charges
or in any invoice paid or payable by Auditing Party hereunder by an amount that is, on an annualized basis,
greater than two percent (2%) of the aggregate charges for the audited services during the period covered
by the audit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the Audited Party’s reimbursement
obligations exceed the amount of any adjustments in charges.
80
Page 91 of 354

XXVII.1.5 Any disputes concerning audit results shall be referred to the Parties’ respective
responsible personnel for informal resolution. If these individuals cannot resolve the dispute within thirty
(30) days of the referral, either Party may request in writing that an additional audit shall be conducted by
an independent auditor acceptable to both Parties, subject to the requirements set out in Section 27.1.1.
Any additional audit shall be at the requesting Party’s expense.
XXVII.2 Disputed Amounts.
XXVII.2.1 If any portion of an amount due to a Party (the “Billing Party”) under this
Agreement is subject to a bona fide dispute between the Parties, the Party billed (the “Non-Paying
Party”) shall, prior to the Bill Due Date, give written notice to the Billing Party of the amounts it disputes
(“Disputed Amounts”) and include in such written notice the specific details and reasons for disputing
each item; provided, however, a failure to provide such notice by that date shall not preclude a Party from
subsequently challenging billed charges. The Non-Paying Party shall pay when due (i) all undisputed
amounts to the Billing Party, and (ii) all Disputed Amounts into an interest bearing escrow account with a
third party escrow agent mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
provided in Section 27.1, a Party shall be entitled to dispute only those charges for which the Bill Due Date
was within the immediately preceding twelve (12) months of the date on which the other Party received
notice of such Disputed Amounts.
XXVII.2.2 Disputed Amounts in escrow shall be subject to interest charges as set forth
in Section 26.4. If the Non-Paying Party disputes charges and the dispute is resolved in favor of such
Non-Paying Party, (i) the Billing Party shall credit the invoice of the Non-Paying Party for the amount of
the Disputed Amounts along with any applicable interest charges assessed no later than the second Bill Due
Date after the resolution of the Dispute and (ii) the escrowed Disputed Amounts shall be released to the
Non-Paying Party, together with any accrued interest thereon. Accordingly, if a Non-Paying Party disputes
charges and the dispute regarding the Disputed Amounts is resolved in favor of the Billing Party, (x) the
escrowed Disputed Amounts and any accrued interest thereon shall be released to the Billing Party and (y)
the Non-Paying Party shall no later than the second Bill Due Date after the resolution of the dispute
regarding the Disputed Amounts pay the Billing Party the difference between the amount of accrued interest
such Billing Party received from the escrow disbursement and the amount of interest charges such Billing
Party is entitled pursuant to Section 26.6.
XXVII.2.3 If the Parties are unable to resolve the issues related to the Disputed Amounts
in the normal course of business within thirty (30) days after delivery to the Billing Party of notice of the
Disputed Amounts, each of the Parties shall appoint a designated representative who has authority to settle
the Disputed Amounts and who is at a higher level of management than the persons with direct responsibility
for administration of this Agreement. The designated representatives shall meet as often as they reasonably
deem necessary in order to discuss the Disputed Amounts and negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve
such Disputed Amounts. The specific format for such discussions will be left to the discretion of the
designated representatives, however all reasonable requests for relevant information made by one Party to
the other Party shall be honored.

XXVII.2.4 If the Parties are unable to resolve issues related to the Disputed Amounts
within thirty (30) days after the Parties’ appointment of designated representatives pursuant to Section
27.2.3, then either Party may file a complaint with the Commission to resolve such issues or proceed with
any other remedy available to the Parties. The Commission or the FCC or a court of competent jurisdiction
may direct payment of any or all Disputed Amounts (including any accrued interest) thereon or additional
amounts awarded plus applicable late fees, to be paid to either Party.
XXVII.2.5 The Parties agree that all negotiations pursuant to this Section 27.2 shall remain
confidential in accordance with Article XX and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations
for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence.
XXVII.3 Failure to Pay Undisputed Amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if the Non-Paying Party fails to (i) pay any undisputed amounts by the Bill Due Date, (ii)
pay the disputed portion of a past due bill into an interest-bearing escrow account, (iii) give written notice
to the Billing Party of the specific details and reasons for disputing amounts, (iv) pay any revised deposit
or (iv) make a payment in accordance with the terms of any mutually agreed upon payment arrangement,
the Billing Party may, in addition to exercising any other rights or remedies it may have under Applicable
Law, provide written demand to the Non-Paying Party for failing to comply with the foregoing. If the Non-
Paying Party does not satisfy the written demand within five (5) Business Days of receipt, the Billing Party
may exercise any, or all, of the following options:
(a) assess a late payment charge and where appropriate, a dishonored check charge;
(b) require provision of a deposit or increase an existing deposit pursuant to a revised
deposit request;
(c) refuse to accept new, or complete pending, orders; and/or
(d) discontinue service.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Billing Party’s exercise of (i) any of the
above options shall not delay or relieve the Non-Paying Party’s obligation to pay all charges on each and
every invoice on or before the applicable Bill Due Date and (ii) subsections (c) and (d) above shall exclude
any affected order or service from any applicable performance interval or Performance Benchmark. Once
disconnection has occurred, additional charges may apply.
XXVII.4 Dispute Escalation and Resolution. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
dispute, controversy or claim (individually and collectively, a “Dispute”) arising under this Agreement shall
be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 27.4. In the event of a Dispute
between the Parties relating to this Agreement and upon the written request of either Party, each of the
Parties shall appoint within five (5) Business Days after a Party’s receipt of such request a designated
82
Page 93 of 354

representative who has authority to settle the Dispute and who is at a higher level of management than the
persons with direct responsibility for administration of this Agreement. The designated representatives shall
meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary in order to discuss the Dispute and negotiate in good faith
in an effort to resolve such Dispute. The specific format for such discussions will be left to the discretion
of the designated representatives, however, all reasonable requests for relevant information made by one
Party to the other Party shall be honored. If the Parties are unable to resolve issues related to a Dispute
within thirty (30) days after the Parties’ appointment of designated representatives as set forth above, either
Party may seek any relief it is entitled to under Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Parties permit the pending of a Dispute to disrupt service to any Requesting Carrier Customer or
Ameritech Customer.
XXVII.5 Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Article XXVII shall not be
construed to prevent either Party from seeking and obtaining temporary equitable remedies, including
temporary restraining orders, if, in its judgment, such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. Despite
any such action, the Parties will continue to participate in good faith in the dispute resolution procedures
described in this Article XXVII.

Page 96 of 354

providing Party a proper resale tax exemption certificate as authorized or required by statute or regulation

General Information on Blocking
• Optional Blocking is available to consumer and business Customers that want the capability to
block direct calls to Provider’s services covered in this Schedule.
• Customers attempting to reach programming from accounts where blocking has been established
will reach a recording informing them that the call cannot be completed.
• Access to 976 services is prohibited by tariff from providing Group Access Bridging (GAB)
services whereby a Customer can be connected to parties other than the IP for the purpose of
establishing a conference call.
• Collect, operator assisted, calling card, and person-to-person calls to 976 are not allowed.
• Collect and person-to-person calls to CPP/C and CPP/P are not allowed.
• Calls from WATS, hotel/motel, Ameritech Public/semi-public telephones and lines with Call
Blocking will not be allowed to 976 service.
• 976 Call Blocking should not be added to accounts that have Consumer/Business Toll Restrictions.
• Call Blocking will be provided only where CO facilities permit.
• Call Blocking may not be limited to specific programs.
• Call Blocking does not block calls to other telephone companies’ numbers.

Subject to Section 1.1 of Schedule 9.5, Ameritech shall allow Requesting Carrier access to the
Unbundled Local Loop types described in this Schedule 9.2.1 unbundled from Local Switching and
Interoffice Transmission Facilities, and according to the terms and conditions contained in this Schedule
9.2.1.
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Ameritech Illinois agrees to provide CLEC with access to UNEs (including the unbundled
xDSL Capable Loop offerings) in accordance with the rates, terms and conditions set forth
in this xDSL Attachment and the general terms and conditions applicable to UNEs under
this Agreement, for CLEC to use in conjunction with its desired xDSL technologies and
equipment to provide xDSL services to its end user customers.
1.2 Nothing in this Attachment shall constitute a waiver by either Party of any positions it may
have taken or will take in any pending regulatory or judicial proceeding or any subsequent
interconnection agreement negotiations. This Attachment also shall not constitute a
concession or admission by either Party and shall not foreclose either Party from taking any
position in the future in any forum addressing any of the matters set forth herein.
2.0 Definitions
2.1 For purposes of this Attachment, a "loop" is defined as a transmission facility between a
distribution frame (or its equivalent) in a central office and the loop demarcation point at an
end user customer premises.
2.2 For purposes of this Attachment, a "subloop" is defined as any portion of the loop from
Ameritech Illinois's F1/F2 interface to the demarcation point at the customer premise that
can be accessed at a terminal in Ameritech Illinois's outside plant. An accessible terminal
is a point on the loop where technicians can access the wire or fiber within the cable
without removing a splice case to reach the wire within. The Parties recognize that this is
only one form of subloop (defined as the F1/F2 interface to the customer premise) as set
forth in the FCC's UNE Remand Order. Additional subloop types may be negotiated and
agreed to by the Parties consistent with the UNE Remand Order.

2.3 The term "Digital Subscriber Line" ("DSL") describes various technologies and services.
The "x" in "xDSL" is a place holder for the various types of DSL services, including, but
not limited to ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), HDSL (High-Speed Digital
Subscriber Line), IDSL (ISDN Digital Subscriber Line), SDSL (Symmetrical Digital
Subscriber Line), UDSL (Universal Digital Subscriber Line), VDSL (Very High-Speed
Digital Subscriber Line), and RADSL (Rate-Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line)A "DSL-
capable loop" is a loop that supports the transmission of DSL technologies
2.4 A "DSL-Capable Loop" is a loop that supports the transmission of DSL technologies.
2.5 A loop technology that is "presumed acceptable for deployment" is one that either complies
with existing industry standards, has been successfully deployed by any carrier in any state
without significantly degrading the performance of other services, or has been approved by
the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), any state commission, or an industry
standards body.
2.6 A "non-standard xDSL-based technology" is a loop technology that is not presumed
acceptable for deployment under Section 2.5 of this Attachment. Deployment of non-
standard xDSL-based technologies are allowed and encouraged by this Agreement.
3.0 General Terms and Conditions Relating to Unbundled xDSL-Capable Loops
3.1 Ameritech Illinois is not in any way permitted to limit xDSL capable loops in favor of
provisioning ADSL.
3.2 Ameritech Illinois will not impose limitations on the transmission speeds of xDSL services.
Ameritech Illinois will not restrict the CLECs services or technologies to a level at or
below those provided by Ameritech Illinois.
3.3 Ameritech Illinois will provide a loop capable of supporting a technology presumed
acceptable for deployment or non-standard xDSL technology as defined in this
Attachment.
3.4 Ameritech Illinois shall not deny a CLEC's request to deploy any loop technology that is presumed
acceptable for deployment, or one that is addressed in Section 4.5 of this Attachment, unless it has
demonstrated to the Commission that CLEC's deployment of the specific loop technology will
significantly degrade the performance of other advanced services or traditional voice band services
in accordance with FCC orders. Ameritech Illinois will provide CLEC with notice prior to seeking
relief from the Commission under this Section.
Sch. 9.2.1- 2
Page 151 of 354

3.5 In the event the CLEC wishes to introduce a technology that has been approved by another state
commission or the FCC, or successfully deployed elsewhere, the CLEC will provide
documentation describing that action to Ameritech Illinois and the Commission before or at the time
of their request to deploy that technology in Texas. The documentation should include the date of
approval or deployment, any limitations included in its deployment, and a sworn attestation that the
deployment did not significantly degrade the performance of other services. The terms of this
paragraph do not apply during the Trial Period referenced in Section 4.5 below.
3.6 Parties to this Attachment agree that unresolved disputes arising under this Attachment will be
handled under the Dispute Resolution procedures set forth in this Agreement.
3.7 Liability
3.7.1 Each Party, whether a CLEC or Ameritech Illinois, agrees that should it cause any non-
standard xDSL technologies to be deployed or used in connection with or on Ameritech
Illinois facilities, that Party ("Indemnifying Party") will pay all costs associated with any
damage, service interruption or other telecommunications service degradation, or damage
to the other Party's ("Indemnitee") facilities.
3.7.2 For any technology, CLEC's use of any Ameritech Illinois network element, or of its own
equipment or facilities in conjunction with any Ameritech Illinois network element, will not
materially interfere with or impair service over any facilities of Ameritech Illinois, its affiliated
companies or connecting and concurring carriers involved in Ameritech Illinois services,
cause damage to Ameritech Illinois's plant, impair the privacy of any communications
carried over Ameritech Illinois's facilities or create hazards to employees or the public.
Upon reasonable written notice and after a reasonable opportunity to cure, Ameritech
Illinois may discontinue or refuse service if CLEC violates this provision, provided that such
termination of service will be limited to CLEC's use of the element(s) causing the violation.
Ameritech Illinois will not disconnect the elements causing the violation if, after receipt of
written notice and opportunity to cure, the CLEC demonstrates that their use of the
network element is not the cause of the network harm. If Ameritech Illinois does not
believe the CLEC has made the sufficient showing of harm, or if CLEC contests the basis
for the disconnection, either Party must first submit the matter to dispute resolution under
the Dispute Resolution Procedures set forth in this Agreement. Any claims of network
harm by Ameritech Illinois must be supported with specific and verifiable supporting
information.

4.0 Unbundled xDSL-Capable Loop Offerings
4.1 DSL-Capable Loops: For each of the loop types described in Sections 4.1.1 – 4.1.5
below, CLEC will, at the time of ordering, notify Ameritech Illinois as to the type of PSD
mask CLEC intends to use and will notify Ameritech Illinois if and when a change in PSD
mask is made.
4.1.1 2-Wire xDSL Loop: A 2-wire xDSL loop for purposes of this section, is a loop that
supports the transmission of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies. The loop is a
dedicated transmission facility between a distribution frame, or its equivalent, in a Ameritech
Illinois central office and the network interface device at the customer premises. A copper
loop used for such purposes will meet basic electrical standards such as metallic
conductivity and capacitive and resistive balance, and will not include load coils or
excessive bridged tap (bridged tap in excess of 2,500 feet in length). The loop may retain
existing repeaters at CLEC's option. The loop cannot be "categorized" based on loop
length and limitations cannot be placed on the length of xDSL loops. A portion of an xDSL
loop may be provisioned using fiber optic facilities and necessary electronics to provide
service in certain situations.The rates set forth in Section 11.1 for the 2-Wire Analog Loop
shall apply to this 2-Wire xDSL Loop.
4.1.2 2-Wire Digital Loop (e.g., ISDN/IDSL): A 2-Wire Digital Loop for purposes of this
Section is 160 Kbps and supports Basic Rate ISDN (BRI) digital exchange services. The
2-Wire Digital Loop 160 Kbps supports usable bandwidth up to 160 Kbps. The rates for
the 2-Wire Digital Loop are set forth in Section 11.1 below.
4.1.3 4-Wire xDSL Loop: A 4-wire xDSL loop for purposes of this section, is a loop that
supports the transmission of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies. The loop is a
dedicated transmission facility between a distribution frame, or its equivalent, in a Ameritech
Illinois central office and the network interface device at the customer premises. A copper
loop used for such purposes will meet basic electrical standards such as metallic
conductivity and capacitive and resistive balance, and will not include load coils or
excessive bridged tap (bridge tap in excess of 2,500 feet in length). The loop may retain
existing repeaters at CLEC's option. The loop cannot be "categorized" based on loop
length and limitations cannot be placed on the length of xDSL loops. A portion of an xDSL
loop may be provisioned using fiber optic facilities and necessary electronics to provide
service in certain situations. The rates set forth in Section 11.1 for the 4-Wire Analog Loop
shall apply to this 4-Wire xDSL Loop.
Sch. 9.2.1- 5
Page 154 of 354

4.1.4 4-Wire Digital Loop: A 4-Wire Digital Loop for purposes of this Section is a 1.544 Mbps
loop that will support DS1 service including Primary Rate ISDN (PRI). The 4-Wire Digital
Loop 1.544 Mbps supports usable bandwidth up to 1.544 Mbps. The rates for the 4-Wire
Digital Loop are set forth in Section 11.1 below.
4.1.5 Sub-Loop: In locations where Ameritech Illinois has deployed (1) Digital Loop Carrier
("DLC") systems and an uninterrupted copper loop is replaced with a fiber segment or
shared copper in the distribution section of the loop; (2) Digital Added Main Line
("DAML") technology to derive two voice-grade POTS circuits from a single copper pair;
or (3) entirely fiber optic facilities to the end user, Ameritech Illinois will make the following
options available to CLEC. In these three situations above, where spare copper facilities
are available, and the facilities meet the necessary technical requirements for the provision
of xDSL and allow CLEC to offer the same level of quality for advanced services, CLEC
has the option of requesting that Ameritech Illinois make copper facilities available (subject
to Section 4.2 below). In addition, CLEC has the option of collocating a Digital Subscriber
Line Access Multiplexer ("DSLAM") in Ameritech Illinois's RT at the fiber/copper interface
point, pursuant to collocation terms and conditions. When CLEC collocates its DSLAM
at Ameritech Illinois's RT, Ameritech Illinois will provide CLEC with unbundled access to
subloops to allow CLEC to access the copper wire portion of the loop. The xDSL
subloops (consistent with Section 2.2 above) are defined as outlined in Sections 4.1.1
through 4.1.4 above, but only include the F2/distribution portion of the loop. Where CLEC
is unable to install a DSLAM at the RT or obtain spare copper loops necessary to
provision an xDSL service, and Ameritech Illinois has placed a DSLAM in the RT,
Ameritech Illinois must unbundle and provide access to its DSLAM. Ameritech Illinois is
relieved of this requirement to unbundle its DSLAM only if it permits CLEC to collocate
its DSLAMs in the RT on the same terms and conditions that apply to its own DSLAM.
The unbundling requirement with respect to DSLAMS would attach to such equipment
transferred to Ameritech Illinois's advanced services affiliate. Sub loop pricing may be
found in Section 11.1 below.
4.2 Ameritech Illinois shall be under no obligation to provision xDSL-capable Loops in any instance
where physical facilities are not available. This shall not apply where physical facilities are availible,
but require conditioning. In that event, CLEC will be given the opportunity to evaluate the
parameters of the xDSL service to be provided, and determine whether and what type of
conditioning shall be performed at the request of the CLEC.
Sch. 9.2.1- 6
Page 155 of 354

4.3 Ameritech Illinois will not impose limitations on the transmission speeds of xDSL services.
Ameritech Illinois will not restrict the CLEC's services or technologies to a level at or below those
provided by Ameritech Illinois. For each loop, CLEC should at the time of ordering notify
Ameritech Illinois as to the type of PSD mask CLEC intends to use, and if and when a change in
PSD mask is made, CLEC will notify Ameritech Illinois. Likewise, Ameritech Illinois should
disclose to CLEC information with respect to the number of loops using advanced services
technology within the binder and type of technology deployed on those loops. Ameritech Illinois
will use this information for the sole purpose of maintaining an inventory of advanced services
present in the cable sheath. If the technology does not fit within a national standard PSD mask,
CLEC shall provide Ameritech Illinois with a technical description of the technology (including
power mask) for the inventory purposes. Ameritech Illinois will keep such information confidential
and will take all measures to ensure that CLEC deployment information is neither intentionally nor
inadvertently revealed to any part of Ameritech Illinois's retail operations, to any affiliate(s), or to
any other CLEC without prior authorization from CLEC. Additional information on the use of PSD
masks can be found in Section 9.1 below.
4.4 In the event that Ameritech Illinois rejects a request by CLEC for provisioning of advanced
services, including, but not limited to denial due to fiber, DLC, or DAML facility issues, Ameritech
Illinois will disclose to the requesting CLEC information with respect to the number of loops using
advanced services technology within the binder and type of technology deployed on those loops,
including the specific reason for the denial, within 48 hours of the denial. In no event shall the denial
be based on loop length. If there is any dispute between the Parties with respect to this Section,
Ameritech Illinois will not deny the loop (subject to Section 3.4 above), but will continue to
provision loops until the dispute is resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution procedures
set forth in this Agreement.
4.5 Ameritech Illinois will not deny a requesting CLEC's right to deploy new xDSL technologies that
do not conform to the national standards and have not yet been approved by a standards body (or
otherwise authorized by the FCC, any state commission or which have not been successfully
deployed by any carrier without significantly degrading the performance of other services) if the
requesting CLEC can demonstrate to the Commission that the loop technology will not significantly
degrade the performance of other advanced services or traditional voice band services.
4.5.1 Upon request by CLEC, Ameritech Illinois will cooperate in the testing and deployment of
new xDSL technologies or may direct the CLEC, at CLEC's expense, to a third party
laboratory of CLEC's choice for such evaluation.
4.5.2 If it is demonstrated that the new xDSL technology will not significantly degrade the other
advanced services or traditional voice based services, Ameritech Illinois will provide a loop
to support the new technology for CLEC as follows:
Sch. 9.2.1- 7
Page 156 of 354

4.5.2.1If the technology requires the use of a 2-Wire or 4-Wire xDSL loop [as defined in this
Attachment] , then Ameritech Illinois will provide with the xDSL loop at the same rates
listed for a2-Wire or 4-Wire xDSL loop and associated loop conditioning as needed.
Ameritech Illinois's ordering procedures will remain the same as for its 2-Wire or 4-Wire
xDSL loop even though the xDSL loop is now capable of supporting a new xDSL
technology.
4.5.2.2In the unlikely event that a new xDSL technology requires a loop type that differs from that
of a 2-Wire or 4-Wire loop [as defined in this Attachment], the Parties shall expend diligent
efforts to arrive at an agreement as to the rates, terms and conditions for an unbundled loop
capable of supporting the proposed xDSL technology. If negotiations fail, any dispute
between the Parties concerning the rates, terms and conditions for an unbundled loop
capable of supporting the proposed xDSL technology shall be resolved pursuant to the
dispute resolution process provided for in this Agreement.
4.6 Technologies deployed on copper loops must be in compliance with applicable national industry
standards; provided, however, CLEC can deploy technologies under Section 4.5 above for which
applicable national standards have not been adopted.
4.7 If Ameritech Illinois or another CLEC claims that a service is significantly degrading the
performance of other advanced services or traditional voice band services, then Ameritech Illinois
or that other CLEC must notify the causing carrier and allow that carrier a reasonable opportunity
to correct the problem. Any claims of network harm must be supported with specific and verifiable
supporting information. In the event that Ameritech Illinois or a CLEC demonstrates to the
Commission that a deployed technology is significantly degrading the performance of other
advanced services or traditional voice band services, the carrier deploying the technology shall
discontinue deployment of that technology and migrate its customers to technologies that will not
significantly degrade the performance of other such services.
4.8 Ameritech Illinois shall not impose its own standards for provisioning xDSL services, through
Technical Publications or otherwise, until and unless approved by the Commission or the FCC prior
to use.
4.9 Ameritech Illinois shall not employ internal technical standards, through Technical Publications or
otherwise, for its own retail xDSL that would adversely affect wholesale xDSL services or xDSL
providers.
Sch. 9.2.1- 8

Operational Support Systems: Loop Make-Up Information and Ordering
5.1 General: Ameritech Illinois will provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access, whether that access
is available by electronic or manual means, to its OSS functions as stated in the SBC Plan of
Record filed with the FCC on December 7, 1999, or any subsequent revisions or additions to the
Plan. This provision will not be construed as an admission by CLEC that the Plan of Record is
sufficient. In the interim, manual loop make-up data will be provided as set forth below. In
accordance with the FCC's UNE Remand order, CLEC will be given nondiscriminatory access to
the same OSS functions that Ameritech Illinois is providing any other CLEC and/or Ameritech
Illinois or its advanced services affiliate.
5.2 Loop Pre-Qualification: Subject to 5.1 above, Ameritech Illinois's pre-qualification system will
provide a near-real time response to CLEC queries. Until replaced with OSS access as provided
in 5.1, Ameritech Illinois will provide mechanized access to a loop length indicator via Verigate and
Datagate for use with xDSL-based or other advanced services The loop length indicator is an
indication of the approximate loop length, based on a 26-gauge equivalent and is calculated on the
basis of Distribution Area distance from the central office. This is an optional service to the CLEC.
5.3 Loop Qualification: Subject to 5.1 above, Ameritech Illinois will develop and deploy enhancements
to its existing Datagate and EDI interfaces that will allow CLECs, as well as Ameritech Illinois's
retail operations or its advanced service subsidiary, to have real-time electronic access as a
preordering function to the loop makeup information, subject to the following:
5.3.1 For loops ordered under 12,000 feet in length, Ameritech Illinois will provide a One-Step
Process so that no loop qualification shall be required;
5.3.2 In addition, no loop qualification shall be required for the 2-Wire Digital Loop (e.g.,
ISDN/IDSL) referenced in Section 4.1.2 above; and
5.3.3 If a CLEC elects to have Ameritech Illinois provide loop makeup information through a
manual process for xDSL loops not addressed in Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 above, then the
interval will be 3-5 business days, or the interval provided to Ameritech Illinois's affiliate,
whichever is less.
5.4 Loop makeup data should include the following: (a) the actual loop length; (b) the length by gauge;
and (c) the presence of repeaters, load coils, or bridged taps; and shall include, if noted on the
individual loop record, (d) the total length of bridged taps, load coils, and repeaters; (e) the
presence of pair-gain devices, DLC, and/or DAML, and (f) the presence of disturbers in the same
and/or adjacent binder groups.
Sch. 9.2.1- 9
Page 158 of 354

5.4.1 In accordance with the UNE Remand Order, where Ameritech Illinois has not compiled
loop qualification information for itself, Ameritech Illinois is not required to conduct a plant
inventory and construct a database on behalf of requesting carriers. If Ameritech Illinois has
manual access to this sort of information for itself, or any affiliate, Ameritech Illinois will
provide access to it to CLEC on a non-discriminatory basis. To the extent Ameritech
Illinois has access to this information in an electronic format, that same format should be
made available to CLEC via an electronic interface. The Parties will meet and agree to the
appropriate rate for such information if not included in this Agreement. If an agreement
cannot be reached, Ameritech Illinois will provide such information and the Parties will
resolve the matter through the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Agreement.
6.0 Provisioning
6.1 CLEC shall designate, at the CLEC's sole option, what loop conditioning Ameritech Illinois
is to perform in provisioning the xDSL loop or subloop on the loop order. Conditioning
may be ordered on loop(s) or subloop(s) of any length at the Loop conditioning rates set
forth in Section 11.4. The loop or subloop will be provisioned to meet basic metallic and
electrical characteristics such as electrical conductivity and capacitive and resistance
balance.
6.2 The provisioning and installation interval for a xDSL-capable loop, where no conditioning
is requested (including outside plant rearrangements that involve moving a workings service
to an alternate pair as the only possible solution to provide a DSL-capable loop), on orders
for 1-20 loops per order or per end-user location, will be 5 business days, or the
provisioning and installation interval applicable to Ameritech Illinois's tariffed xDSL-based
services, or its affiliate's, whichever is less. The provisioning and installation intervals for
xDSL-capable loops where conditioning is requested or outside plant rearrangements are
necessary, as defined above), on orders for 1-20 loops per order or per end-user
customer location, will be 10 business days, or the provisioning and installation interval
applicable to Ameritech Illinois's tariffed xDSL-based services or its affiliate's xDSL-based
services where conditioning is required, whichever is less. Orders for more than 20 loops
per order or per end-user location, where no conditioning is requested, will have a
provisioning and installation interval of 15 business days, or as agreed upon by the Parties.
Orders for more than 20 loops per order which require conditioning will have a
provisioning and installation interval agreed by the parties in each instance. These
provisioning intervals are applicable to every xDSL loop regardless of the loop length. The
Parties will meet to negotiate and agree upon subloop provisioning intervals.
6.3 Subsequent to the initial order for a xDSL capable loop or subloop, additional conditioning
may be requested on such loop at the rates set forth below and the applicable service order
Sch. 9.2.1- 10
Page 159 of 354

charges will apply; provided, however, when requests to add or modify conditioning are
received within twenty-four (24) hours of the initial order for a xDSL-capable loop, no
service order charges shall be assessed, but the due date may be adjusted as necessary as
agreed to by the parties. The provisioning interval for additional requests for conditioning
pursuant to this subsection will be the same as set forth above.
6.4 The CLEC, at its sole option, may request shielded cross-connects for central office wiring
at rates set forth herein.
6.5 Ameritech Illinois shall keep CLEC deployment information confidential from Ameritech
Illinois's retail operations, any Ameritech Illinois affiliate, or any other CLEC.
7.0 Acceptance Testing
7.1 Ameritech Illinois and CLEC agree to implement Cooperative Acceptance Testing for
xDSL loop delivery.
7.2 Should CLEC desire Cooperative Acceptance Testing, CLEC shall request such testing
on a per xDSL loop basis upon issuance of the Local Service Request (LSR). Cooperative
Acceptance Testing will be conducted at the time of installation of the service request.
7.3 Acceptance Testing Procedure:
7.3.1 Upon delivery of a loop to/for CLEC, Ameritech Illinois's field technician will call
the Local Operations Center (LOC) and the LOC technician will call a toll free
CLEC number to initiate performance of a series of cooperative tests.
7.3.1.1Except for ISDN loops that are provisioned through repeaters or digital
loop carriers, the test requires the Ameritech Illinois field technician to
provide a solid short across the tip and ring of the circuit and then open
circuit the loop.
7.3.1.2For ISDN (very low band symmetric) loops that are provisioned through
repeaters or digital loop carriers, the Ameritech Illinois field technician will
not perform a short or open circuit.
7.3.2 If the loop passes Cooperative Acceptance Test for loop continuity test parameters
defined by this Agreement for xDSL loops, CLEC will provide Ameritech Illinois
with a confirmation number and Ameritech Illinois will complete the order. CLEC
Sch. 9.2.1- 11
Page 160 of 354

will be billed for the Cooperative Acceptance Test as specified below under
Acceptance Testing Billing.
7.3.3 If the Cooperative Acceptance Test fails loop continuity test parameters defined
by this Agreement for xDSL loops, the LOC technician will take reasonable steps
to immediately resolve the problem with CLEC on the line including, but not limited
to, calling the central office to perform work at such office. If the problem cannot
be quickly resolved, Ameritech Illinois will release the CLEC technician, and
perform the work necessary to correct the situation. Once the loop is correctly
provisioned, Ameritech Illinois will contact CLEC to repeat the Cooperative
Acceptance Test. When the aforementioned test parameters are met, CLEC will
provide Ameritech Illinois with a confirmation number and Ameritech Illinois will
complete the order. Ameritech Illinois will not complete an order that fails
Acceptance Testing.
7.3.4 Since CLEC's test equipment cannot send signals through repeaters or digital loop
carriers, CLEC will accept ISDN loops without testing the complete circuit.
Consequently, Ameritech Illinois agrees that should CLEC open a trouble ticket
on such a loop within ten (10) business days (that is the fault of Ameritech Illinois),
Ameritech Illinois will adjust CLEC's bill and refund the recurring charge of such
a loop until Ameritech Illinois has resolved the problem and closed the trouble
ticket.
7.3.5 Ameritech Illinois will be relieved of the obligation to perform Acceptance Testing
on a particular loop and will, assume acceptance of the loop by CLEC when
CLEC places the LOC on hold for over ten (10) minutes. In that case, Ameritech
Illinois may close the order utilizing existing procedures. If no trouble ticket is
opened on that loop within 24 hours, Ameritech Illinois may bill CLEC as if the
Acceptance Test had been completed and the loop accepted, subject to Section
B below. If, however, a trouble ticket is opened on the loop within 24 hours and
the trouble resulted from Ameritech Illinois error, CLEC will be credited for the
cost of the acceptance test. Additionally, CLEC may subsequently request and
Ameritech Illinois will perform testing of such a loop under the terms and conditions
of a repair request. If such loop is found by Ameritech Illinois to not meet loop
continuity test parameters defined herein, Ameritech Illinois will not charge for
acceptance testing done on the repair call.
7.3.6 If a trouble ticket is opened within 24 hours of a loop order completion, and the
trouble is determined to be Ameritech Illinois's error, then the loop will not be
Sch. 9.2.1- 12
Page 161 of 354

counted as a successful completion for the purposes of the calculations discussed
in Section B.1 below.
7.3.7 Both Parties will work together to implement Cooperative Acceptance Testing
procedures that are efficient and effective. If the Parties mutually agree to
additional testing, procedures and/or standards not covered by this Agreement or
any commission-ordered tariff, the Parties will negotiate terms and conditions to
implement such additional testing, procedures and/or standards. Additional
charges may apply if any agreed-to changes require Ameritech Illinois to expend
additional time and expense.
7.4 Acceptance Testing Billing
7.4.1 CLEC will be billed for Acceptance Testing upon the effective date of this
Agreement for loops that are installed correctly by the committed interval without
the benefit of corrective action due to acceptance testing. In any calendar month
after the first sixty (60) days of the agreement, CLEC may indicate that it believes
that Ameritech Illinois is failing to install loops with loop continuity and ordered
conditioning eighty percent (80%) of the time within the committed intervals.
7.4.1.1If sampling establishes that Ameritech Illinois is correctly provisioning loops
with continuity and ordered conditioning eighty percent (80%) of the time,
Ameritech Illinois may continue charging for Acceptance Testing for all
loops that are properly installed the first time. If Ameritech Illinois is not
correctly provisioning loops eighty percent (80%) of the time, or greater,
then CLEC will not be billed for Acceptance Testing for the next 90 days.
Immediately after the effective date of this agreement, the Parties will
negotiate in good faith to agree to a method for sampling 100 random
install orders; provided, however, the Parties agree that none of the orders
included in such sampling shall be orders placed within the first thirty (30)
days of CLEC's entry into any Metropolitan Statistical Area ("MSA").
7.4.1.1.1 ISDN Loops that have trouble tickets (that are Ameritech
Illinois's fault) opened within 10 business days will be
considered failures.
7.4.1.1.2 Loops that are successfully installed as a result of corrective
action taken after acceptance testing will be considered
failures.
Sch. 9.2.1- 13
Page 162 of 354

7.4.1.2In any calendar month after the 90 day no charge period, Ameritech
Illinois may request that another random sample of 100 install orders be
reviewed. If the sample determines Ameritech Illinois is provisioning
loops correctly eighty percent (80%) of the time or greater, billing will
resume.
7.4.1.3 Even if Ameritech Illinois is in period which it may bill for Acceptance
Testing, Ameritech Illinois will not bill for the Acceptance Testing for
loop installs that did not pass, the first time, the test parameters defined
by this Agreement for xDSL loops. Ameritech Illinois will not bill for
loop repairs when the repair was Ameritech Illinois problem.
7.4.1.4Beginning November 1, 2000, Ameritech Illinois delivery commitment
changes to 90%.
7.4.2 The charges for Acceptance Testing shall be $33.51 as specifically listed in Section
13.4.8(A) of the commission-ordered FCC Tariff No. 73. CLEC will use the
USOC(s) UBCX+ for basic time. If requested by CLEC, Overtime or Premium
time charges will apply for Acceptance Testing requests in off-hours at overtime
time charges calculated at one and one half times the standard price and premium
time being calculated at two times the standard priceIf the tariff rate changes, the
parties will negotiate in good faith to determine if the tariff rate changes should
apply to acceptance testing.
7.4.3 Repairs
7.4.3.1The parties will negotiate in good faith to arrive at terms and conditions for
acceptance testing on repairs
8.0 Service Quality and Maintenance
8.1 Ameritech Illinois will not guarantee that the local loop(s) ordered will perform as desired
by CLEC for xDSL-based or other advanced services, but will guarantee basic metallic
loop parameters, including continuity and pair balance. CLEC-requested testing by
Ameritech Illinois beyond these parameters will be billed on a time and materials basis at
Access Tariff 73 rates.
8.2 Maintenance, other than assuring loop continuity, line balance, and verifying suitability for
POTS, on unconditioned or partially conditioned loops in excess of 12,000 feet, will only
be provided on a time and material basis as set out elsewhere in this Agreement. On loops
Sch. 9.2.1- 14
Page 163 of 354

where CLEC has requested that no conditioning be performed, Ameritech Illinois's
maintenance will be limited to verifying loop suitability based on POTS design. For loops
having had partial or extensive conditioning performed at CLEC's request, Ameritech
Illinois will verify continuity, the completion of all requested conditioning, and will repair at
no charge to CLEC any gross defects which would be unacceptable based on current
POTS design criteria and which do not result from the loop's modified design.
8.3 Each xDSL-Capable Loop offering provided by Ameritech Illinois to CLEC will be at least
equal in quality and performance as that which Ameritech Illinois provides to itself or to an
affiliate.
9.0 Spectrum Management
9.1 CLEC will advise Ameritech Illinois of the Power Spectral Density ("PSD") mask approved
or proposed by T1.E1 that reflects the service performance parameters of the technology
to be used. The CLEC, at its option and without further disclosure to Ameritech Illinois,
may provide any service compliant with that PSD mask so long as it stays within the
allowed service performance parameters. At the time of ordering a xDSL-capable loop,
CLEC will notify Ameritech Illinois as to the type of PSD mask CLEC intends to use on
the ordering form, and if and when a change in PSD mask is made, CLEC will notify
Ameritech Illinois as set forth in Section 4.3 above. CLEC will abide by standards pertinent
for the designated PSD mask type.
9.2 Ameritech Illinois agrees that as a part of spectrum management, it will maintain an
inventory of the existing services provisioned on the cable. Ameritech Illinois will not use
Selective Feeder Separation (SFS) and will remove any restrictions imposed by Ameritech
Illinois on use of pairs for non-ADSL xDSL services. Ameritech Illinois will not deny any
loops on the basis of binder group management designations or business rules created in
Ameritech Illinois LFACS and LEAD databases or limit the deployment of xDSL services
to certain pair ranges, with the exception of binder groups containing AMI T1 services.
Ameritech Illinois may not segregate xDSL technologies into designated binder groups
without Commission review and approval. Where Ameritech Illinois has already
implemented BGM or reserved loop complements, Ameritech Illinois must open those
binder groups to all xDSL services and all xDSL providers. Ameritech Illinois shall not
deny CLEC a loop based upon spectrum management issues, subject to 9.3 below. In all
cases, Ameritech Illinois will manage the spectrum in a competitively neutral manner
consistent with all relevant industry standards regardless of whether the service is provided
by a CLEC or by Ameritech Illinois, as well as competitively neutral as between different
xDSL services. Where disputes arise, Ameritech Illinois and CLEC will put forth a good
faith effort to resolve such disputes in a timely manner. As a part of the dispute resolution
Sch. 9.2.1- 15
Page 164 of 354

process, Ameritech Illinois will, upon request from a CLEC, disclose within 3-5 business
days information with respect to the number of loops using advanced services technology
within the binder group and the type of technology deployed on those loops so that the
involved parties may examine the deployment of services within the affected loop plant.
9.3 In the event that the FCC or the industry establishes long-term standards and practices and
policies relating to spectrum compatibility and spectrum management that differ from those
established in this Agreement, Ameritech Illinois and CLEC agree to comply with the FCC
and/or industry standards, practices and policies and will establish a mutually agreeable
transition plan and timeframe for achieving and implementing such industry standards,
practices and policies. If there is any dispute between the Parties with respect to this
Section, Ameritech Illinois will not deny the loop (subject to Section 3.4 above), but will
continue to provision loops until the dispute is resolved in accordance with the Dispute
Resolution procedures set forth in this Agreement.
9.4 Within thirty (30) days after general availability of equipment conforming to applicable
industry standards or the mutually agreed upon standards developed by the industry in
conjunction with the Commission or FCC, if Ameritech Illinois and/or CLEC is providing
xDSL technologies deployed under Section 4.0 above, or other advanced services for
which there is no standard, then Ameritech Illinois and/or CLEC must being the process
of bringing its deployed xDSL technologies and equipment into compliance with such
standards at its own expense.
10.0 Reservation of Rights
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provision of these DSL-Capable Loops and the
associated rates, terms and conditions set forth above are subject to any legal or equitable rights
of review and remedies (including agency reconsideration and court review). If any
reconsideration, agency order, appeal, court order or opinion, stay, injunction or other action by
any state or federal regulatory body or court of competent jurisdiction stays, modifies, or otherwise
affects any of the rates, terms and conditions herein, specifically including those arising with respect
to Federal Communications Commission orders (whether from the Memorandum Opinion and
Order, and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 98-188 (rel. August 7, 1998), in CC Docket
No. 98-147, or the FCC's First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
FCC 99-48 (rel. March 31, 1999), in CC Docket 98-147 or the FCC's Third Report and Order
and Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket No. 96-96 (FCC 99-238), or
any other proceeding, the Parties shall expend diligent efforts to arrive at an agreement on
conforming modifications to this Agreement. If negotiations fail, disputes between the Parties
concerning the interpretation of the actions required or the provisions affected shall be handled
under the Dispute Resolution procedures set forth in this Agreement.

1.13 To the extent that there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of
Schedule 9.2.1 and this Schedule 9.5, the terms and conditions of
Schedule 9.2.1 shall prevail.
2.0 Conversion of Special Access Circuits.
Ameritech will convert Requesting Carrier’s Special Access Circuits to UNEs pursuant to FCC
Rule 315(b), under the conditions outlined below.
2.0.1 A special access circuit will qualify for conversion if it meets one
of the three following criteria:
2.0.1.1Requesting Carrier is the exclusive provider of the end
user’s local exchange service and the loop transport
combination originates at a customer’s premises and
terminates at Requesting Carrier’s collocation
arrangement. This option does not allow loop/transport
combinations to be connected to Ameritech services.
2.0.1.2Requesting Carrier provides local exchange and exchange
access service to the end user customer and handles at
least one-third of the end user’s local traffic measured as
a percent of total end user customer lines; and for DS1
level and above, at least 50 percent of the activated
channels on the loop portion of the loop and transport
combination have at least 5 percent local voice traffic individually, and the entire facility has at least 10 percent of the lo
loop/transport combination includes multiplexing (e.g.,
DS1 multiplexed to DS3 level), each of the individual
DS1 facilities must meet the criteria for this option in order
Sch. 9.5 - 4
Page 170 of 354

for the DS1/DS3 loop/transport combination to qualify for
UNE treatment. This option does not allow
loop/transport combination to be connected to Ameritech
services.
2.0.1.3At least 50 percent of the activated channels are used to
provide originating and terminating local dial tone service
and at least 50 percent of the traffic on each of these local
dial tone channels is local voice traffic (measured based
on Ameritech’s local exchange area) and the entire loop
facility has at least 33 precent local voice traffic. If a
loop/transport combination includes multiplexing, each of
the multiplexed channels must meet the above criteria for
this option. For example, if DS1 loops are multiplexed
onto DS3 transport, each of the individual DS1 circuits
must meet the above criteria for this option in order for
the DS1/DS3 loop/transport combination to qualify for
UNE treatment. This option does not allow
loop/transport combinations to be connected to
Ameritech services.
2.0.1.4For the purpose of this section, Ameritech collocation
arrangements in Payphone Services, Inc offices located at
3540 North Southport Avenue, Chicago, IL 60657 shall
be considered “Requesting Carrier collocation
arrangements.”
2.0.2 Requesting Carrier must certify that the special access circuits for
which it has submitted the orders to convert meet the criteria set forth in Section 2.1.1
above.
2.0.3 Requesting Carrier must pay any applicable termination charges
for the special access circuits that may be terminated early in order to convert to UNEs.
2.0.4 Requesting Carrier must pay any applicable service order and
administrative charges associated with the conversion of special access circuits to UNEs,
as identified in the Pricing Schedule.
2.0.5 Ameritech will not take Requesting Carrier's end user customer
out of service during conversion.

signed by both parties and filed with the FCC on February 29, 2000 in CC Docket No.
96-98, Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996.
2.0.7 Pursuant to the Arbitration Decision, for the purposes of certifying
its compliance with the criteria articulated in Section 2.3.1, above, Requesting Carrier may consider
ISP-bound traffic as local in nature.5/
3.0 Interoffice Transmission Facilities.
3.1 Requesting Carrier shall access Ameritech’s Interoffice Transmission Facilities via
Collocation or any technically feasible method pursuant to Section 2.2 of Schedule 9.5 at the
Ameritech Central Office where that element exists and each DSX or OCN circuit will be delivered
to Requesting Carrier’s Collocation space for an additional charge by means of a Cross-
Connection. Requesting Carrier shall order Interoffice Transmission Facilities from Ameritech by
delivering to Ameritech a valid and complete service order via an electronic Access Services
Request (“ASR”) interface. If after the Effective Date Ameritech makes available the ability to
order Interoffice Transmission Facilities via the Provisioning EI. Requesting Carrier agrees to
transition its ordering of such facilities from ASR to the Provisioning EI within thirty (30) days after
Ameritech is capable of receiving such orders via Provisioning EI.
3.2 Ameritech shall offer Interoffice Transmission Facilities in each of the following
ways:

Carrier and Ameritech or if the Maintenance EI is subject to temporary interruption, then
Requesting Carrier will transmit repair calls to Ameritech repair bureau by telephone and agrees
to reimburse Ameritech for Ameritech’s costs to process such repair calls.
6. Ameritech repair bureau, including the Maintenance EI to be established, shall be
on-line and operational twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week except when
Sch. 10.13 - 1
Page 178 of 354

preventative maintenance and software revisions require an out-of-service condition. Ameritech
will provide Requesting Carrier a twenty-four (24) hour advanced notification of such out-of-
service conditions.
7. Ameritech shall provide progress reports and status-of-repair efforts to Requesting
Carrier via the Maintenance EI. Ameritech shall inform Requesting Carrier of restoration of Resale
Service after an outage has occurred.
8. Maintenance charges for premises visits by Ameritech technicians shall be billed
by Requesting Carrier to its Customer, and not by Ameritech. The Ameritech technician shall,
however, present the Customer with unbranded form detailing the time spent, the materials used,
and an indication that the trouble has either been resolved or that additional work will be necessary,
in which case the Ameritech technician shall make an additional appointment with the Customer.
The Ameritech technician shall obtain the Customer’s signature when available upon said form, and
shall use the form to input maintenance charges into Ameritech’s repair and maintenance database.
9. Dispatching of Ameritech technicians to Requesting Carrier Customer premises
shall be accomplished by Ameritech pursuant to a request received from Requesting Carrier. The
gateway provided by Ameritech for the Maintenance EI shall allow Requesting Carrier to receive
trouble reports, analyze and sectionalize the trouble, determine whether it is necessary to dispatch
a service technician to the Customer’s premises, and verify any actual work completed on the
Customer’s premises.
10. Upon receiving a referred trouble from Requesting Carrier, the Ameritech
technician will offer a dispatch appointment and quoted repair time dependent upon Ameritech’s
force-to-load condition. For expedites, Ameritech’s maintenance administrators will override this
standard procedure on a non-discriminatory basis, using the same criteria as Ameritech uses to
expedite intervals for its retail Customers. If Ameritech is unable to meet a Requesting Carrier
expedited request, Ameritech will notify Requesting Carrier. If Requesting Carrier’s request for
an expedite requires Ameritech to perform work in addition to that when it expedites an order for
its retail Customers, Requesting Carrier shall compensate Ameritech to perform such work at rates
determined in accordance with Section 252(d) of the Act.
11. The Implementation Plan will establish a process for disaster recovery that
addresses the following:
(a) Events affecting Ameritech’s network, work centers and Operational Support
Systems functions;
(b) Establishing and maintaining a single point of contact responsible for disaster
recovery activation, statusing and problem resolution during the course of a disaster and restoration;
Sch. 10.13 - 2
Page 179 of 354

(c) Procedures for notifying Requesting Carrier of problems, initiating restoration plans
and advising Requesting Carrier of the status of resolution;
(d) Definition of a disaster; and
(e) Equal priority, as between Requesting Carrier Customers and Ameritech
Customers, for restoration efforts, consistent with FCC Service Restoration guidelines, including,
deployment of repair personnel, and access to spare parts and components.
12. If (i) Requesting Carrier reports to Ameritech a trouble report with respect to a
Resale Service, Requesting Carrier, (ii) Ameritech dispatches a technician, and (iii) such trouble
was not caused by Ameritech’s facilities or equipment, then Requesting Carrier shall pay Ameritech
a trip charge per trouble dispatch and time charges per quarter hour, in each case at the then
current rates applicable in the Territory.

SCHEDULE 12.9.1
PHYSICAL COLLOCATION SPACE RESERVATION
Space for Physical Collocation may be reserved on the following basis:
1. Requesting Carrier may request to reserve additional space (or bays) in an
Ameritech Central Office in which the Requesting Carrier has Physical Collocation for permitted
telecommunications-related equipment.
2. A reservation may be maintained only by the payment of a non-recurring charge
to defray the administrative costs of the reservation system (“Reservation Charge”).
3. The reservation can be made for an amount of space no greater than the amount
of active Physical Collocation space being occupied and utilized (e.g., if Requesting Carrier is
utilizing only one (1) bay in a one hundred (100) square foot space, only one (1) bay may be
reserved) for Interconnection with and/or access to the Network Elements of Ameritech by
Requesting Carrier in the particular Central Office.
4. The reservation takes a priority based on the date at which it is made.
5. If Ameritech receives an order for Physical Collocation in an office in which all the
unoccupied space is covered by reservations, all reservations will be prioritized. The holder(s) of
the lowest priority reservation(s) that when considering all higher priority reservations, still
represent(s) available space sufficient to partially or completely fill the order(s) for Physical
Collocation (each, an “Option Party”) will be given written notice of its (their) option of
“enforcing” or relinquishing its (their) reservation(s).
In this case, an Option Party may enforce its reservation by payment of the
recurring Physical Collocation floor space charge otherwise applicable to the reservation space (in
lieu of the non-recurring Reservation Charge). The reservation will be maintained until the Physical
Collocation arrangement in that office is terminated or the reservation is terminated, whichever
comes first. If an Option Party decides to enforce its reservation in this manner, the holder(s) of
the reservation(s) with the next higher priority will be given the option of enforcing or relinquishing
its (their) reservation(s).
If an Option Party declines to enforce its reservation as indicated above, the reservation
is relinquished and the reservation payment is forfeited. A new reservation may be activated by
payment of another Reservation Charge, but the new reservation will be given a priority based on
the date Ameritech received the reactivation reservation. The holder(s) of the reservation(s) with
Sch. 12.9.1 - 1
Page 186 of 354

the next higher priority will be required to enforce or relinquish its (their) reservation(s) until such
time as all Option Parties have either enforced or relinquished its (their) space reservation(s).
6. The holder of a valid reservation may place an order for Physical Collocation for
the reserved space at any time. If there is sufficient unoccupied space to accommodate the order
after subtracting space covered by reservations of higher priority, the order will be processed. If
there is insufficient space to accommodate the order after subtracting space covered by valid
reservations of Option Parties with higher priority that have been enforced, the holder’s reservation
shall be maintained.
7. In a Central Office, Ameritech may reserve space on the following conditions:
· The amount of space must be the least amount of space reasonably necessary for
the provision of a communications-related service including Interconnection and the
provision of unbundled Network Elements. Except for space reserved for switch
(including Tandem Switches and STPs) conversion and growth and for
augmentation and conversion of mechanical and electrical support systems and
building infrastructure, the reserved space must reasonably be anticipated to be
used in three (3) years.
· The total amount of space reserved cannot exceed the amount of space Ameritech
is currently using in the Central Office.
8. Ameritech shall enforce its reservation in the same manner in which Requesting
Carrier and other collocating Telecommunications Carriers shall be required to enforce their
reservations. In that case, Ameritech may impute the floor space charge to the operations for which
the space is reserved.
9. Requesting Carrier may not assign a reservation to any third party, including its
Affiliate or a prospective Resident Collocator.
Sch. 12.9.1 - 2

AMENDMENT TO
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY d/b/a SBC ILLINOIS
AND
GLOBALCOM, INC.
This Resale Contract Assumption Amendment (the “Amendment”) is to the Interconnection Agreement under
Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by and between Illinois Bell Telephone Company d/b/a
SBC Illinois1 (“SBC Illinois”) and Globalcom, Inc. (“CLEC”).
WHEREAS, SBC Illinois and CLEC are parties to a certain Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and
252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”), as may have been amended prior to the date hereof (the
“Agreement”);
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 252(a)(1) of the Act and the terms of their Agreement, the Parties wish to
amend the Agreement to ensure that the obligations related to unbundled network elements remain consistent with
applicable law; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree
to amend the Agreement as follows:
1. This section applies only to SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE:
1.1 CLEC may convert current SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE End User(s) that have existing term,
volume, termination liability or any customer specific pricing contracts (collectively referred to hereinafter
as “CSP Contracts”) for services offered within the state of Kansas or Texas, and
1.2 SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE and any other reseller of SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE
local service may convert current CLEC End User(s) that have existing CSP Contracts for services
offered within the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma or Missouri.
1.3 In the event of a conversion under either Section 1.1 or 1.2, CLEC and SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE shall comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 1.4 and 1.5.

1.4.1 CLEC shall sign an “Assumption of Existing Agreement” assuming the balance of the terms,
including volume, term and termination liability remaining on any current retail SBC SOUTHWEST
REGION 5-STATE or resold End User CSP Contract at the time of conversion. CLEC may
assume the CSP Contract at the wholesale discount of 5.0% in Arkansas and Kansas and 5.62%
in Texas. CLECs may assume tariffed volume and term contracts at the wholesale discount of
8.0% in the states of Arkansas and Kansas and 8.04% in the state of Texas.

1.4.4 If another reseller of SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE local service converts current CLEC
End User(s) that has an existing CSP Contract, it is CLEC's responsibility to address assumption of
the CSP contact and termination liability with the other reseller. CLEC agrees that SBC
SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE has no responsibilities in such a situation, and CLEC further
agrees that it will not make any Claim against SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE in
connection with any conversion by another reseller of SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE local
service of any CLEC End User(s) that has an existing CSP contract.
1.5 Responsibilities of SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-STATE in connection with Assumptions of CSP

volume, term and termination liability remaining on a current CSP contract between CLEC and its
End User at the time that CLEC’s End User is converted to SBC SOUTHWEST REGION 5-
STATE.
2. This section applies only to SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE:

basis awaiting the outcome of the pending cost study.
2.2.5 SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE Non-Standard Service contracts may be assumed, but receive
no wholesale discount.
2.3 If CLEC elects to terminate a SBC MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE retail contract which CLEC had
previously assumed, CLEC will be assessed the applicable termination charges remaining unless CLEC
elects to simultaneously replace the existing contract with a contract of greater term and/or volume at the
same discount CLEC receives for the previously assumed but now terminated contract.

rights, remedies or arguments with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands

ICC JUNE 9, 2004 ORDER AMENDMENT
TO THE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT UNDER
SECTIONS 251 AND 252 OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996
This ICC June 9, 2004 Order Amendment to the Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and 252 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Amendment”) is being entered into by and between Illinois Bell Telephone
Company d/b/a SBC Illinois (“SBC Illinois”)1 and Globalcom, Inc. (“CLEC”).
WHEREAS, SBC Illinois and CLEC are parties to an interconnection agreement that was previously submitted to
the Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) for approval, and may have been amended prior to this Amendment (the
“Agreement”);
WHEREAS, the ICC issued an order (“Order”) in Docket No. 02-0864, on June 9, 2004, approving certain
Illinois-specific prices and other requirements pertaining to unbundled network elements (“UNEs”) that are included in
the Agreement;
WHEREAS, provisions of the Agreement require the incorporation into the Agreement of new prices such as
those established by the Order; and
WHEREAS, based on the foregoing and except as may be otherwise expressly noted, the Parties are entering
into this Amendment to incorporate pricing changes into the Agreement, subject to the reservation of rights and other
provisions hereof.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
Agreement.
1.2 To the extent there is a conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Amendment and the
provisions of the Agreement (including all incorporated or accompanying Appendices, Addenda and Exhibits
to the Agreement), the provisions of this Amendment shall control and apply but only to the extent of such
conflict or inconsistency.
2. AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT
2.1 On and after the Amendment Effective Date (as defined in Section 3 of this Amendment), the Agreement is
hereby amended by referencing and incorporating the following:
2.1.1 Solely to conform the Agreement to effectuate certain pricing changes established by the
Commission, the Agreement is amended to add the attached pricing schedule labeled Attachment A
(which is incorporated herein).
2.1.2 Subject to Section 2.3, and except to the extent otherwise specified in Attachment A, the new rates
and rate structures shall begin to apply on June 25, 2004.
2.2 This Amendment is provided as a means by which the Parties, which have an interconnection agreement
under Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, can obtain the rights and obligations
under ICC orders. Nothing in this Amendment expands, contracts, or otherwise affects either Party’s rights
or obligations under the Agreement beyond the express provisions of this Amendment.
2.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including anything in the Agreement or this Amendment (including
Section 2.1.2 hereof), in no event shall this Amendment result in the retroactive application of any rate or
rate structure contained in Attachment A back to any date earlier than June 25, 2004. This limitation to the
1Illinois Bell Telephone Company (previously referred to as "Illinois Bell") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameritech Corporation that offers
telecommunications services, and now operates under the name "SBC Illinois" pursuant to an assumed name filing with the State of Illinois.

retroactive application of rates contained in this Amendment is not intended and shall not be construed in
any way to limit either Party to rate application “true-up” provisions contained in the Agreement, any
amendment to that Agreement, including that certain Amendment that contains Schedule 9.2.8, or any FCC
or ICC Orders including the Final Order in ICC Docket No. 01-0662, as such limitation is strictly limited to
those rates specified in Attachment A.
2.4 To the extent the underlying Agreement does not contain terms and conditions for UNE(s) listed in
Attachment A to this Amendment, this Amendment does not provide CLEC with the ability to obtain and/or
order such UNEs. Rather, CLEC must negotiate a separate amendment incorporating the appropriate terms
and conditions into the underlying Agreement before ordering and/or obtaining any such UNE(s) under this
Agreement.
3. AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE DATE
3.1 The effective date of this Amendment shall be immediate upon approval of this Amendment by the ICC
under Section 252(e) of the Act or, absent such ICC approval, the date this Amendment is filed under
Section 252(e)(4) of the Act (“Amendment Effective Date”); provided, however, that the rates contained
herein shall be applied in accordance with Sections 2.1.2 and 2.3 of this Amendment. In the event that all or
any portion of this Amendment as agreed-to and submitted is rejected and/or modified by the ICC, this
Amendment shall be automatically suspended and, unless otherwise mutually agreed, the Parties shall
expend diligent efforts to arrive at mutually acceptable new provisions to replace those rejected and/or
modified by the ICC; provided, however, that failure to reach such mutually acceptable new provisions within
ten (10) days after such suspension shall permit either party to terminate this Amendment upon five (5)
days’ written notice to the other.
4. TERM OF AMENDMENT
4.1 EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING
AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED. Nothing contained herein modifies or amends Article 28 of
the Agreement. This Amendment will become effective as of the Amendment Effective Date, and will
terminate on the termination or expiration of the Agreement; provided, however, this Amendment, in whole
or in part, may terminate or expire earlier pursuant to other provisions of this Amendment, including Section
6, as provided in Article 28 of the Agreement. This Amendment does not extend the term of the Agreement.
5. APPLICATION OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS
5.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Amendment is the result of ICC rate orders and solely
addresses pricing. Accordingly, the Parties further acknowledge and agree that no aspect of this
Amendment qualifies for portability into any other state under any state or federal statute, regulation, order
or legal obligation (collectively "Law"), if any. The Parties also acknowledge that the entirety of this
Amendment and its provisions are non-severable, and are “legitimately related” as that phrase is understood
under Section 252(i) of Title 47, United States Code.
6. RESERVATIONS OF RIGHTS

ILLINOIS TRO/TRRO ATTACHMENT
0.1 Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to this Attachment.
0.1.1 Building. For purposes of this Attachment relative to the DS1 and DS3 loop caps as defined in Rules
51.319(a)(4)(ii) and 51.319(a)(5)(ii), a “building” or a “single building” is a structure under one roof. Two
or more physical structures that share a connecting wall or are in close physical proximity shall not be
considered a single building solely because of a connecting tunnel or covered walkway, or a shared
parking garage or parking area, unless such structures share the same street address (e.g., two
department stores connected by a covered walkway to protect shoppers from weather would be
considered two separate buildings). An educational, industrial, governmental or medical premises or
campus shall constitute a single building for purposes of the DS1 and DS3 loop and transport caps
provided that all of the structures are located on the same continuous property and the DS1 and/or DS3
loops are terminated at a single structure and are subsequently routed throughout the premises or
campus, the property is owned and/or leased by the same end-user customer, and the property is not
separated by a public roadway.
0.1.2 Fiber-to-the-Curb (FTTC) Loop. A Fiber-to-the-Curb Loop is defined as a (1) local Loop serving Mass
Market Customers consisting of fiber optic cable connecting to a copper distribution plant that is not more
than 500 feet from the customer’s premises or (2) a local Loop serving customers in a Predominantly
Residential MDU consisting of fiber optic cable connecting to a copper distribution plant that is not more
than 500 feet from the MDU’s MPOE. For purposes of the definition of FTTC and FTTH Loops, examples
of a “Predominantly Residential” MDU include an apartment building, condominium building, cooperative
or planned unit development that allocates more than fifty percent of its rentable square footage to
residences. Notwithstanding the above, a loop will only be deemed a FTTC Loop if it connects to a
copper distribution plant at a serving area interface from which every other copper distribution Subloop
also is not more than 500 feet from the respective customer’s premises.
0.1.3 Fiber-to-the-Home Loop. A Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) Loop is defined as a local Loop serving a
Customer and consisting entirely of fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit, serving a Mass Market
Customer premises or, in the case of Predominantly Residential MDUs, a fiber optic cable, whether dark
or lit, that extends to the multiunit premises’ minimum point of entry (MPOE).
0.1.4 Hybrid Loop is a local Loop that serves a Mass Market Customer and is composed of both fiber optic
cable and copper wire or cable between the main distribution frame (or its equivalent) in an SBC wire
center and the demarcation point at the customer premises.
0.1.5 Mass Market Customer is an end user customer who is either (a) a residential customer or (b) a very
small business customer at a premises served by telecommunications facilities with an aggregate
transmission capacity of less than four DS-0s.
0.1.6 Intentionally left blank.
0.1.7 Non-Impaired Wire Centers for DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity Loops. In accordance with Rule
51.319(a)(4), Unbundled DS1 Loop Non-Impaired Wire Centers are defined as wire centers serving at
least 60,000 business lines and at least four fiber-based collocators. In accordance with Rule
51.319(a)(5), DS3 Loop Non-Impaired Wire Centers are defined as wire centers serving at least 38,000
business lines and at least four fiber-based collocators.
0.1.8 Tier 1 Non-Impaired Wire Centers for DS1, DS3 and Dark Fiber Unbundled Dedicated Transport. Tier 1
Non-Impaired Wire Centers are defined in accordance with Rule 51.319(e)(3)(i) as wire centers serving
at least four fiber-based collocators, at least 38,000 business lines, or both.
0.1.9 Tier 2 Non-Impaired Wire Centers for DS1, DS3 and Dark Fiber Unbundled Dedicated Transport. Tier 2
non-impaired Wire Centers are defined in accordance with Rule 51.319(e)(3)(ii) as wire centers that are
not Tier 1 Wire Centers, but contain at least three fiber-based collocators, at least 24,000 business lines,
or both.

0.1.10 Tier 3 Wire Centers. In accordance with Rule 51.319(e)(3)(iii), Tier 3 Wire Centers are defined as wire
centers that do not meet the criteria for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Wire Centers.
0.1.11 Business Lines. For purposes of determining Tier 1 and Tier 2 Wire Centers, Business Line tallies shall
be calculated in accordance with the FCC’s TRRO, including Rule 51.5 as follows: A Business Line is an
ILEC-owned switched access line used to serve a business customer, whether by the ILEC itself or by a
CLEC that leases the line from the ILEC. The number of business lines in a wire center shall equal the
sum of all ILEC business switched access lines, plus the sum of all UNE loops connected to that wire
center, including UNE loops provisioned in combination with other unbundled elements. Among these
requirements, business line tallies (1) shall include only those access lies connecting end-user customers
with ILEC end-offices for switched services, (2) shall not include non-switched special access lines, (3)
shall account for ISDN and other digital access lines by counting each 64 kbps-equivalent as one line.
For example, a DS1 line corresponds to 24 64 kbps-equivalents, and therefore to 24 “Business Lines.”
Centrex and PBX Trunks and Centrex Extensions will be counted as outlined in the ARMIS 43-08
reporting guidelines.
0.1.12 Embedded Base. Embedded Base used as a term in this Attachment is defined for TRO Affected
Elements identified in Section 1.0 as those TRO Affected Elements for which CLEC had generated and
SBC had accepted a valid service order requesting the provisioning of such TRO Affected Element(s) for
a customer as of the date of this Attachment. For the TRO Remand Affected Elements identified in
Sections 2.0 and 3.0, the Embedded Base is defined as including those customers for which CLEC had
generated and SBC had accepted a valid service order requesting the provisioning of TRO Remand
Affected Element(s) prior to March 11, 2005.
0.1.13 DS1 Loop. A “DS1 Loop”, in accordance with Rule 51.319(a)(4), is defined as a digital local loop having
a total digital signal speed of 1.544 MBps per second. A DS1 Loop includes the electronics necessary to
provide the DS1 transmission rate digital UNE Local Loop having a total digital signal speed of 1.544
megabytes per second. A DS1 Loop also includes all electronics, optronics and intermediate devices
used to establish the transmission path to the end user customer premises as well as any inside wire
owned or controlled by SBC that is part of that transmission path. DS1 Loops include, but are not limited
to, two-wire and four-wire copper loops capable of providing high-bit rate DSL services, including T1
services.
0.1.14 Fiber-Based Collocator. A fiber-based collocator is any carrier, unaffiliated with the ILEC, that maintains
a collocation arrangement in an ILEC wire center, with active electrical power supply, and operates a
fiber-optic cable or comparable transmission facility that (1) terminates at a collocation arrangement
within the wire center; (2) leaves the ILEC wire center premises; and (3) is owned by a party other than
the ILEC or any affiliate of the ILEC, except as set forth in this paragraph. Dark fiber obtained from an
ILEC on an indefeasible right of use basis shall be treated as non-ILEC fiber-optic cable. Two or more
affiliated fiber-based collocators in a single wire center shall collectively be counted as a single fiber-
based collocator. For purposes of this definition the term “affiliate” is defined by 47 U.S.C. §153(1).
0.1.15 DS3 Loop. DS3 Loops are digital transmission channels suitable for the transport of isochronous bipolar
serial data at a rate of 44.736 Mbps (the equivalent of 28 DS1 channels). A DS3 Loop includes the
electronics necessary to provide the DS3 transmission rate having a total digital signal speed of 44.736
megabytes per second. A DS3 Loop also includes all of the electronics, optronics and intermediate
devices used to establish the transmission path to the end user customer premises as well as any inside
wire owned or controlled by SBC that is part of that transmission path.
0.1.16 Dedicated Transport. Dedicated Transport in accordance with Rule 51.319(e) and (e)(1) includes SBC
transmission facilities between wire centers or switches owned by SBC, or between wire centers or
switches owned by SBC and switches owned by other telecommunications carriers, including, but not
limited to, DS1-, DS3- and OCn-capacity level services, as well as dark fiber, dedicated to a particular
customer or carrier.

network elements under Section 251 in accordance with the FCC’s TRO, the MDU Reconsideration Order
(FCC 04-191) (rel. Aug. 9, 2004) and the TRO Reconsideration Orders as follows:
(i) Intentionally left blank
(ii) OCn level dedicated transport1;
(iii) DS1 and above Local Circuit Switching (defined as Local Switching for the purpose of serving end
user customers using DS1 capacity and above Loops). To avoid any doubt, pursuant to this
Attachment, SBC is no longer required to provide any ULS/UNE-P pursuant to Section 251(c)(3)
except as otherwise provided for in this Attachment, e.g., the Embedded Base during the transition
periods as set forth in Sections 1.0 and 2.0;
(iv) OCn loops;
(v) the feeder portion of the loop as a stand alone UNE under Section 251;
(vi) packet switching, including routers and DSLAMs;

SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
Accordingly, upon the Amendment Effective Date, CLEC will cease new orders for TRO Affected
Element(s) under Section 251.
1.3 In addition to those Transition Periods set forth in other sections of this Attachment, and without limiting
the same, SBC and CLEC will abide by the following transitional procedures with respect to the TRO
Affected Elements:
1.3.1 With respect to TRO Affected Elements and/or the combination of TRO Affected Elements as
defined in Section 1.1 of this Attachment, SBC will notify CLEC in writing as to any TRO Affected
Element previously made available to CLEC that is or has become a TRO Affected Element, as
defined in Section 1.1 of this Attachment herein (“Identified TRO Facility”). For purposes of the
Agreement and this Attachment, such Identified TRO Facilities shall be considered TRO Affected
Elements.
1.3.2 For any Identified TRO Facility SBC shall continue to provide the Embedded Base of any such
TRO Affected Element without change to CLEC on a transitional basis. At any time after CLEC
receives notice from SBC pursuant to Section 1.3.1 above, but no later than the end of 90 days
from the date CLEC received notice, CLEC shall, using the applicable service ordering process
and interface, either (i) request disconnection; (ii) submit a request for analogous access service;
or (iii) identify and request another alternative service arrangement.
1.3.3 CLEC agrees to pay all non-recurring charges applicable to the transition of its Embedded Base
provided the order activities necessary to facilitate such transition involve physical work (i.e., does
not include the re-use of Identified TRO Facilities in the same configuration) and involve other than
a “record order” transaction. The rates, terms and conditions associated with such transactions are
set forth in the Pricing Schedule and/or Tariff applicable to the service being transitioned to. To the
extent that physical work is not involved in the transition, the applicable service order charge will be
the only applicable charge under the applicable Pricing Schedule and/or Tariff. SBC will complete
CLEC transition orders in accordance with the OSS guidelines in place in support of the analogous
service that the CLEC is requesting the Identified TRO Facility be transitioned to with any
disruption to the end user’s service reduced to a minimum or, where technically feasible given
current systems and processes, no disruption should occur. Where disruption is unavoidable due
to technical considerations, SBC shall accomplish such conversions in a manner to minimize a
disruption detectable to the end user. Where necessary or appropriate, SBC and CLEC shall
coordinate such conversions.
1.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to the Agreement,
at the end of the ninety day transitional period, unless CLEC has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance
LSR or ASR, as applicable, under subparagraph 1.3.2(i), above, and if CLEC and SBC have failed to
reach agreement, under subparagraph 1.3.2(ii) or (iii), above, as to a substitute service arrangement or
element, then SBC will convert the subject element(s), whether alone or in combination with or as part of
any other arrangement, to an analogous resale or access service or arrangement, if available, at rates
applicable to such analogous service or arrangement.
1.5 The Parties’ rights and obligations with respect to TRO Affected Elements under this Section 1.0 are also
subject to Sections 13.0 and 14.0 of this Attachment.
2.0 TRO Remand Affected Unbundled Local Circuit Switching and UNE-P Elements. To avoid any doubt,
pursuant to this Attachment, SBC is no longer required to provide any ULS/UNE-P pursuant to Section 251(c)(3)
except as otherwise provided for in this Attachment, e.g., the Embedded Base during the transition periods as
set forth in Sections 1.0 and 2.0.
2.1 In accordance with Rule 51.319(d)(2), SBC shall not be required to provide Unbundled Local Circuit
Switching and UNE-P (ULS/UNE-P) Elements under Section 251(c)(3) where the ULS/UNE-P is
requested or provisioned for the purpose of serving DS-0 capacity loops, in accordance with the following
provisions:

2.1.1 SBC is not required to provide new ULS, either alone or in combination (as in with “UNE-P”) as an
unbundled network element under Section 251 of the Act for non-Embedded Base customers.
SBC shall continue to provide access to ULS and UNE-P to CLEC for CLEC to serve its
Embedded Base of customers in accordance with Rule 51.319(d)(2)(iii) and orders issued by the
ICC. The price for such ULS and UNE-P shall be SBC's tariffed and effective ULS and UNE-P
rates as of June 25, 2004, plus one dollar. CLEC shall be fully liable to SBC to pay such pricing
under the Agreement effective as of March 11, 2005, including applicable terms and conditions
setting forth penalties for failure to comply with payment terms, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Agreement, provided that bills rendered prior to the effective date of this Attachment
that include such rate increases shall not be subject to late payments charges, as to such
increases, if CLEC pays such increased amount within thirty (30) days after the effective date of
this Attachment.
2.1.1.1 CLEC shall be entitled to initiate feature add and/or change orders, record orders, and
disconnect orders for Embedded Base customers. CLEC shall also be entitled to initiate
orders for the conversion of UNE-P to a UNE line splitting arrangement to serve the same
end user and UNE line splitting arrangement to UNE-P for the same end-user. CLEC shall
be entitled to initiate move orders and orders for additional UNE-P lines for Embedded
Base customers.
2.1.1.2 Feature adds and/or change orders as referenced in Section 2.1.1.1 include features that
SBC has available and activated in the Local Circuit Switch.
2.1.1.3 In accordance with Rule 51.319(d)(4)(i), SBC shall provide a CLEC with nondiscriminatory
access to signaling, call-related databases and shared transport facilities on an unbundled
basis, in accordance with section 251 (c)(3) of the Act and in accordance with and only to
the extent permitted by the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.
2.1.2 SBC shall continue to provide access to ULS/UNE-P for CLEC to serve its Embedded Base of
customers under this Section 2.1.2, in accordance with and only to the extent permitted by the
terms and conditions set forth in this Attachment, for a transitional period of time, ending upon the
earlier of:
(a) CLEC’s disconnection or other discontinuance (except Suspend/Restore) of use of one or
more of the ULS or UNE-P;
(b) CLEC’s transition of a ULS Element(s) or UNE-P to an alternative arrangement; or
(c) March 11, 2006.
2.1.3 In accordance with Rule 51.319(d)(2)(ii), CLECs shall migrate the Embedded Base of end-user
customers off of the ULS element to an alternative arrangement within 12 months of the effective
date of the TRO Remand, i.e., March 11, 2006. CLEC and SBC agree to utilize the twelve-month
transition period as set forth by the FCC in Paragraph 227 of the TRO Remand to perform the
tasks necessary to complete an orderly transition including the CLECs submission of the
necessary orders to convert their Embedded Base of ULS/UNE-P customers to an alternative
service.
2.1.3.1 To the extent CLEC intends to convert its Embedded Base of ULS/UNE-P arrangements to
an alternative SBC service arrangement, CLEC shall generate the orders necessary to
convert its Embedded Base of ULS/UNE-P arrangements to an alternative SBC service
arrangement in accordance with this ULS/UNE-P transition plan unless otherwise agreed
to by the Parties.
2.1.3.2 SBC will complete CLEC transition orders in support of the analogous service that the
CLEC is requesting the ULS/UNE-P be transitioned to with any disruption to the end user’s
service reduced to a minimum or, where technically feasible given current systems and
processes, no disruption should occur. Where disruption is unavoidable due to technical
considerations, SBC shall accomplish such conversions in a manner to minimize any

disruption detectable to the end user. Where necessary or appropriate, SBC and CLEC
shall coordinate such conversions.
2.1.3.3 CLEC agrees to pay all non-recurring charges applicable to the transition of its Embedded
Base provided the order activities necessary to facilitate such transition involve physical
work (physical work does not include the re-use of facilities in the same configuration) and
involve other than a “record order” transaction. The rates, terms and conditions associated
with such transactions are set forth in the Pricing Schedule or Tariff applicable to the
service being transitioned to. To the extent that physical work is not involved in the
transition, the applicable service order charge(s) will be the only non-recurring charge(s)
that apply.
2.1.3.4 To the extent there are CLEC Embedded Base ULS/ UNE-P arrangements in place at the
conclusion of the twelve (12) month transition period, SBC, without further notice or liability,
will re-price such arrangements to market-based rates.
2.2 The provisions of this Section 2.0, apply and are operative with respect to SBC’s unbundling obligations
under Section 251 regardless of whether CLEC is requesting ULS/UNE-P under the Agreement or under
a state tariff, if applicable, and regardless of whether the state tariff is referenced in the Agreement.
2.3 The Parties’ rights and obligations with respect to TRO Remand Affected Elements under this Section 2.0
are also subject to Sections 13.0 and 14.0 of this Attachment.
3.0 TRO Remand Affected Unbundled High-Capacity Loops and Transport.

Section 251 Dark Fiber Unbundled Dedicated Transport will be required of SBC on such routes,
except as otherwise set forth in this Attachment.
3.2 Transition of TRO Remand Affected Unbundled High Capacity Loops and Transport. For those DS1 and
DS3 Loops and DS1 and DS3 Dedicated Transport facilities that SBC is no longer required to unbundle
under Section 251 under the terms of this Attachment as of March 11, 2005, SBC shall continue to
provide CLEC’s Embedded Base of such arrangements ordered by CLEC before March 11, 2005 for a
12-month period beginning on March 11, 2005 and ending on March 11, 2006. For those Dark Fiber
Loops, and Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport facilities that SBC is no longer required to unbundle under
Section 251 under the terms of this Attachment as of March 11, 2005, SBC shall continue to provide such
arrangements for an 18-month period beginning on March 11, 2005 and ending on September 11, 2006.
3.2.1 During the transition periods defined in Section 3.2, the rates for the High-Capacity Loop and

should occur. Where disruption is unavoidable due to technical considerations, SBC shall
accomplish such conversions in a manner to minimize any disruption detectable to the end
user. Where necessary or appropriate, SBC and CLEC shall coordinate such conversions.
3.2.2.2 CLEC agrees to pay all non-recurring charges applicable to the transition of its Embedded
Base provided the order activities necessary to facilitate such transition involve physical
work and involve other than a “record order” transaction. The rates, terms and conditions
associated with such transactions are set forth in the Pricing Schedule or Tariff applicable
to the service being transitioned to. To the extent that physical work is not involved in the
transition, the applicable service order charge(s) and/or non-recurring charges, if any as
governed by this Agreement and/or Tariff from which the service being transitioned to is
ordered, will be the only non-recurring charge(s) that apply.
3.2.2.3 If CLEC has not submitted an LSR or ASR, as applicable, to SBC requesting conversion of
the Affected DS1 and DS3 Loop/Transport Elements to another wholesale service, then on
March 11, 2006, SBC, at its option, shall convert such loop(s)/transport to an analogous
special access arrangement at month-to-month pricing. Nothing in this Section prohibits
the Parties from agreeing upon another service arrangement within the requisite transition
timeframe (e.g., via a separate agreement at market-based rates). If CLEC has not
submitted an LSR or ASR, as applicable, to SBC requesting that the Affected Dark Fiber
Loop and Transport arrangements be disconnected and returned to SBC, SBC shall
disconnect such arrangements that remain in place as of September 11, 2006.
3.3 The Parties’ rights and obligations with respect to TRO Remand Affected Elements under this Section 3.0
are also subject to Sections 13.0 and 14.0 of this Attachment.
4.0 Non-Impaired Wire Center Criteria and Related Processes.
4.1 SBC has designated and posted to CLEC Online a list of wire centers where it contends the thresholds for
DS1 and DS3 Unbundled High-Capacity Loops as stated in Section 0.1.7 and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Non-
Impaired Wire Centers as stated in Sections 0.1.8 and 0.1.9 have been met. SBC’s designations shall be
treated as controlling (even if CLEC believes the list is inaccurate) for purposes of transition and ordering
unless CLEC provides a self-certification as outlined below. Until CLEC provides a self-certification for
High-Capacity Loops and/or Transport for such wire center designations, CLEC will not submit High
Capacity Loop and/or Transport orders based on the wire center designation, and if no self-certification is
provided will transition its affected High-Capacity Loops and/or Transport in accordance with the
applicable transition period. If CLEC does not provide a self-certification, CLEC will transition DS1 and
DS3 Loop and Transport arrangements affected by SBC’s wire center designation as of March 11, 2005
by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or arrangement, if available, by March 11, 2006
and CLEC will transition any Dark Fiber Transport arrangements affected by SBC’s wire center
designations as of March 11, 2005 by disconnecting or transitioning to an alternate facility or
arrangement, if available, by September 11, 2006. SBC will update the CLEC Online posted list and will
advise CLECs of such posting via Accessible Letter, which term for the purposes of this Section 4.0 shall
be deemed to mean an Accessible Letter issued after the effective date of this Amendment, as set forth in
this Section 4.0.
If the ICC has not previously determined, in any proceeding, that a wire center is properly designated as a
wire center meeting the thresholds set forth in Sections 0.1.7, 0.1.8 or 0.1.9, then, prior to submitting an
order for an unbundled a DS1/DS3 Loop, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated
Transport arrangement at a wire center designated by SBC and posted to CLEC Online, CLEC shall
perform a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine, to the best of CLEC’s knowledge, whether the wire
center meets the non-impairment thresholds as set forth in Sections 0.1.7, 0.1.8 or 0.1.9 of this
Amendment. If, based on its reasonably diligent inquiry, the CLEC disputes the SBC wire center non-
impairment designation, the CLEC will provide a self-certification to SBC identifying the wire center(s) that
it is self-certifying for. In performing its inquiry, CLEC shall not be required to consider any lists of Non-
Impaired Wire Centers compiled by SBC as creating a presumption that a wire center is not impaired.

SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
CLEC may self-certify by sending written notification to SBC using letter, facsimile or e-mail. In the event
that the CLEC issues a self-certification to SBC where SBC has deemed that the non-impairment
threshold has been met in a specific wire center for High-Capacity Loops and/or Transport, CLEC can
continue to submit and SBC must continue to accept and provision orders for the affected High Capacity
Loops and/or Transport provided the CLEC is entitled to order such pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the underlying Agreement, for as long as such self-certification remains in effect and valid pursuant to
the dispute resolution provisions of Section 4.0. If CLEC makes such a self-certification, and CLEC is
otherwise entitled to the ordered element under the Agreement, SBC shall provision the requested
facilities in accordance with CLEC’s order and within SBC’s standard ordering interval applicable to such
facilities. If SBC in error rejects CLEC orders, where CLEC has provided self certification in accordance
with this Section 4.0, SBC will modify its systems to accept such orders within 5 business hours of CLEC
notification to its account manager.
4.1.1 The parties recognize that wire centers that SBC had not designated as meeting the FCC’s non-
impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005 may meet those thresholds in the future. In the event
that a wire center that was not designated by SBC as meeting one or more of the FCC’s non-
impairment thresholds as of March 11, 2005 meets one or more of these thresholds at a later date,
SBC may add the wire center to the list of designated wire centers and the Parties will use the
following process:
4.1.1.1 SBC may update the wire center list as changes occur.
4.1.1.2 To designate a wire center that had previously not met one or more of the FCC’s
impairment thresholds but subsequently does so, SBC will provide notification to CLEC via
Accessible Letter and by a posting on CLEC Online.
4.1.1.3 SBC will continue to accept CLEC orders for newly-designated DS1/DS3 Loops, DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport without requiring CLEC self-
certification for 30 calendar days after the date the Accessible Letter is issued.
4.1.1.4 In the event the CLEC disagrees with SBC’s determination, and desires not to have the
applicable established DS1/DS3 Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport and/or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport transitioned or disconnected as set forth in Section 4.1.1.5 below,
CLEC has 60 calendar days from the issuance of the Accessible Letter to provide a self-
certification to SBC.
4.1.1.5 If the CLEC does not use the self-certification process described in Section 4.0 to self-
certify against SBC’s wire center designation within 60 calendar days of the issuance of the
Accessible Letter, the parties must comply with the Applicable Transitional Period as
follows: transition applicable to DS1/DS3 Loops is within 12 months, transition applicable to
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport is within 12 months, and disconnection applicable to Dark
Fiber Dedicated Transport is within 18 months. All such transitional periods apply from the
date of the issuance of the Accessible Letter providing the wire center designation of non-
impairment. For the Applicable Transitional Period, no additional notification will be
required. DS1 Loops will continue to be provisioned for a period of 12 months from the
date of the Accessible Letter for existing customers. SBC shall continue to provide access
to DS1 Loops to CLEC for applicable established customer service in accordance with and
only to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions set forth in this Attachment, ending
upon the earlier of:
(a) CLEC’s disconnection or other discontinuance of use of DS1/DS3 Loops;
(b) CLEC’s transition of DS1/DS3 Loops to an alternative arrangement; or
(c) the applicable transition period.
SBC will not convert or disconnect DS1/DS3 High Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated
Transport, or Dark Fiber Transport prior to the end of the applicable transitional period

unless specifically requested by CLEC; CLEC is responsible for submitting orders to
complete the transition by the end of applicable transition period.
4.1.1.6 If the CLEC does provide self-certification, SBC may dispute CLEC’s self-certification as
described in Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 and SBC will accept and provision the applicable
loop and transport orders for the CLEC providing the self-certification during a dispute
resolution process.
4.1.1.7 During the applicable transition period, the rates paid will be the rates in effect at the time
of the non-impairment designations plus 15%.
4.1.2 If the ICC has previously determined, in any proceeding, even if CLEC was not a party to that
proceeding that a wire center is properly designated as a wire center meeting the thresholds set
forth in Sections 0.1.7, 0.1.8 or 0.1.9, then CLEC shall not be entitled to DS1/DS3 Loops, DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements declassified by the non-
impairment status of such wire center. SBC CLEC Online shall be updated to indicate that the wire
center was the subject of an ICC determination. If CLEC withdraws its self-certification after a
dispute has been filed with the ICC, but before the ICC has made a determination regarding the
wire center designation, SBC’s wire center designation(s) shall become effective as to CLEC, and
CLEC shall not thereafter re-submit the withdrawn self-certification.
4.1.3 The Dispute Resolution process set forth in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement
shall not apply to a dispute of a CLEC self-certification. In the state of Illinois, if it desires to do so
by filing a complaint at the ICC, SBC may dispute the self-certification and associated CLEC orders
for DS1/DS3 Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport, and Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport pursuant
to the following procedures: SBC shall notify the CLEC of its intent to dispute the CLEC’s self-
certification within 30 days of the CLEC’s self-certification or within 30 days of the effective date of
this amendment, whichever is later. SBC will file the dispute for resolution with the state
Commission within 60 days of the CLEC’s self-certification or within 60 days of the effective date of
this Attachment, whichever is later. SBC shall include with the filing its direct case testimony and
exhibits which may reasonably be supplemented. To the extent this filing contains confidential
information, SBC may file that information under seal. SBC shall offer to enter into a protective
agreement under which SBC would provide such confidential information to CLEC. SBC shall
have no obligation to provide such confidential information to any Party in the absence of an
executed protective agreement. SBC will notify CLECs of the filing of such a dispute via
Accessible Letter issued within 5 business days following the filing of a dispute. If the self-
certification dispute is filed with the state Commission for resolution, the Parties will not oppose
requests for intervention by other CLECs if such request is related to the disputed wire center
designation(s). The parties agree to urge the ICC to adopt a case schedule resulting in the prompt
resolution of the dispute. During the pendency of any dispute resolution proceeding, SBC shall
continue to provide the loop or transport facility in question to CLEC at the rates in the Pricing
Schedule to the Agreement. If the CLEC withdraws its self-certification, or the state Commission
determines through arbitration or otherwise that CLEC was not entitled to the provisioned DS1/DS3
Loops or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport under Section 251,
then (with rates paid by CLEC for the affected loop or transport subject to true-up):
(a) When SBC designated relevant wire centers to be non-impaired before March 11, 2005, and a
DS1/DS3 Loop or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport is ordered
by CLEC pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Act pursuant to a self-certification on or after
March 11, 2005, and where the self-certification is reversed before the transition period
specified in Section 4.1 has expired, then CLEC shall transition the DS1/DS3 Loop or
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport according to the process in
Section 4.1. Rates between the date that the circuit is provisioned and the date the circuit is
transitioned shall be the equivalent special access rate or, where no such equivalent exists,
the rates established in Section 3.2.1.

the Accessible Letter, and where the self-certification is reversed before the transition period
specified in Section 4.1 has expired then CLEC shall transition the DS1/DS3 Loop or DS1/DS3
Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport according to the process in Section
4.1. Rates during the period between the date that is 30 days following the date that SBC
issued the Accessible Letter and the date the circuit is transitioned shall be those in Section
4.1.1.7.
(h) When SBC issues an Accessible Letter designating relevant wire centers to be non-impaired
after March 11, 2005, a DS1/DS3 Loop or DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber
Dedicated Transport is ordered pursuant to Section 251(c)(3) of the Act before SBC issued
the Accessible Letter, and where the self-certification is reversed after the transition period
specified in Section 4.1.1.5 has expired then CLEC shall transition the DS1/DS3 Loop or
DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport within 90 days of the date
on which the CLEC self-certification is reversed. Rates between the date 30 days after the
date SBC issued the Accessible Letter and the end of the transition period specified in Section
4.1.1.5 shall be those in Section 4.1.1.7. Rates during the period between the expiration of the
transition period in Section 4.1.1.5 and date the circuit is actually transitioned shall be the
equivalent special access rate or, where no such equivalent exists, the rates established in
Section 4.1.1.7. If the CLEC has not submitted an LSR or ASR, as applicable, to SBC within
90 days of the date on which the CLEC self-certification is reversed, then SBC shall be entitled
to convert the loop to an analogous SBC wholesale service of its choice or in the absence of
any analogous wholesale service to disconnect the arrangement.
4.1.4 In the event of a dispute following CLEC’s self-certification, upon request by the Commission or
CLEC, SBC will make available, subject to the appropriate state or federal protective order, and
other reasonable safeguards, all documentation and all data upon which SBC intends to rely.
4.1.5 When more than 60 days from the issuance of an SBC designation of a wire center as non-
impaired has elapsed, and if there has been no prior ICC determination of non-impairment as to
the applicable wire center(s), CLEC can thereafter still self-certify for the purpose of ordering new
loop and transport facilities. SBC may dispute CLEC’s self-certification as described in Section
4.1.3 through 4.1.4 and SBC will accept and provision the applicable loop and transport orders for
the CLEC providing the self certification during a dispute resolution process.
4.2 The provisions of Section 3.2.2, 3.2.2.1, 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.3 shall apply to the transition of DS1/DS3
Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements impacted by wire
center designation(s). Requested transitions of DS1/DS3 Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark
Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements shall be performed in a manner that reasonably minimizes the
disruption or degradation to CLEC’s customer’s service, and all applicable charges shall apply. Cross-
connects provided by SBC in conjunction with such Loops and/or Transport shall be billed at applicable
wholesale rates (i.e. if conversion is to an access product, they will be charged at applicable access rates,
as of the date of conversion). Cross-connects that are not associated with such transitioned DS1/DS3

High-Capacity Loops, DS1/DS3 Dedicated Transport or Dark Fiber Dedicated Transport arrangements
shall not be re-priced.
4.3 Intentionally left blank.
4.4 A Building that is served by both an impaired wire center and a Non-Impaired Wire Center and that is not
located in the serving area of the non-impaired wire center will continue to have Affected Elements
available from the impaired wire center and support incremental moves, adds, and changes otherwise
permitted by the Agreement, as amended.
4.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, including any amendments to the Agreement,
at the end of the Applicable Transitional Period, unless CLEC has submitted a disconnect/discontinuance
LSR or ASR, as applicable, under Section 3.2.2 above, and if CLEC and SBC ILLINOIS have failed to
reach agreement under Section 3.2.2.3 above as to a substitute service arrangement or element, then
SBC may, at its sole option, disconnect Dark Fiber element(s), whether previously provided alone or in
combination with or as part of any other arrangement, or convert the subject element(s), whether alone or
in combination with or as part of any other arrangement to an analogous resale or access service, if
available at rates applicable to such analogous service or arrangement.
4.6 Whenever SBC updates its wire center list pursuant to Section 4.1.1.1 and in the course of that analysis
gathers and/or reviews information upon which said updates are based, SBC shall make available to
CLEC, on a confidential basis, information advising when it believes a wire center has reached 90% of the
number of Business Lines needed for the wire center to be classified as a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 Wire Center.
In addition, SBC will specify which wire centers it considers to have 2 Fiber-Based Collocators and 3
Fiber-Based Collocators. This information shall only be used by CLEC for planning its transition off of the
UNE loops and transport it purchases from SBC.
5.0 Commingling and Commingled Arrangements.
5.1 SBC shall permit CLEC to Commingle a UNE or a combination of UNEs with facilities or services obtained
at wholesale from SBC. For the Commingled Arrangements listed in the Section 5.1, and any
Commingled Arrangements voluntarily (i.e., not the result of state commission order) made available by
SBC in the future in any of its 13 SBC ILEC states, SBC shall make such Commingled Arrangements
available in Illinois. In addition, to the extent SBC is ordered by a state commission in any of the five SBC
Midwest states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin) to make additional Commingled
Arrangements available, SBC shall also make such Commingled Arrangements available in Illinois, as
long as the UNE or combination of UNEs and the facilities or services being obtained at wholesale for that
commingled arrangement are available in Illinois. The types of Commingled Arrangements which SBC is
required to provide as of the date on which this Amendment is effective will be posted on CLEC Online,
and updated when new Commingling Arrangements are made available. The following SBC Commingled
Arrangements have been posted to CLEC Online as available and fully tested on an end-to-end basis,
i.e., from ordering through provisioning and billing:
i. UNE DS-0 Loop connected to a channelized Special Access DS1 Interoffice Facility, via a special
access 1/0 mux
ii. UNE DS1 Loop connected to a channelized Special Access DS3 Interoffice Facility, via a special
access 3/1 mux#
iii. UNE DS3 Loop connected to a non-concatenated Special Access Higher Capacity Interoffice
Facility (e.g., SONET Service)#
iv. UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport connected to a channelized Special Access DS3 Loop#
v. UNE DS3 Dedicated Transport connected to a non-concatenated Special Access Higher Capacity
Loop (i.e., SONET Service)#
vi. Special Access Loop connected to channelized UNE DS1 Dedicated Transport, via a 1/0 UNE mux
vii. Special Access DS1 loop connected to channelized UNE DS3 Dedicated Transport, via a 3/1 UNE
mux#

x. UNE DS3 Loop connected to a non-channelized Special Access DS3 Interoffice Facility or a UNE
DS3 Interoffice Transport Facility connected to a DS3 Special Access Loop#
xi. UNE DS3 Dedicated Transport connected to a non-channelized Special Access DS3 Loop#
xii. Special Access DS1 channel termination connected to non-channelized UNE DS1 Dedicated
Transport#
xiii. While not a commingling arrangement, SBC will support the connection of high-capacity loops to a
special access multiplexer.
# Indicates that FCC’s eligibility criteria of 47 C.F.R. § 51.318(b) applies, including the collocation
requirement.
5.1.1 To the extent that SBC requires the CLEC to submit orders for the Commingling Arrangements
included in 5.1 (i) through (xii) manually, the mechanized service order charge shall be applicable.
5.1.2 For any Commingling Arrangement the CLEC desires that is not included in Section 5.1 of this
Attachment, or subsequently established by SBC, CLEC shall request any such desired
Commingling Arrangement and SBC shall respond pursuant to the Bona Fide Request Process
(BFR) as outlined in the underlying Agreement. Through the BFR process, once the Parties agree
that the development will be undertaken to make a new Commingling Arrangement available, SBC
will work with the CLEC to process orders for new Commingling Arrangements on a manual basis
pending the completion of systems development.
5.2 Upon request and to the extent provided by Applicable Law and the provisions of the Amended Agreement,
SBC shall permit CLEC to connect a Section 251 UNE or a combination of Section 251 UNEs with
facilities or services obtained at wholesale from SBC (including access services) and/or with compatible
network components or services provided by CLEC or third parties, including, without limitation, those
Commingled Arrangements consistent with Section 5.0 of this Attachment.
5.3 For example, without limitation of this provision, SBC will, upon request, connect loops leased or owned
by CLEC to a third-party’s collocation arrangement upon being presented with documentation that the
CLEC has authorization from the third party to connect loops. In addition, SBC will, upon request,
connect an EEL leased by CLEC to a third-party’s collocation upon presentation of documentation of
authorization. In addition, SBC will, upon request and documentation of authorization, connect third-
party loops and EELs to CLEC collocation sites. An EEL provided hereunder may terminate to a third
party's collocation arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 6.3.4 upon presentation of
documentation of authorization by that third party. Subject to the other provisions hereof, Section 251
UNE loops may be accessed via cross-connection to a third party's Section 251(c)(6) collocation
arrangement upon presentation of documentation of authorization by that third party.
5.4 Upon request, and to the extent required by Applicable Law and the applicable provisions of this
Attachment, SBC shall perform the functions necessary to Commingle a Section 251 UNE or a
combination of Section 251 UNEs with one or more facilities or services that CLEC has obtained at
wholesale from SBC (as well as requests where CLEC also wants SBC to complete the actual
Commingling), except that SBC shall have no obligation to perform the functions necessary to Commingle
(or to complete the actual Commingling) if (i) it is not technically feasible, including that network reliability
and security would be impaired; (ii) SBC’s ability to retain responsibility for the management, control and
performance of its network would be impaired, or (iii) it would undermine the ability of other
telecommunications carriers to obtain access to UNEs or to interconnect with SBC’s network. If SBC
denies a Commingling request on the basis of any of these conditions, and SBC’s denial is challenged,
SBC shall have the burden of proving its denial was appropriate. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement and this Attachment, CLEC may connect, combine, or otherwise attach UNEs and
combinations of UNEs to wholesale services obtained from SBC, and SBC shall not deny access to
Page 269 of 354

ATTACHMENT TO AMENDMENT – ICC DOCKET 05-0442 TRO/TRRO COLLABORATIVE/THE ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY

SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
Section 251 UNEs and combinations of Section 251 UNEs on the grounds that such facilities or services
are somehow connected, combined or otherwise attached to wholesale services obtained from SBC.
5.5 SBC shall only charge CLEC the recurring and non-recurring charges in commingling service order
processes where physical work is required to create the commingled arrangement as set forth in the
Pricing Schedule attached to this Agreement applicable to the Section 251 UNE(s), facilities or services
that CLEC has obtained at wholesale from SBC. Where there is no physical work and a record order type
is necessary to create the commingled arrangement, only such record order charge shall apply.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or any SBC tariff, the recurring and non-recurring
charges applicable to each portion of a Commingled facility or service shall not exceed the rate for the
portion if it were purchased separately unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties pursuant to the BFR
process.
5.6 When CLEC purchases Commingled Arrangements from SBC, SBC shall charge CLEC element-by-
element and service-by-service rates. SBC shall not be required to, and shall not, provide “ratcheting” as
a result of Commingling or a Commingled Arrangement, as that term is used in the FCC’s Triennial
Review Order. As a general matter, “Ratcheting” is a pricing mechanism that involves billing a single
circuit at multiple rates to develop a single, blended rate.
5.7 Intentionally left blank.
5.8 SBC agrees that CLEC may request to Commingle the following elements to the extent that SBC is
required to provide them pursuant to Section 271 of the Act (“271 Elements”), including but not limited to:
(i) Local Loop transmission from the central office to the End Users’ premises (unbundled from local
switching or other services), and (ii) Local transport from the trunk side of a wireline Local Exchange
Carrier switch (unbundled from switching or other services). SBC shall provide CLEC with access to
these 271 Elements and 13-801 Network Elements in accordance with Section 13.0 or 14.0 of this
Attachment, as applicable.
5.9 Unless expressly prohibited by the terms of this Attachment, SBC shall permit CLEC to connect an
unbundled Network Element or a Combination of unbundled Network Elements with wholesale (i) services
obtained from SBC, (ii) services obtained from third parties or (iii) facilities provided by CLEC. For
purposes of example only, CLEC may Commingle unbundled Network Elements or Combinations of
unbundled Network Elements with other services and facilities including, but not limited to, switched and
special access services, or services purchased under resale arrangements with SBC.
5.10 With respect to a Commingled Arrangement, CLEC will be responsible for all Channel Facility Assignment
(“CFA”) and/or Assigned Point of Termination (“APOT”), The CFA/APOT are the assignments CLEC
provides to SBC from CLEC’s collocation arrangement.
6.0 EELs.
6.1 SBC agrees to make available to CLEC Enhanced Extended Links (“EELs”) on the terms and conditions
set forth below. SBC shall not impose any additional conditions or limitations upon obtaining access to
EELs or to any other UNE combinations other than those set out in this Agreement. Except as provided
below in this Section 6.0 and subject to this Section 6.1, SBC shall provide access to Section 251 UNEs
and combinations of Section 251 UNEs without regard to whether CLEC seeks access to the UNEs to
establish a new circuit or to convert an existing circuit from a service to UNEs provided the rates, terms
and conditions under which such Section 251 UNEs are to be provided are included within the CLEC’s
underlying Agreement.
6.2 An EEL that consists of a combination of voice grade to DS-0 level UNE local loops combined with a UNE
DS1 or DS3 Dedicated Transport (a “Low-Capacity EEL”) shall not be required to satisfy the Eligibility
Criteria set out in this Sections 6.2 and 6.3. If an EEL is made up of a combination that includes one or
more of the following described combinations (the “High-Cap EELs”), each circuit to be provided to each
customer is required to terminate in a collocation arrangement that meets the requirements of Section
6.3.4 below (e.g., the end of the UNE Dedicated Transport that is opposite the end connected to the UNE
Page 270 of 354

120605
loop must be accessed by CLEC at such a collocation arrangement via a cross-connect unless the EEL is
Commingled with a wholesale service in which case the wholesale service must terminate at the
collocation). A High-Cap EEL is either:
(A) an unbundled DS1 Loop in combination, or Commingled, with a dedicated DS1 transport or
dedicated DS3 or higher transport facility or service, or to an unbundled DS3 Loop in combination, or
Commingled, with a dedicated DS3 or higher transport facility or service; or
(B) an unbundled dedicated DS1 transport facility in combination, or Commingled, with an unbundled
DS1 Loop or a DS1 channel termination service, or to an unbundled dedicated DS3 transport facility
in combination, or Commingled, with an unbundled DS1 Loop or a DS1 channel termination service,
or to an unbundled DS3 Loop or a DS3 or higher channel termination service.
6.3 SBC shall make Low Capacity EELs available to CLEC without restriction, except as otherwise provided
in the Agreement or this Attachment. SBC shall provide access to the High-Cap EELS (Sections 6.2(A)
and 6.2(B)) only when CLEC satisfies the following service Eligibility Criteria:
6.3.1. CLEC (directly and not via an affiliate) has received state certification (or equivalent regulatory
approval, as applicable) from the Commission to provide local voice service in the area being
served. By issuing an order for an EEL, CLEC certifies that it has the necessary processes and
procedures in place to certify that it will meet the EELs Eligibility Criteria for each such order it
submits. SBC hereby acknowledges that CLEC has received sufficient state certifications to satisfy
these criteria.
6.3.1.1 At CLEC’s option, CLEC may also or alternatively provide self certification via email or
letter to SBC. Provided that SBC has received such self certification from CLEC, SBC shall
not deny CLEC access to High-Capacity EELs. Anything to the contrary in this Section
notwithstanding, CLEC shall not be required to provide certification to obtain access to Low
Capacity EELs, other Combinations or individual unbundled Network Elements.
6.3.1.1.1 This alternative method of certification-by-order applies only to certifications of
Eligibility Criteria set forth in this Section 6, and not to self-certifications relative to
routes, Buildings and wire centers.
6.3.2 The following Eligibility Criteria must be satisfied for each High-Cap EEL, including without
limitation each DS1 circuit, each DS3 circuit, each DS1 EEL and each DS1 equivalent circuit on a
DS3 EEL in accordance with Rule 51.318(b)(2):
(i) Each circuit to be provided to each customer will be assigned a local number prior to the
provision of service over that circuit. Each DS1circuit to be provided to each end user
customer will have at least one DS-0 assigned a local telephone number (NPA-NXX-XXXX).
(ii) Each DS1-equivalent circuit on a DS3 EEL must have its own local telephone number
assignment, so that each DS3 must have at least 28 local voice telephone numbers assigned
to it;
(iii) Each DS1 equivalent circuit to be provided to each customer will have designed 911 or E911
capability prior to the provision of service over that circuit.
(iv) Each DS1 circuit to be provided to each customer will terminate in a collocation arrangement
meeting the requirements of Section 6.3.4 of this Attachment;
(v) Each DS1 circuit to be provided to each end user customer will be served by an
interconnection trunk that meets the requirements of Section 6.3.5 of this Attachment;
(vi) For each 24 DS1 EELs or other facilities having equivalent capacity, CLEC will have at least
one active DS1 local service interconnection trunk that meets the requirements of Section
6.3.5 of this Attachment; and
(vii) Each DS1 circuit to be provided to each customer will be served by a switch capable of
switching local voice traffic.

120605
6.3.3 The Eligibility Criteria set forth in this Section 6.3 shall apply to any arrangement that includes more
than one of the UNEs, facilities, or services set forth in Section 6.2, including, without limitation, to
any arrangement where one or more UNEs, facilities, or services not set forth in Section 6.2 is also
included or otherwise used in that arrangement (whether as part of a UNE combination,
Commingled Arrangement, or a Special Access to UNE Conversion), and irrespective of the
placement or sequence of them.
6.3.4 Pursuant to the collocation terms and conditions in the underlying Agreement, a collocation
arrangement meets the requirements of this Section 6.0 if it is:
(A) Established pursuant to Section 251(c)(6) of the Act and located at SBC’s premises within the
same LATA as the customer’s premises, when SBC is not the collocator; or
(B) Established pursuant to any collocation type defined in any SBC Tariff to the extent
applicable, or any applicable CLEC interconnection agreement.
(C) Located at a third party’s premises within the same LATA as the customer’s premises, when
the incumbent LEC is the collocator.
6.3.5 Pursuant to the network interconnection terms and conditions in the underlying Agreement, an
interconnection trunk meets the requirements of Sections 6.3.2(v) and (vii) of this Attachment if
CLEC will transmit the calling party’s Local Telephone Number in connection with calls exchanged
over the trunk.
6.3.6 Before (1) converting a High-Cap wholesale service to a High-Cap EEL, (2) ordering a new High-
Cap EEL Arrangement, or (3) ordering a High-Cap EEL that is comprised of Commingled
wholesale services and UNEs, CLEC must certify to all of the Eligibility Criteria set out in Section
6.3 for each circuit. To the extent the Eligibility Criteria for High Cap EELs apply, CLEC shall be
permitted to self-certify its compliance with the Eligibility Criteria by providing SBC notification
pursuant to Sections 6.3.1 and/or 6.3.1.1. Upon CLEC’s self-certification of compliance, in
accordance with this Attachment, SBC shall provide the requested EEL in accordance with this
Attachment, and shall not exercise self help to deny the provisioning of the requested EEL;
provided, however, that CLEC shall promptly share records of its compliance with the qualifying
service criteria discussed herein upon request from SBC.
6.3.7 SBC may audit CLEC’s compliance with the Eligibility Criteria by obtaining and paying for an
independent auditor to audit, on no more frequently than an annual basis, CLEC’s compliance in
Illinois with the conditions set out in Section 6. Such an audit will be initiated only to the extent
reasonably necessary to determine CLEC’s compliance with the Eligibility Criteria. For purposes of
calculating and applying an “annual basis”, “annual basis” shall mean a consecutive 12-month
period, beginning upon SBC’s written notice that an audit will be performed for Illinois.
6.3.7.1 To invoke its limited right to audit, SBC will send a Notice of Audit to CLEC, identifying
examples of particular High-Cap EELS for which SBC alleges non-compliance and the
cause upon which SBC rests its audit. The Notice of Audit shall state the proposed scope
of the audit and include all supporting documentation upon which SBC establishes the
cause that forms the basis of its belief that CLEC is non-compliant. Such Notice of Audit
will be delivered to CLEC with supporting documentation no less than thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the date upon which SBC seek to commence an audit. The Notice of Audit
shall identify the proposed independent auditor. Such auditor may not be substantially
dependent upon either Party for work.
6.3.7.2 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties (including at the time of the audit), the independent
auditor shall perform its evaluation in accordance with the standards established by the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants, which will require the auditor to perform
an “examination engagement” and issue an opinion that includes the auditor’s
determination regarding CLEC’s compliance with the Eligibility Criteria. The independent
auditor’s report will conclude whether CLEC complied in all material respects with the
Eligibility Criteria.

PAGE 18 OF 27
SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
6.3.7.3 Consistent with standard auditing practices, such audits require compliance testing
designed by the independent auditor, which typically include an examination of a sample
selected in accordance with the independent auditor’s judgment.
6.3.7.4 SBC shall provide CLEC with a copy of the independent auditor’s report within 2 business
days from the date of receipt. The independent auditor’s report shall state the scope of the
audit that was performed. If CLEC disagrees as to the findings or conclusions of the
auditor’s report, CLEC may bring a dispute directly to the ICC. Prior to bringing a dispute to
the ICC under this section, however, CLEC shall provide notice of the dispute to SBC so
that the Parties can discuss possible resolution of the dispute. Such dispute resolution
discussions shall be completed within fourteen (14) days of the date the auditor’s report
was provided to CLEC and CLEC may not initiate a dispute resolution proceeding at the
ICC until after expiration of this fourteen (14) day period. The Dispute Resolution process
set forth in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement shall not apply to a dispute
of the findings or conclusions of the auditor’s report. If the auditor’s report concludes that
CLEC failed to comply with the Eligibility Criteria for a High-Cap EEL, CLEC must true-up
any difference in payments paid to SBC and the rates and charges CLEC would have
owed SBC beginning from the date that the non-compliance of the High-Cap EEL with the
Eligibility Criteria, in whole or in part, began. CLEC shall submit orders to SBC to either
convert all noncompliant High-Cap EELs to the equivalent or substantially similar
wholesale service or disconnect non-compliant High-Cap EELs. Conversion and/or
disconnect orders shall be submitted within 30 days of the date on which CLEC receives a
copy of the auditor’s report and CLEC shall begin paying the trued-up and correct rates
and charges for each converted High-Cap EEL beginning with the next billing cycle
following SBC’s acceptance of such order, unless CLEC disputes the auditor’s finding and
initiates a proceeding at the ICC for resolution of the dispute, in which case no changes
shall be made until the ICC rules on the dispute. However CLEC shall pay the disputed
amount into an escrow account governed by an appropriate joint escrow arrangement,
pending resolution. With respect to any noncompliant High-Cap EEL for which CLEC fails
to submit a conversion or disconnect order or dispute the auditor’s finding to the ICC within
such 30-day time period, SBC may initiate and effect such a conversion on its own without
any further consent by CLEC. If converted, CLEC must convert the non-compliant High-
Cap EEL to an equivalent or substantially similar wholesale service, or group of wholesale
services. Reasonable steps will be taken to avoid disruption to CLEC’s customer’s service
or degradation in service quality in the case of conversion. Following conversion, CLEC
shall make the correct payments on a going-forward basis. In no event shall rates set
under Section 252(d)(1) apply for the use of any High-Cap EEL for any period in which
High-Cap EEL does not meet the Eligibility Criteria for that High-Cap EEL. Furthermore, if
CLEC disputes the auditor’s finding and initiates a proceeding at the ICC and if the ICC
upholds the auditor’s finding, any disputed amounts held in escrow shall be paid to SBC
and SBC shall retain any disputed amounts already paid by CLEC.
6.3.7.5 If the auditor’s report concludes that CLEC failed to comply with the Eligibility Criteria for
any High-Cap EELs, CLEC will reimburse SBC for a fraction of the cost of the independent
auditor equal to the number of High-Cap EELs that the auditor’s report finds to be non-
compliant divided by the total number of all High-Cap EELs leased by CLEC that were the
subject of the audit. All costs of the independent auditor for which SBC seeks
reimbursement shall be commercially reasonable. The CLEC reimbursement in this
Section 6.3.7.5 is only applicable where there is an auditor finding of noncompliance and
no Party challenges this finding with the ICC, or if there is an auditor finding of
noncompliance followed by a Party filing a challenge to this finding with the ICC followed by
the ICC affirming the auditor finding of noncompliance.

120605
6.3.7.6 To the extent the auditor’s report concludes that CLEC complied with the Eligibility Criteria
for all High-Cap EELS that were audited, SBC must reimburse CLEC for all of its
reasonable costs associated with the audit.
6.3.7.7 CLEC will maintain the appropriate documentation to support its self certifications of
compliance with the Eligibility Criteria pursuant to the document retention terms and
conditions of the underlying Agreement. To the extent the underlying Agreement does not
include document retention terms and conditions, CLEC will maintain the appropriate
documentation to support its self certifications for as long as the Agreement is operative,
plus a period of two years.
6.3.7.8 SBC can seek an audit for any particular High-Cap EEL for the period which is the shorter
of (i) the period subsequent to the last day of the period covered by the audit which was
last performed, provided that the High-Cap EEL was within the scope of such prior audit as
stated in the independent auditor’s report. and (ii) the twenty-four (24) month period
immediately preceding the date notice of such requested audit is provided to CLEC, but in
any event not prior to the date the circuit was established.
6.3.7.9 In the event the underlying Agreement does not contain a backbilling statute of limitations,
backbilling pursuant to Section 6.0 is limited to two years prior to the date of the Notice of
Audit.
6.4 Provisioning for EELs
6.4.1 With respect to an EEL, CLEC will be responsible for all Channel Facility Assignment (“CFA”)
and/or Assigned Point of Termination (“APOT”). The CFA/APOT are the assignments CLEC
provides to SBC from CLEC’s collocation arrangement.
6.4.2 SBC will perform all maintenance functions on EELs during a mutually agreeable timeframe to test
and make adjustments appropriate for maintaining the UNEs in satisfactory operating condition. No
credit will be allowed for normal service disruptions involved during such testing and adjustments.
Standard credit practices will apply to any service disruptions not directly associated with the testing
and adjustment process.
6.4.3 EELs may utilize multiplexing capabilities. The High Cap EEL may be obtained by CLEC if
available and if CLEC meets all Eligibility Criteria set forth in this Section 6.0.
6.5 Other than the Eligibility Criteria set forth in this Section, SBC shall not impose limitations, restrictions, or
requirements on requests for the use of UNEs for the service CLEC seeks to offer.
7.0 Availability of HFPL for Purposes of Line Sharing.
7.1 SBC shall make available to CLEC (or its proper successor or assign pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement) line sharing over the High Frequency Portion of the Loop (“HFPL”) in accordance with the
TRO and associated Rules 51.319(a)(1)(i)-(iv) and (b)(1).
7.2 Grandfathered and New End-Users: SBC will continue to provide access to the HFPL, where: (i) prior to
October 2, 2003, CLEC began providing DSL service to a particular end-user customer and has not
ceased providing DSL service to that customer (“Grandfathered End-Users”); and/or (ii) CLEC began
providing xDSL service to a particular end-user customer between October 2, 2003, and December 3,
2004 (“New End-Users”). Such access to the HFPL shall be provided at the same monthly recurring rate
that SBC charged prior to October 2, 2003 as set forth in the Pricing Schedule of the Agreement, and
shall continue for Grandfathered End-Users until CLEC’s xDSL-base service to the end-user customer is
disconnected for whatever reason, and as to New End-Users the earlier of: (1) CLEC’s xDSL-base of
service to the customer is disconnected for whatever reason; or (2) October 2, 2006. Beginning October
2, 2006, SBC shall have no obligation to continue to provide the HFPL for CLEC to provide xDSL-based
service to any New End-Users that CLEC began providing xDSL-based service to over the HFPL on or
after October 2, 2003 and before December 3, 2004. Rather, effective October 2, 2006, CLEC must
provide xDSL-based service to any such new end-user customer(s) via a line splitting arrangement, over

a stand-alone xDSL Loop purchased from SBC, or through an alternate arrangement, if any, that the
Parties may negotiate. Any references to the HFPL being made available as an unbundled network
element or “UNE” are hereby deleted from the underlying Agreement.
8.0 Routine Network Modifications.
8.1 Routine Network Modifications – UNE Local Loops
8.1.1 SBC shall make all routine network modifications to UNE Local Loop facilities used by CLEC
where the requested UNE Local Loop facility has already been constructed. SBC shall perform all
routine network modifications to UNE Local Loop facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without
regard to whether the UNE Local Loop facility being accessed was constructed on behalf, or in
accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
8.1.2 A routine network modification is an activity that SBC regularly undertakes for its own customers.
Routine network modifications include, but are not limited to, rearranging or splicing of cable;
adding an equipment case; adding a doubler or repeater; adding a smart jack; installing a repeater
shelf; adding a line card; deploying a new multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer; and
attaching electronic and other equipment that the ILEC ordinarily attaches to activate such loops
for its own customers. Routine network modifications may entail activities such as accessing
manholes, splicing into existing cable, deploying bucket trucks to reach aerial cable, and installing
equipment casings.
8.1.3 Routine network modifications do not include the construction of an altogether new loop; installing
new aerial or buried cable; securing permits or rights-of-way; or constructing and/or placing new
manholes or conduits or installing new terminals. SBC is not obligated to perform such activities
for CLEC.
8.1.4 Intentionally omitted.
8.1.5 SBC shall provide routine network modifications at the rates, terms and conditions set out in this
Attachment, and in the state specific Pricing Schedule. SBC shall impose charges for routine
network modifications in instances where such charges are not included in any costs already
recovered through existing, applicable recurring and non-recurring charges. SBC shall expressly
certify that no costs recovered by routine network modification charges are recovered by any other
rate or charge. The resulting ICB rates shall continue to apply to such routine network
modifications unless and until the Parties negotiate specific rates based upon actual time and
materials costs for such routine network modifications or specific rates are otherwise established
for such routine network modifications through applicable state commission proceedings. In the
event the ICC establishes or approves a rate for a routine network modification other than adding a
doubler or repeaters, installing an equipment shelf and any other necessary work and parts
associated with a repeater shelf to the extent such equipment is not present on the loop or
transport facility when ordered, or splicing of dark fiber, any difference between that rate and the
ICB rate actually charged by SBC Illinois for such routine network modification within the two (2)
years prior to the date the ICC establishes or approves a rate shall be subject to true up, unless the
Parties agree to a different period for such true-up or the ICC's order establishing or approving the
rate establishes, based on clear and convincing evidence presented by the Party advocating a
different true-up period, that a different true-up period should apply. The Parties acknowledge that
they have agreed to the 2 year true-up period set forth above in the interests of certainty and to
minimize disputes.
8.2 Routine Network Modifications –UNE Dedicated Transport and Dark Fiber
8.2.1 SBC shall make all routine network modifications to UNE Dedicated Transport including Dark Fiber
facilities used by CLEC where the requested UNE Dedicated Transport including Dark Fiber
facilities have already been constructed. SBC shall perform all routine network modifications to
UNE Dedicated Transport including Dark Fiber facilities in a nondiscriminatory fashion, without

regard to whether the UNE Dedicated Transport including Dark Fiber facility being accessed was
constructed on behalf, or in accordance with the specifications, of any carrier.
8.2.2 A routine network modification is an activity that SBC regularly undertakes for its own customers.
Routine network modifications include, but are not limited to, rearranging or splicing of cable,
adding an equipment case, adding a doubler or repeater, adding a smart jack, installing a repeater
shelf, adding a line card and deploying a new multiplexer or reconfiguring an existing multiplexer.
Routine network modifications may entail activities such as accessing manholes, deploying bucket
trucks to reach aerial cable and installing equipment casings.
8.2.3 Routine network modifications do not include the construction of new UNE Dedicated Transport
including Dark Fiber; installing new aerial or buried cable; securing permits or rights-of-way;
constructing and/or placing new manholes or conduits or installing new terminals. SBC is not
obligated to perform the above stated activities for CLEC. However, when CLEC purchases Dark
Fiber, SBC shall not be obligated to provide the optronics for the purpose of lighting the Dark Fiber.
9.0 Batch Hot Cut Process: The “Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings” are new hot cut processes developed after
multi-state collaboration between SBC and interested CLECs. The Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings are
available to CLECs in addition to any hot cut processes available pursuant to CLEC’s underlying interconnection
agreement. The Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings are designed to provide additional hot cut options for
conversions of voice service provisioned by SBC as retail, resale, UNE-P or Local Wholesale Complete™
(including instances where such arrangement is provided through a commercial arrangement) to non-SBC-
provided switching. Detailed information and documentation regarding each of the Batch Hot Cut Process
Offerings (including order guidelines, supported ordering scenarios, volume limitations (where applicable), and
available due date intervals/cut times) is contained on SBC’s CLEC Online website (or successor website). Any
future enhancements or modifications to SBC’s Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings will be made in accordance
with SBC’s Change Management Process. SBC will ensure that its Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings comply
with all applicable ICC batch cut rulings. Any changes to the volumes, provisioning, intervals or prices of SBC’s
Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings shall be incorporated into the Agreement by amendment, based on
negotiations between SBC and CLEC, or, if necessary, in accordance with Section 252. Any disputes between
SBC and CLEC relating to SBC’s Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings shall be handled in accordance with the
dispute resolution processes in the Agreement.
9.1 General:
9.1.1 Enhanced Daily Process: The “Enhanced Daily Process” option is designed to support hot cuts
associated with new customer acquisitions. SBC places no limitations on the number of Enhanced
Daily Process orders CLEC may place per day.
9.1.2 Defined Batch Hot Cut Process – The “Defined Batch Hot Cut Process” is designed to support hot
cuts associated with the conversion of CLEC’s embedded base customers from service
provisioned using SBC -provided switching to service provisioned using CLEC-provided switching.
CLEC may request up to one hundred hot cuts per day per central office using the Defined Batch
Hot Cut Process. The maximum number of Defined Batch Hot Cut Process requests that SBC
must accept for a single day in a single central office for all CLECs combined is two hundred lines.
9.1.3 Bulk Project Offering – The “Bulk Project Offering” is designed to support large volumes of hot cuts
associated with the conversion of CLEC’s embedded base customers from service provisioned
using SBC -provided switching to service provisioned using CLEC -provided switching.
9.1.4 The Coordinated Hot Cut (“CHC”) and Frame Due Time (“FDT”) options for the Enhanced Daily
Process, the Defined Batch Process, and the Bulk Project offering (collectively, the “Batch Hot Cut
Offerings”) are specific to these processes and may differ from CHC and FDT options offered for
other hot cut offerings. The CHC option for the Batch Hot Cut Offerings allows a CLEC to request
that SBC reserve central office and local operation personnel to coordinate with the CLEC during a
given time frame to migrate the end user with a minimum of downtime. The FDT option for the
Page 276 of 354

ATTACHMENT TO AMENDMENT – ICC DOCKET 05-0442 TRO/TRRO COLLABORATIVE/THE ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY
PAGE 22 OF 27
SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
Batch Hot Cut Offerings allows CLEC to request that SBC perform the hot cut anytime within a
given time frame (typically an hour) on the loop due date.
9.1.5 If the CLEC is acting as a wholesale switching provider to the end user's retail voice provider, the
CLEC will submit Batch Hot Cut Process orders using the CLEC's OCN and the end user's retail
voice provider will not issue orders to SBC. SBC will accept the Batch Hot Cut order from the
CLEC acting as a wholesale switching provider and perform the batch hot cuts that cross-connect
the unbundled loops to the wholesale CLEC's collocation. If CLEC requests Batch Hot Cuts while
acting as a wholesale switching provider, SBC will assess the applicable charges for the Batch Hot
Cut to CLEC, not to the retail voice provider. When CLEC is acting as a wholesale switching
provider, it may include requests for batch hot cuts for lines currently served by one or more retail
CLECs, as well as lines from its own embedded base, within the same batch.
9.2 Pricing for Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings
9.2.1 The per line rates applicable for each available Batch Hot Cut Process Offering option are set forth
on the attached Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings Pricing Schedule, which is incorporated herein by
this reference. The rates contained in the Batch Hot Cut Process Offering Pricing Schedule only
apply to Batch Hot Cut Process Offering hot cut requests. To the extent that the rate application
and/or rate structure for the Batch Hot Cut Process Offerings conflicts with provisions contained in
CLEC’s underlying interconnection agreement, the rate structure and/or rate application contained
in the Batch Hot Cut Process Offering Pricing Schedule prevails for Batch Hot Cut Process Offering
requests only. This amendment does not modify the rate structure or rates applicable for any hot
cuts requested using other hot cut processes supported by CLEC’s underlying interconnection
Agreement.
10.0 Conversions
10.1 Conversion of Wholesale Services to UNEs
10.1.1 Upon request, SBC shall convert a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services, to the
equivalent UNE, or combination of UNEs, that is available to CLEC under terms and conditions
set forth in this Attachment, so long as the CLEC and the wholesale service, or group of wholesale
services, and the UNEs, or combination of UNEs, that would result from the conversion meet the
Eligibility Criteria that may be applicable. (By way of example only, the statutory conditions would
constitute one such eligibility criterion.)
10.1.2 Where processes for the conversion requested pursuant to this Attachment are not already in
place, SBC will develop and implement processes, subject to any associated rates, terms and
conditions. The Parties will comply with any applicable Change Management guidelines. Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, such conversion shall be completed in a manner so
that the correct charge is reflected on the next billing cycle after CLEC’s request. SBC agrees that
CLEC may request the conversion of such special access circuits on a “project” basis. For other
types of conversions, until such time as the Parties have agreed upon processes for such
conversions, SBC agrees to process CLEC’s conversion requests on a case-by-case basis and
without delay.
10.1.2.1 For UNE conversion orders for which SBC has either a) not developed a process or b)
developed a process that falls out for manual handling, SBC will charge CLEC the
Electronic Service Order (Flow Thru) Record charge for processing CLEC's orders until
such process has been developed and CLEC agrees to immediately use the electronic
process. Then SBC may charge service order charges and/or record change charges, as
applicable.
10.1.2.2 Except as agreed to by the Parties or otherwise provided hereunder, SBC shall not
impose any untariffed termination charges, or any disconnection fees, re-connection fees,
or charges associated with converting an existing wholesale service or group of wholesale

120605
services to UNEs or combinations of UNEs. SBC may charge applicable service order
charges or record change charges.
10.1.3 SBC will complete CLEC conversion orders in accordance with the OSS guidelines in place in
support of the conversion that the CLEC is requesting with any disruption to the end user’s service
reduced to a minimum or, where technically feasible given current systems and processes, no
disruption should occur. Where disruption is unavoidable due to technical considerations, SBC
shall accomplish such conversions in a manner to minimize any disruption detectable to the end
user. Where necessary or appropriate, SBC and CLEC shall coordinate such conversions
10.1.3.1 When converting from a wholesale service to a UNE or combination of UNEs, the
applicable non-recurring charges, if any, as governed by this Agreement and/or Tariff from
which the UNE or UNE combination being converted to is ordered, shall apply.
10.1.4 SBC shall perform any conversion from a wholesale service or group of wholesale services to a
unbundled Network Element or Combination of unbundled Network Elements in such a way so that
no service interruption as a result of the conversion will be discernable to the end user customers.
10.1.5 Except as provided in 10.1.2, in requesting a conversion of an SBC service, CLEC must follow the
standard guidelines and ordering requirements that are applicable to converting the particular SBC
service sought to be converted.
11.0 FTTH Loops, FTTC Loops, Hybrid Loops and Retirement of Copper Loops.
11.1 The following terms shall apply to FTTH and FTTC Loops.
11.1.1 New Builds. SBC shall not be required to provide nondiscriminatory access to a FTTH or FTTC
Loop on an unbundled basis where SBC has deployed such a Loop to premises that previously
were not served by any SBC Loop.
11.1.2 Overbuilds. SBC shall not be required to provide nondiscriminatory access to a FTTH or FTTC
Loop on an unbundled basis when SBC has deployed such a Loop parallel to, or in replacement of,
an existing copper Loop facility, except that:
(a) SBC shall maintain the existing copper Loop connected to the particular customer premises
after deploying the FTTH/FTTC Loop and provide nondiscriminatory access to that copper
Loop on an unbundled basis unless SBC retires the copper Loop pursuant to the terms of
Section 11.1.3.
(b) If SBC maintains the existing copper Loop pursuant to this Section 11.1.2, SBC need not
incur any expenses to ensure that the existing copper loop remains capable of transmitting
signals. Prior to receiving a request for access by CLEC, upon receipt of a request for access
pursuant to this section, SBC shall restore the copper loop to serviceable condition and will
maintain the copper loop when such loop is being purchased by CLEC on an unbundled basis
under the provisions of this Attachment.
(c) For each copper loop retired pursuant to Section 11.1.3 below, SBC shall offer to provide
nondiscriminatory access to a 64 kilobits per second transmission paths capable of voice
grade service over the FTTH/FTTC Loop on an unbundled basis on the same rates and terms
applicable under the Agreement to a DS-0 Local Loop to the same premises were such a loop
available. CLEC is entitled to request any number of 64kbps paths up to the number of copper
loops or subloops previously serving the customer premises that were retired.
11.1.3 Prior to retiring any copper loop or copper subloop that has been replaced with a FTTH/FTTC
Loop, SBC must comply with the network disclosure requirements set forth in Section 251(c)(5) of
the Act and in Rules 51.325 through 51.335 and any applicable state requirements. If a CLEC is
leasing a copper loop when SBC submits its notice pursuant to the foregoing sentence, SBC shall
also provide CLEC with a copy of such short term notice via an accessible letter. In addition, SBC
may not retire a copper loop currently leased by a CLEC unless SBC performs, upon CLEC
request, a line station transfer (“LST”) where an alternative copper or non-packetized hybrid (TDM)

PAGE 24 OF 27
SBC ILLINOIS/GLOBALCOM, INC.
120605
loop is available. In order to request an LST, CLEC must have the rates, terms and conditions for
an LST in the underlying Agreement. CLEC will be billed and shall pay for such an LST at the
rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule. If no such rates, terms and conditions exist in the underlying
Agreement, CLEC can request an LST pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions in SBC’s
Generic Interconnection Agreement.
11.1.4 SBC shall not engineer the transmission capabilities of its network in a manner, or engage in any
policy, practice, or procedure, that disrupts or degrades CLEC’s access to, or ability to tap the full
capabilities of, a local loop or subloop. As such, SBC’s modification of loop plant (e.g., removing
copper feeder facilities and stranding CLEC’s access to distribution subloop) shall not limit or
restrict CLEC’s ability to access all of the loop features, functions and capabilities, including DSL
capabilities, nor increase the price of any loop used by, or to be used by, CLEC. Furthermore,
SBC will comply with Rules 51.325 through 51.335, and any applicable state requirements.
11.2 Hybrid Loops Generally
11.2.1 Broadband Services. When CLEC seeks access to a Hybrid Loop for the provision of broadband
services SBC shall provide CLEC with nondiscriminatory access to the TDM features, functions,
and capabilities of that Hybrid Loop, including DS1 or DS3 capacity (subject to CLEC’s self-
certification in accordance with Section 4 of this Attachment), regardless of the type of DLC
systems (e.g., NGDLC, UDLC, IDLC) on an unbundled basis, to establish a complete transmission
path between the SBC central office and an end user customer premise. This access shall include
access to all features, functions, and capabilities of the Hybrid Loop to the extent that such are not
used to transmit packetized information. In instances where both TDM and packetized functionality
exist on the Hybrid Loop, SBC is required to only make the TDM functionality available on an
unbundled basis. The unbundling obligation associated with DS-1 loops is not limited by the rules
adopted in the TRO for hybrid loops.
11.2.2 Narrowband Services. When CLEC seeks access to a Hybrid Loop for the provision to its
customer of narrowband services, SBC shall either (a) provide nondiscriminatory access to a spare
home-run copper Loop serving that customer on an unbundled basis, or (b) provide
nondiscriminatory access, on an unbundled basis, to an entire Hybrid Loop capable of voice-grade
service (i.e., equivalent to DS-0 capacity), using time division multiplexing technology at a rate no
higher than the DS-0 loop rate in the Pricing Schedule.
11.2.3 Rates. The non-recurring and recurring rates for Hybrid Loops provided pursuant to Sections
11.2.1 and 11.2.2 shall be no higher than for a copper or fiber loop of comparable capacity as set
forth in the Pricing Schedule.
11.2.4 IDLC Hybrid Loops. Where a CLEC requests an unbundled loop to a premises to which SBC has
deployed an IDLC Hybrid Loop, SBC can only charge the CLEC the least cost technically feasible
method of unbundled access. SBC may not impose special construction or other non-standard
charges (which does not include routine network modification charges permitted under Section
8.1.5 of this Attachment) to provision unbundled loops where it has deployed IDLC except as
provided under this Agreement.
11.2.5 Feeder. SBC shall not be required to provide access to the feeder portion of a Loop on an
unbundled, standalone basis.
12.0 Use of Section 251 Unbundled Network Elements.
12.1 Except as provided in Section 6.0 of this Attachment, SBC shall not impose limitations, restrictions, or
requirements on requests for, or the use of, unbundled network elements provided under Section 251 for
the service CLEC seeks to offer.
12.2 CLEC may not access an unbundled network element under Section 251 for the exclusive provision of
mobile wireless services or interexchange services.

12.3 A CLEC that accesses and uses an unbundled network element provided under Section 251 consistent
with paragraph 12.2 may provide any telecommunications services over the same unbundled network
elements.
13.0 Section 271 Obligations.
13.1 Intentionally left blank.
13.2 Intentionally left blank.
13.3 Intentionally left blank.
13.4 Nothing in this Attachment shall expand or contract SBC’s obligation, if any, to provide CLEC access to
network elements pursuant to Section 271 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Nothing in this
Attachment should be interpreted, or deemed as grounds for, amending the rates, terms and conditions (if
any) by which SBC provides 271 Elements to CLEC. Provided, however, CLEC may request that any
Section 251 unbundled network element or combination of network elements (including any TRO Affected
Element or TRO Remand Affected Element) be reclassified as a corresponding 271 Element or Elements,
provided that SBC is obligated to provide such elements under Section 271 under the Agreement. SBC
will perform such reclassification at no charge.
14.0 Section 13-801 Obligations.
14.1 Section 13-801 Obligations are addressed in the attached Rider 1.
15.0 Entrance Facilities and Interconnection Facilities.
15.1 Dedicated Transport facilities that do not connect a pair of incumbent LEC wire centers, including but not
limited to, the transmission facilities that connect CLEC’s networks with SBC’s networks, are Entrance
Facilities that will no longer be Unbundled Network Elements provided pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(3)
under the Agreement. Effective immediately, CLEC shall not place orders for new Entrance Facilities as
UNEs. As to existing Entrance Facility UNEs, CLEC must within 90 days of the Effective Date of this
Attachment either request disconnection; submit a request for analogous access service; or identify and
request another alternative service arrangement.
15.2 Notwithstanding Section 15.1, SBC is required to provide access to facilities that CLEC requests to
interconnect with SBC’s network for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and
exchange access service, in accordance with the requirements of Section 251(c)(2) of the Act
("Interconnection Facilities").
15.3 Intentionally left blank.
15.4 For avoidance of doubt, CLEC may request that an Entrance Facility UNE be reclassified as an
Interconnection Facility pursuant to Section 15.1 if CLEC will use the facility for interconnection in
accordance with Section 15.2. SBC will perform such reclassification at no charge.

RIDER 1
Section 13-801 Obligations
1.1 Notwithstanding any determination of non-impairment that may affect SBC’s obligations under Section 251 of
the Act, CLEC may purchase the network elements (as defined in Section 13-216 of the Illinois Public Utilities
Act and referred to herein as “13-801 Elements”), and interconnection required by Section 13-801 of the
Illinois Public Utilities Act and applicable ICC orders interpreting Section 13-801 by providing such network
elements, combinations thereof and interconnection pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in
SBC’s intrastate tariff, ILL. C. C. No. 20, Part 19. Should SBC’s intrastate tariff for any or all 13-801 network
elements be canceled or withdrawn for any reason other than that SBC is no longer required by law to offer
such network elements under Section 13-801, the prices, terms and conditions for 13-801 network elements in
such tariff shall nonetheless be deemed to be incorporated into and to continue in effect as part of the
Agreement. The prices, terms and conditions to be incorporated shall be as they existed as of the date the
tariff was cancelled or withdrawn.
1.2 Intentionally left blank.
1.3 The recurring monthly rates for UNE-P in the above-referenced tariff shall be increased by $1. The recurring
monthly rates for DS1, DS3 and dark fiber loops and transport in the above-referenced tariffs that SBC is not
obligated to provide as unbundled network elements pursuant to Section 251(c) shall be increased by 15%.
1.4 If the Parties negotiate rates for Section 13-801 Elements other than those described in Sections 1.1 and 1.3,
such revised rates shall be effective on the date of the ICC order approving an amendment to the Agreement
adopting such revised rates. If the ICC issues an order in a proceeding of general applicability pursuant to
Section 13-801 (g) or other applicable provision of the Illinois Public Utilities Act resulting in rates for network
elements and/or interconnection provided by SBC in accordance with Section 13-801 that are different than
the rates described in Sections 1.1 and 1.3, such revised rates shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement on the later of the date of the ICC order or the date that revised tariffs resulting from the ICC order
become effective.
1.5 This Rider applies only to network elements that SBC is not required to offer as UNEs under Section 251 of
the Act.
1.6 Upon request, SBC will reclassify at no charge any Section 251 UNE or combination of UNEs to any Section
13-801 element or elements, provided such 13-801 element or elements are provided for in this Rider.
1.7 On February 25, 2005, SBC Illinois filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction in federal district
court for the Northern District of Illinois requesting that Court enjoin the Illinois Commerce Commission from
enforcing the provisions of Section 13-801 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act, as interpreted by the June 11,
2002 Order in Docket 01-0614, the Order itself and the implementing tariffs, insofar as they would require SBC
to provide unbundled access to local switching, related elements and UNE-P after March 11, 2005, on the
grounds that any such requirement is inconsistent with and preempted by the federal Telecommunications Act
of 1996 and the TRO. To the extent the Court enjoins enforcement of one or more of SBC’s obligations under
Section 13-801 to provide network elements or methods of interconnection, or if SBC’s obligation to provide
one or more network elements or methods of interconnection under Section 13-801 is otherwise discontinued,
enjoined or vacated by any court, the ICC, the FCC or the Legislature, the affected obligation shall
automatically terminate and SBC shall no longer be required to provide such Section 13-801 network
elements under the Agreement and this Amendment.

APPENDIX PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE means the AT&T ILECs as identified in the General Terms and
Conditions operating in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The performance
measurements and remedy plan referenced herein, notwithstanding any provisions in any other appendix in
this Agreement, are not intended to create, modify or otherwise affect Parties’ rights and obligations. The
existence of any particular performance measure, or the language describing that measure, is not evidence that
CLEC is entitled to any particular manner of access, nor is it evidence that AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-
STATE is limited to providing any particular manner of access. The Parties’ rights and obligations to such
access are defined elsewhere, including the relevant laws, FCC and state Commission decisions/regulations,
tariffs, and within this interconnection agreement.
1.2 Performance Measurements means the set of performance measurements approved by the specific State
Commission in the state-specific proceeding(s) listed in Section 1.8 below. The first set of measurements
effective under this agreement is that first submitted in the proceeding listed in Section 1.8 below after October
15, 2007. For purposes of implementation, such measures shall be effective as of December 1, 2007 for
performance beginning with December 2007 results.
1.3 AT&T Midwest Remedy Plan means the first remedy plan filed for State Commission review and approved in
the state-specific proceeding listed in Section 1.8 below on or after October 15, 2007. For purposes of
implementation, that remedy plan shall be effective as of December 1, 2007 for performance beginning with
December 2007 results.
1.4 Any subsequent Commission-approved additions, modifications and/or deletions to the Performance
Measurements, shall be automatically incorporated into this Agreement by reference in the first full month
following the effective date of the Commission’s order, or as otherwise agreed-to by the Parties.
1.5 Any future Commission-ordered additions, modifications and/or deletions to the AT&T Midwest Remedy Plan
(and its supporting documents) in the proceedings or under the Rule as listed in Section 1.8 below, or any
successor proceeding or Rule, to which no Party has objected, shall be automatically incorporated into this
Interconnection Agreement by reference in the first full month following the effective data of the Commission’s
order, or as otherwise agreed by the Parties.
1.6 AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE’s agreement to implement this Performance Measurements Plan will not
be considered as an admission against interest or an admission of liability in any legal, regulatory, or other
proceeding relating to the same performance. AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE and CLEC agree that
CLEC may not use the existence of this Plan as evidence that AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE has
discriminated in the provision of any facilities or services under Sections 251 or 252, or has violated any state
or federal law or regulation. AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE conduct underlying its performance
measures, and the performance data provided under the performance measures, however, are not made
inadmissible by these terms. Any CLEC accepting this performance measurements plan agrees that AT&T
MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE’s performance with respect to this plan may not be used as an admission of
liability or culpability for a violation of any state or federal law or regulation.
1.7 Nothing herein shall be interpreted to be a waiver of AT&T MIDWEST REGION 5-STATE’s right to argue and
contend in any forum, in the future, that sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 impose
no duty or legal obligation to negotiate and/or mediate or arbitrate a self-executing liquidated damages and
remedy plan.

AMENDMENT TO
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT
BY AND BETWEEN
ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY d/b/a AT&T ILLINOIS
AND
PEERLESS NETWORK OF ILLINOIS, LLC
Peerless Network of Illinois d/b/a AT&T Illinois1, as the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier in Illinois, (hereafter,
“ILEC”) and Peerless Network of Illinois, LLC as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) in Illinois, (referred to as
“CARRIER”), in order to amend, modify and supersede any affected provisions of their Interconnection Agreement with
ILEC in Illinois (“Interconnection Agreement”), hereby execute this Reciprocal Compensation Amendment for ISP-Bound
Traffic (“Amendment”). CLEC is also referred to as a “LEC”.
1.0 Scope of Amendment
1.1 ILEC made an offer to all telecommunications carriers in the State of Illinois (the “Offer”) to exchange traffic on
and after September 1, 2004 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating
compensation plan of the FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order, In the Matter of Implementation of the
Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Intercarrier Compensation for ISP-Bound
Traffic, FCC 01-131, CC Docket Nos. 96-98, 99-68 (rel. April 27, 2001) (“FCC ISP Compensation Order”) which
was remanded but not vacated in WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, No. 01-1218 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
1.2 The purpose of this Amendment is to include in CARRIER’s Interconnection Agreement the rates, terms and
conditions of the FCC’s interim ISP terminating compensation plan for the exchange of ISP-bound traffic lawfully
compensable under the FCC ISP Compensation Order (“ISP-bound Traffic”).
1.3 This Amendment is intended to supercede any and all contract sections, appendices, attachments, rate
schedules, or other portions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement that set forth rates, terms and
conditions for the terminating compensation for ISP-bound Traffic. Any inconsistencies between the provisions
of this Amendment and provisions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement shall be governed by the
provisions of this Amendment.
2.0 Rates, Terms and Conditions of FCC’s Interim ISP Terminating Compensation Plan
2.1 ILEC and CARRIER hereby agree that the following rates, terms and conditions shall apply to ISP-bound Traffic
exchanged between the Parties on and after the date this Amendment becomes effective pursuant to Section
4.1 of this Amendment.
2.2 Compensation Rate Schedule
2.2.1 The rates, terms, conditions in this section apply only to the termination of for ISP-bound Traffic, and ISP-
bound Traffic is subject to the rebuttable presumption in Section 2.3.
2.2.2 The Parties agree to compensate each other for the transport and termination for ISP-bound Traffic on a
minute of use basis, at $.0007 per minute of use.
2.3 ISP-bound Traffic Rebuttable Presumption
2.3.1 In accordance with Paragraph 79 of the FCC’s ISP Compensation Order, LEC and ILEC agree that there
is a rebuttable presumption that any of the combined Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and ISP-bound traffic
exchanged between LEC and ILEC exceeding a 3:1 terminating to originating ratio is presumed to be
ISP-bound Traffic subject to the compensation terms in this Section 2.0. Either Party has the right to

rebut the 3:1 ISP presumption by identifying the actual ISP-bound Traffic by any means mutually agreed
by the Parties, or by any method approved by the Commission. If a Party seeking to rebut the
presumption takes appropriate action at the Commission pursuant to Section 252 of the Act and the
Commission agrees that such Party has rebutted the presumption, the methodology and/or means
approved by the Commission for use in determining the ratio shall be utilized by the Parties as of the date
of the Commission approval and, in addition, shall be utilized to determine the appropriate true-up as
described below. During the pendency of any such proceedings to rebut the presumption, LEC and ILEC
will remain obligated to pay reciprocal compensation rates for Section 251(b)(5) Traffic and the rates set
forth in Section 2.2.2 for ISP-Bound Traffic. Such true-up shall be retroactive back to the date a Party
first sought appropriate relief from the Commission.
3.0 Reservation of Rights
3.1 The Parties reserve the right to raise the appropriate treatment of Voice Over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) and
traffic utilizing in whole or part Internet Protocol technology under the Dispute Resolution provisions of this
Agreement, including but not limited, to any rights they may have as a result of the FCC’s Order In the Matter of
Petition for Declaratory Ruling that AT&T’s Phone-to-Phone IP Telephony Services are Exempt from Access
Charges, WC Docket No. 02-361 (Rel. April 21, 2004). The Parties acknowledge that there is an on-going
disagreement between LECs and ILEC over whether or not, under the law, VoIP traffic or traffic utilizing in whole
or part IP technology is subject to reciprocal compensation or switched access charges. The Parties therefore
agree that neither one will argue or take the position before any regulatory commission or court that this
Amendment constitutes an agreement as to whether or not reciprocal compensation or switched access charges
apply to that traffic or a waiver by either Party of their position or their rights as to that issue. The Parties further
agree that they each have reserved the right to advocate their respective positions relating to the treatment and
compensation for VoIP traffic and traffic utilizing in whole or part Internet Protocol technology before any state
commission or the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) whether in bilateral complaint dockets,
arbitrations under Section 252 of the Act, state commission or FCC established rulemaking dockets, or before
any judicial or legislative body.
4.0 Miscellaneous
4.1 This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission and shall
become effective ten (10) days following approval by such Commission.
4.2 This Amendment is coterminous with the underlying Interconnection Agreement and does not extend the term or
change the termination provisions of the underlying Interconnection Agreement.
4.3 EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
4.4 Every rate, term and condition of this Amendment is legitimately related to the other rates, terms and conditions
in this Amendment. Without limiting the general applicability of the foregoing, the change of law provisions of
the underlying Interconnection Agreement, including but not limited to the “Intervening Law” or “Change of Law”
or “Regulatory Change” section of the General Terms and Conditions of the Interconnection Agreement and as
modified in this Amendment, are specifically agreed by the Parties to be legitimately related to, and inextricably
intertwined with this the other rates, terms and conditions of this Amendment.
4.5 In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies
or arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying
Agreement (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this
Amendment) with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which
the Parties have not yet fully incorporated into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.

bypass blocking systems.

Version: 11/18/15
1.0 Introduction
1.1 This Exhibit B sets forth the rates, terms and conditions for Transit Traffic Service when AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T
CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T NORTH CAROLINA,
AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS acts as a Transit Service Provider (“AT&T-TSP”) for CLEC.
Transit Traffic Service is provided to Telecommunications Carriers for Telecommunications Traffic that does not
originate with, or terminate to, AT&T-TSP’s End Users. Transit Traffic Service allows CLEC to exchange CLEC
originated traffic with a Third Party Terminating Carrier, to which CLEC is not directly interconnected, and it allows
CLEC to receive traffic originated by a Third Party Originating Carrier. AT&T-TSP offers Transit Traffic Services to
interconnected CLECs or to interconnected Out of Exchange Local Exchange Carriers.
2.0 Definitions
The following definitions are only for the purpose of Transit Traffic Service as set forth in this Exhibit B. If a definition
herein conflicts with any definition in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement or any other attachment or
appendix of the Agreement, then the definition herein governs for the sole purpose of this Exhibit B. To the extent
that defined terms in the Agreement are used in this Exhibit B, but for which no definition appears herein, then the
definition in the Agreement controls.
2.1 “AT&T Transit Service Provider” or “AT&T-TSP” means as applicable, AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T
INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA, and/or AT&T TEXAS as those entities provide Transit Traffic Services to CLEC and Third Parties.
2.2 “Local” means physically located in the same ILEC Local Exchange Area as defined by the ILEC Local (or “General”)
Exchange Tariff on file with the applicable state Commission or regulatory agency; or physically located within
neighboring ILEC Local Exchange Areas that are within the same common mandatory local calling area. This
includes but is not limited to, mandatory Extended Area Service (EAS), mandatory Extended Local Calling Service
(ELCS), or other types of mandatory expanded local calling scopes.
2.3 “Loss” or “Losses” means any and all losses, costs (including court costs), claims, damages (including fines,
penalties, or civil judgments and settlements), injuries, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
2.4 “Third Party Originating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier that originates Transit Traffic that transits
AT&T-TSP’s network and is delivered to CLEC.
2.5 “Third Party Terminating Carrier” means a Telecommunications Carrier to which traffic is terminated when CLEC
originates traffic that is sent through AT&T-TSP’s network using AT&T-TSP’s Transit Traffic Service.
2.6 “Transit Traffic” means traffic originating on CLEC’s network that is switched and transported by AT&T-TSP and
delivered to a Third Party Terminating Carrier’s network or traffic from a Third Party Originating Carrier’s network and
delivered to CLEC. A call that is originated or terminated by a CLEC purchasing local switching pursuant to a
commercial agreement with AT&T-TSP is not considered Transit Traffic for the purposes of this Exhibit. Additionally
Transit Traffic does not include traffic to/from IXCs.
2.7 “Transit Traffic MOUs” means all Transit Traffic minutes of use to be billed at the Transit Traffic rate by AT&T-TSP.
2.8 “Transit Traffic Service” is an optional switching and intermediate transport service provided by AT&T-TSP for Transit
Traffic between CLEC and a Third Party Originating or Terminating Carrier, where CLEC is directly interconnected
with an AT&T-TSP’s Tandem.
3.0 Responsibilities of the Parties
3.1 AT&T-TSP will provide CLEC with Transit Traffic Service to all Third Party Terminating Carriers with which AT&T-
TSP is interconnected, within the same LATA, or outside of that LATA to the extent a LATA boundary waiver exists.
3.2 Transit Traffic Service rates apply to all Transit Traffic that originates on CLEC’s network. Transit Traffic Service
rates are only applicable when calls do not originate with (or terminate to) an AT&T-TSP End User.
4.0 CLEC Originated Traffic
4.1 CLEC acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compensating Third Party Terminating Carriers for
Page 319 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Transit Traffic Service Exhibit B - ICA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 4 of 5
Page 19 of 53 Peerless Network
Version: 11/18/15
Transit Traffic that CLEC originates. AT&T-TSP will directly bill CLEC for CLEC-originated Transit Traffic. AT&T-
TSP will not act as a billing intermediary, i.e., clearinghouse, between CLEC and Third Party Terminating Carriers,
nor will AT&T-TSP pay any termination charges to the Third Party Terminating Carriers on behalf of CLEC.
4.2 If CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined to a Third Party Terminating Carrier with which CLEC does not have a
traffic compensation arrangement, then CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP against any and
all Losses, including, without limitation, charges levied by such Third Party Terminating Carrier against AT&T-TSP for
such Transit Traffic. Furthermore, if CLEC originates Transit Traffic destined for a Third Party Terminating Carrier
with which CLEC does not have a traffic compensation arrangement, and a regulatory agency or court orders AT&T-
TSP to pay such Third Party Terminating Carrier for the Transit Traffic AT&T-TSP has delivered to the Third Party
Terminating Carrier, then CLEC will indemnify AT&T-TSP for any and all Losses related to such regulatory agency or
court order, including, but not limited to, Transit Traffic termination charges, interest on such Transit Traffic
Termination charges, and any billing and collection costs that AT&T-TSP may incur to collect any of the foregoing
charges, interest or costs from CLEC.
4.3 CLEC shall be responsible for sending CPN and other appropriate information, as applicable, for calls delivered to
AT&T-TSP’s network. CLEC shall not strip, alter, modify, add, delete, change, or incorrectly assign or re-assign any
CPN. If AT&T-TSP identifies improper, incorrect, or fraudulent use of local exchange services, or identifies stripped,
altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN, then CLEC agrees to cooperate to
investigate and take corrective action. If CLEC is sending CPN to AT&T-TSP, but AT&T-TSP is not receiving proper
CPN information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP to correct the problem. If AT&T-TSP does not
receive CPN from CLEC, then AT&T-TSP cannot forward any CPN to the Third Party Terminating Carrier, and CLEC
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from any and all Losses arising from CLEC’s failure to include
CPN with Transit Traffic that AT&T-TSP delivers to a Third Party Terminating Carrier on behalf of CLEC.
4.4 CLEC, when acting as an originating carrier of Transit Traffic, has the sole responsibility for providing appropriate
information to identify Transit Traffic to Third Party Terminating Carriers.
5.0 CLEC Terminated Traffic
5.1 CLEC shall not charge AT&T-TSP when AT&T-TSP provides Transit Traffic Service for calls terminated to CLEC.
5.2 Where AT&T-TSP is providing Transit Traffic Service to CLEC, AT&T-TSP will pass the CPN received from the Third
Party Originating Carrier to CLEC. If AT&T-TSP does not receive CPN from the Third Party Originating Carrier, then
AT&T-TSP cannot forward CPN to CLEC; therefore, CLEC will indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T-TSP from
any and all Losses arising from or related to the lack of CPN in this situation. If AT&T-TSP or CLEC identifies
stripped, altered, modified, added, deleted, changed, and/or incorrectly assigned CPN from a Third Party Originating
Carrier, CLEC agrees to cooperate with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier to investigate and take
corrective action. If the Third Party Originating Carrier is sending CPN, but AT&T-TSP or CLEC is not properly
receiving the information, then CLEC will work cooperatively with AT&T-TSP and the Third Party Originating Carrier
to correct the problem.
5.3 CLEC agrees to seek terminating compensation for Transit Traffic directly from the Third Party Originating Carrier.
AT&T-TSP is not obligated to pay CLEC for such Transit Traffic, and AT&T-TSP is not to be deemed or considered
as the default originator of such Transit Traffic.
6.0 Transit Traffic Routing/Trunk Groups
6.1 When CLEC has one or more switches in a LATA and it desires to exchange Transit Traffic with Third Parties
through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall trunk to AT&T-TSP Tandems in such LATA pursuant to terms in the network
interconnection/network trunking attachment or appendix to this Agreement. In the event CLEC has no switch in a
LATA in which it desires to send Transit Traffic through AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish one or more POIs within
such LATA and trunk from each POI to AT&T-TSP’s Tandems in such LATA.
6.2 CLEC shall route Transit Traffic to the AT&T-TSP Tandem from which the Third Party Terminating Carrier switch
subtends.
6.3 Transit Traffic not routed to the appropriate AT&T-TSP Tandem by CLEC shall be considered misrouted. Transit

Transit Traffic Service Exhibit B - ICA/AT&T-21STATE
Page 5 of 5
Page 20 of 53 Peerless Network
Version: 11/18/15
Traffic routed by CLEC through AT&T-TSP’s End Office shall be considered misrouted. Upon written notification
from AT&T-TSP of misrouting of Transit Traffic, CLEC will correct such misrouting within sixty (60) days.
6.4 In AT&T ARKANSAS, AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OHIO, AT&T
OKLAHOMA, and/or AT&T TEXAS, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning, servicing, etc.) used to
route Section 251(b)(5) Traffic will be used by AT&T-TSP to route Transit Traffic.
6.5 In AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA, the same facilities and trunking (ordering, provisioning,
servicing, etc.) used for transit trunk groups will be utilized for the routing of Transit Traffic.
7.0 Direct Trunking Requirements.
7.1 When Transit Traffic originated by CLEC requires twenty-four (24) or more trunks, upon sixty (60) days written notice
from AT&T-TSP, CLEC shall establish a direct trunk group or alternate transit arrangement between itself and the
Third Party Terminating Carrier. Once a Trunk Group has been established, CLEC agrees to cease routing Transit
Traffic through the AT&T-TSP Tandem to the Third Party Terminating Carrier (described above), unless AT&T-TSP
and CLEC mutually agree otherwise.
8.0 Transit Traffic Rate Application
8.1 AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA, and/or, AT&T OHIO only,
8.1.1 The applicable Transit Traffic Service rate applies to all Transit Traffic MOUs. For AT&T CALIFORNIA,
AT&T INDIANA, and/or AT&T OHIO, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local and IntraLATA toll minutes of use.
CLEC agrees to compensate AT&T CALIFORNIA, AT&T INDIANA and/or AT&T OHIO as a transit service
provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.

AT&T TEXAS, Transit Traffic MOUs include Local minutes of use only. CLEC agrees to compensate AT&T
ARKANSAS, AT&T KANSAS, AT&T KENTUCKY, AT&T MISSOURI, AT&T OKLAHOMA, AT&T NORTH
CAROLINA and/or AT&T TEXAS as a Transit Service Provider for the rate elements at the rate set forth in
the Transit Traffic Service Pricing Schedule, Exhibit B.
8.3 AT&T MISSOURI only
8.3.1 Pursuant to the Missouri Public Service Commission Order in Case No. TO-99-483, the Transit Traffic rate
elements shall not apply to MCA Traffic (i.e., no transiting charges shall be assessed for MCA Traffic) for
AT&T MISSOURI.
8.4 AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA only
8.4.1 Traffic between CLEC and Wireless Type 1 Third Parties or Wireless Type 2A Third Parties that do not
engage in Meet Point Billing with AT&T KENTUCKY and/or AT&T NORTH CAROLINA shall not be treated
as Transit Traffic from a routing or billing perspective until such time as such traffic is identifiable as Transit
Traffic.
8.4.2 CLEC shall send all IntraLATA toll traffic to be terminated by an independent telephone company to the End

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which AT&T-21STATE shall provide Operator
Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
1.2 OS/DA:
1.2.1 This Attachment sets forth the rates, terms and conditions under which the Parties shall jointly carry out
OS/DA on a wholesale basis for CLEC End Users residing in AT&T-21STATE’s local Exchange territory,
regardless of whether CLEC is serving its End Users via:
1.2.1.1 CLEC’s own physical Switches; or
1.2.1.2 Resale of AT&T-21STATE Retail OS/DA service.
1.2.2 CLEC shall be the retail OS/DA provider to its End Users, and AT&T-21STATE shall be the wholesale
provider of OS/DA operations to CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall answer CLEC’s End User OS/DA calls on
CLEC’s behalf, as follows:
1.2.2.1 When the End User dials 0- or 0+ the telephone number, AT&T-21STATE shall provide the
Operator Services described in Section 3.4 below. CLEC may set its own retail OS/DA rates, and
CLEC therefore acknowledges its responsibility to obtain (a) End User agreement to the OS/DA
retail rates (e.g., by tariff or contract), and (b) any necessary regulatory approvals for its OS/DA
retail rates.
1.2.2.2 In response to CLEC End User inquiries about OS/DA rates, where available and technically
feasible, AT&T-21STATE operators shall quote CLEC retail OS/DA rates, provided by CLEC (see
Section 3.6 below). If further inquiries are made about rates, billing and/or other “business office”
questions, AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA operators shall direct the calling party’s inquiries to a CLEC-
provided contact number (also see Section 3.6 below).
1.2.3 CLEC shall pay the applicable OS/DA rates found in the Pricing Sheet based upon CLEC’s status as a
Facilities-Based CLEC or a reseller. Provided however, CLEC may serve both as a reseller and as a
facilities-based provider and CLEC may convert its facilities-based End Users to Resale service, or vice
versa, as described below in Section 3.6.7 below.
1.2.3.1 CLEC acknowledges and understands that wholesale OS/DA rates differ between Resale and
facilities-based service, and that both types of OS/DA wholesale rates are listed in the Pricing
Sheet.
1.2.3.2 Billing and payment details, including the assessment of late payment charges for unpaid
balances, are governed by the General Terms and Conditions in this Agreement.
1.3 Listings:
1.3.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions that apply to Resale and Facility-Based CLECs for
subscriber listing information provided by AT&T-21STATE.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
2.1 “Consolidated Reference Rater (CRR)” provides reference information (business office and repair numbers) and rate
quotes for CLEC End Users.
2.2 “Facilities-Based CLEC” means a CLEC that provides service through its own switch or a Third Party provider’s
switch.
2.3 “General Assistance” means a service in which the End User dialing - 0 asks the OS operator for assistance. The
operator will respond in accordance with OS methods and practices that are in effect at the time the End User makes
an OS call where available and technically feasible.
Page 324 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 24 of 53
2.4 “Listings” means information identifying the listed names of subscribers of carriers and subscribers’ telephone
numbers, addresses or primary advertising classification or any combination, and that carrier or affiliate has
published, caused to be published or accepted for publication in any directory format.
2.5 “Services” means Operator Services/Directory Assistance (OS/DA) and Listings.
2.6 “Toll Center Code” means the three digit access tandem code (“ATC”) that uniquely identifies a tandem switch in the
Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) designated as providing access to operator services functions.
3.0 OPERATOR SERVICES (OS) / DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (DA)
3.1 Dialing Parity:
3.1.1 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS/DA to CLEC’s End Users with no unreasonable dialing delays and at
dialing parity with AT&T-21STATE retail OS/DA services.
3.2 Response Parity:
3.2.1 Where available and technically feasible, CLEC’s End Users shall be answered by AT&T-21STATE’s OS
and DA platforms with the same priority and using the same methods as for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users.
3.2.2 Any technical difficulties in reaching the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA platform (e.g., cable cuts in the OS/DA
trunks, unusual OS/DA call volumes, etc.) will be experienced at parity with AT&T-21STATE End Users
served via that same AT&T-21STATE End Office Switch.
3.3 Requirements to Physically Interconnect:
3.3.1 This section describes the physical interconnection and trunking requirements for a Facilities-Based CLEC
to interconnect with AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switches.
3.3.2 The demarcation point for OS/DA traffic between the Parties’ networks need not coincide with the point of
interconnection for the physical interconnection of all other inter-carrier voice traffic, but at a minimum must
be in the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) in which the CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates.
3.3.2.1 Because CLEC’s switch may serve End Users in more than one LATA, the Parties agree that
CLEC’s OS/DA traffic originates from the physical location of the End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-
1212 and not the physical location of CLEC’s switch.
3.3.2.2 To the extent CLEC is serving via circuit-switched wireless technology, the physical location of the
End User dialing 0, 411, or 555-1212 shall be deemed the End User’s physical billing address,
regardless of whether the End User may be roaming at the time of placing the OS/DA call.
3.3.3 The Parties will establish an OS/DA demarcation point at the AT&T-21STATE’s OS/DA switch. By mutual
agreement, an alternative OS/DA demarcation point may be determined based on the following factors:
3.3.3.1 The size and type of facilities needed to carry CLEC’s switch-based OS/DA traffic;
3.3.3.2 Whether CLEC wishes to interconnect for OS or DA, or both;
3.3.3.3 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate is collocated in an AT&T-21STATE local tandem office and
wishes to use the collocation as the OS/DA demarcation point; and
3.3.3.4 Whether CLEC or CLEC’s Affiliate already has existing OS/DA facilities in place to the AT&T-
21STATE’s OS/DA platforms.
3.3.4 CLEC shall be financially responsible for the transport facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es). CLEC
may self-provision these OS/DA facilities, lease them from Third Parties, or lease them from AT&T-
21STATE’s intrastate Special Access Tariff. CLEC shall remain financially responsible for the transport
facilities to the AT&T-21STATE’s switch(es) and/or any one-way trunk groups from its designated operator
assistance and directory assistance (or OA/DA) switch to the AT&T-21STATE operator assistance switch
until CLEC initiates and successfully disconnects such transport facilities and/or trunk groups.
3.3.5 General OS/DA Trunking Requirements:
Page 325 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 25 of 53
3.3.5.1 CLEC will initiate an Access Service Request (ASR) for all OS/DA trunk groups from its switch to
the appropriate AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches as a segregated one-way trunk group utilizing
Multi-Frequency (MF) signaling. Unless technically infeasible, AT&T-21STATE will provision all
such one-way trunk groups in the same manner and at the same intervals as for all other
interconnection trunks between the Parties.
3.3.5.2 CLEC will employ Exchange Access Operator Services Signaling (EAOSS) from the AT&T-
21STATE End Offices to the AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches that are equipped to accept 10-Digit
Signaling for Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
3.3.5.3 Where EAOSS is not available, Modified Operator Services Signaling (MOSS) will be utilized, and
a segregated one-way trunk group with MF signaling will be established from CLEC to each AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switch for each served Numbering Plan Area (NPA) in the LATA.
3.3.6 Specific OS/DA Trunk Groups and Their Requirements
3.3.6.1 Operator Service Trunks:
3.3.6.1.1 CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to the AT&T-
21STATE OS switch serving OS End Users in that LATA. An OS only trunk group will
be designated with the appropriate OS traffic use code and modifier. If the trunk group
transports combined OS/DA/DACC over the same trunk group, then the group will be
designated with a different traffic use code and modifier for combined services. CLEC
will have administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk
group.
3.3.6.2 DA/DA Call Completion (DACC) Trunks:
3.3.6.2.1 Where permitted, CLEC shall establish a one-way trunk group from CLEC’s switch to
the AT&T-21STATE DA switch serving DA End Users in that LATA. If the trunk group
transports DA/DACC only, but not OS, then the trunk group will be designated with the
appropriate DA traffic use code and modifier.
3.3.6.2.2 In AT&T-12STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on a combined trunk
group, then the group will be designated with a different appropriate traffic use code
and modifier from that used for a DA/DACC only trunk group. CLEC will have
administrative control for the purpose of issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.3.6.2.3 In AT&T SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if OS/DA/DACC is transported together on
a combined trunk group, then the group will be designated with an appropriate traffic
use code and modifier. CLEC will have administrative control for the purpose of
issuing ASRs on this one-way trunk group.
3.4 Operator Services Call Processing and Rates:
3.4.1 AT&T-21STATE will assess its OS charges based upon whether the CLEC End User is receiving (a) manual
OS (i.e., provided via an operator), or (b) automated OS (i.e., an OS switch equipment voice recognition
feature, functioning either fully or partially without operators where available and technically feasible). The
Pricing Sheet contains the full set of OS recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.4.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide OS to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to AT&T-
21STATE End Users served in accordance with OS methods and practices in effect at the time the CLEC
End User makes an OS call.
3.5 Directory Assistance Call Processing and Rates:
3.5.1 AT&T-21STATE DA charges are assessed on a flat rate per call, regardless of call duration. The Pricing
Sheet contains the recurring and nonrecurring rates.
3.5.2 AT&T-21STATE will provide DA Services to CLEC End Users where available and technically feasible to
AT&T-21STATE End Users served in accordance with DA Services methods and practices that are in effect
Page 326 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 26 of 53
at the time CLEC End User makes a DA call. AT&T-21STATE will provide the following DA services to a
CLEC End User:
3.5.2.1 Local Directory Assistance - Consists of providing published name and telephone number.
3.5.2.2 Directory Assistance Call Completion (DACC) - A service in which a local or an intraLATA call to
the requested number is completed.
3.5.2.3 National Directory Assistance (NDA) - A service whereby callers may request published name and
telephone number outside their LATA or local calling area for any listed telephone number in the
United States.
3.5.2.4 Reverse Directory Assistance (RDA) - Consists of providing listed local and national name and
address information associated with a telephone number.
3.5.2.5 Business Category Search (BCS) - A service whereby callers may request business telephone
number listings for a specified category of business, when the name of the business is not known.
Telephone numbers may be requested for local and national businesses.
3.6 OS/DA Non-recurring Charges for Loading Automated Call Greeting (i.e., Brand Announcement), Rates and
Reference Information:
3.6.1 CLEC End Users will hear silence upon connecting with the OS/DA switch. As an alternative to silence,
CLEC may custom brand for which custom brand charges will apply.
3.6.1.1 CLEC will provide announcement phrase information, via Operator Services Translations
Questionnaire (OSTQ), to AT&T-21STATE in conformity with the format, length, and other
requirements specified for all CLECs on the AT&T CLEC Online website.
3.6.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will then perform all of the loading and testing of the announcement for each
applicable OS/DA switch prior to live traffic. CLEC may also change its pre-recorded
announcement at any time by providing a new announcement phrase in the same manner. CLEC
will be responsible for paying subsequent loading and testing charges.
3.6.1.3 CLEC understands that End Users may not perceive silent announcements as ordinary mechanical
handling of OS/DA calls.
3.6.1.4 CLEC agrees that if it does not brand the call, CLEC shall indemnify and hold AT&T-21STATE
harmless from any regulatory violation, consumer complaint, or other sanction for failing to identify
the OS/DA provider to the dialing End User.
3.6.2 AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC provided recording into all applicable OS and/or
DA switches prior to live traffic, testing the announcement for sound quality at parity with that provided to
AT&T-21STATE End Users. CLEC will be responsible for paying the initial recording announcement loading
charges, and thereafter, the per-call charge as well as any subsequent loading charges if new recordings or
silent announcements are provided as specified above.
3.6.3 Branding load charges are assessed per loaded recording, per OCN, per switch. For example, a CLEC
Reseller may choose to brand under a different name than its facilities-based operations, and therefore two
separate recordings could be loaded into each switch, each incurring the branding or silent load charge.
These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring, and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.4 Where Consolidated Reference Rater (“CRR”) is available and technically feasible, the applicable CLEC-
charged retail OS/DA rates and a CLEC-provided contact number (e.g., reference to a CLEC business office
or repair center) are loaded into the system utilized by the OS operator.
3.6.5 Where CRR is available and technically feasible, AT&T-21STATE will be responsible for loading the CLEC-
provided OS/DA retail rates and the CLEC provided contact number(s) into the OS/DA switches. CLEC will
be responsible for paying the initial reference and rate loading charges.
Page 327 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 27 of 53
3.6.6 CRR load charges are assessed per loaded set of rates/references, where CRR is available and technically
feasible, per OCN, per state. For example, a CLEC reseller may choose to rate differently than its Facilities-
Based CLEC operations, or may change its rates/references during the life of the contract, and therefore
separate sets of rates/references could be loaded for each OCN, per state, with each loading incurring the
rate/reference charge. These charges are mandatory, nonrecurring and are found in the Pricing Sheet.
3.6.7 Converting End Users from prior branded service to CLEC or silent-branded service, or between Resale and
facilities-based service:
3.6.7.1 To the extent that CLEC has already established the branding/silent announcement recording in
AT&T-21STATE OS/DA switches for both Resale and facilities-based service, then no non-
recurring charges apply to the conversion of End Users from prior Resale OS/DA wholesale
service to facilities-based OS/DA wholesale service, or vice versa.
3.6.7.2 To the extent that CLEC has not established the branding announcement recording in AT&T-
21STATE OS/DA switches for Resale and/or facilities-based service, then non-recurring charges
apply to set up the OS/DA call for the new type of service, as is described in Section 3.6 above,
and at the rates set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.0 LISTINGS
4.1 General Provisions:
4.1.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the provision of
listings, AT&T-21STATE will make available to CLEC, for CLEC End Users, non-discriminatory access to
listings, as described herein.
4.1.2 AT&T-21STATE will meet state requirements to make available listings through itself or a contracted vendor
to provide listings for its ILEC Territory, as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
4.2 Responsibilities of the Parties:

white page directories, AT&T-21STATE will include in appropriate white pages directories the primary
alphabetical listings of CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-21STATE ILEC Territory. When CLEC
provides its subscriber listing information to AT&T-21STATE listings database, CLEC will receive for its End
User, one primary listing in AT&T-21STATE white pages directory and a listing in AT&T-21STATE’s DA
database at no charge, other than applicable service order charges as set forth in the Pricing Sheet.
4.2.1.1 Except in the case of a Local Service Request (LSR) submitted solely to port a number from AT&T
SOUTHEAST REGION 9-STATE, if such listing is requested on the initial LSR associated with the
request for services, a single manual service order charge or electronic service order charge, as
appropriate, will apply to both the request for service and the request for the directory listing.
Where a subsequent LSR is placed solely to request a directory listing, or is placed to port a
number and request a directory listing, separate service order charges as set forth in AT&T-
21STATE’s tariffs shall apply, as well as the manual service order charge or the electronic service
order charge, as appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Listing Information Confidentiality:
4.2.1.2.1 AT&T-21STATE will afford CLEC’s directory listing information the same level of
confidentiality that AT&T-21STATE affords its own directory listing information.
4.2.1.3 Unlisted/Non-Published End Users:
4.2.1.3.1 CLEC will provide to AT&T-21STATE the names, addresses and telephone numbers
of all CLEC End Users who wish to be omitted from directories. Non-listed/Non-

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 28 of 53
4.2.1.4 Additional Listings:
4.2.1.4.1 Where a CLEC End User requires listings in addition to the primary listing to appear in
the white pages directory, AT&T-21STATE will offer such listings at rates as set forth
in AT&T-21STATE’s tariffs and/or service guidebooks. AT&T-21STATE does not
provide a resale discount for any listings. CLEC shall furnish to AT&T-21STATE
subscriber listing information pertaining to CLEC End Users located within the AT&T-
21STATE ILEC Territory, along with such additional information as AT&T-21STATE
may be required to include in the alphabetical listings of said directory. CLEC shall
refer to the AT&T CLEC Online website for methods, procedures and ordering
information.
4.2.2 CLEC will provide accurate subscriber listing information of its subscribers to AT&T-21STATE via a
mechanized feed of the directory listing information to AT&T-21STATE’s Directory Listing database. CLEC
agrees to submit all listing information via a mechanized process within six (6) months of the Effective Date
of this Agreement, or upon CLEC reaching a volume of two hundred (200) listing updates per day,
whichever comes first. CLEC’s subscriber listings will be interfiled (interspersed) in the directory among
AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. CLEC will submit listing information within one (1) business
day of installation, disconnection or other change in service (including change of non-listed or non-published
status) affecting the DA database or the directory listing of a CLEC End User. CLEC must submit all listing
information intended for publication by the directory close (a/k/a last listing activity) date.
4.2.3 Distribution of Directories:
4.2.3.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, each CLEC subscriber may receive one copy per primary End
User listing, as provided by CLEC, of the appropriate AT&T-21STATE white pages directory in the
same manner, format and at the same time that they are delivered to AT&T-21STATE’s
subscribers.
4.2.4 AT&T-21STATE shall direct its publishing vendor to offer CLEC the opportunity to include in the “Information
Pages”, or comparable section of its white pages directories (covering the territory where CLEC is certified
to provide local service), information provided by CLEC for CLEC installation, repair, customer service and
billing information.
4.2.5 Use of Subscriber Listing Information:
4.2.5.1 Subject to AT&T-21STATE’s practices, as well as the rules and regulations applicable to the
provision of white page directories, AT&T-21STATE agrees to serve as the single point of contact
for all independent and Third Party directory publishers who seek to include CLEC’s subscriber
(i.e., End User) listing information in an area directory, and to handle the CLEC’s subscriber listing
information in the same manner as AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber listing information. In exchange
for AT&T-21STATE serving as the single point of contact and handling all subscriber listing
information equally, CLEC authorizes AT&T-21STATE to include and use the CLEC subscriber
listing information provided to AT&T-21STATE DA databases, and to provide CLEC subscriber
listing information to directory publishers. Included in this authorization is release of CLEC listings
to requesting competing carriers as required by Section 271(c)(2)(B)(vii)(II) and Section 251(b)(3)
and any applicable state regulations and orders. Also included in this authorization is AT&T-
21STATE’s use of CLEC’s subscriber listing information in AT&T-21STATE’s DA, DA related
products and services, and directory publishing products and services.
4.2.5.2 AT&T-21STATE further agrees not to charge CLEC for serving as the single point of contact with
independent and Third Party directory publishers, no matter what number or type of requests are
fielded. In exchange for the handling of CLEC’s subscriber list information to directory publishers,
CLEC agrees that it will receive no compensation for AT&T-21STATE’s receipt of the subscriber
list information or for the subsequent release of this information to directory publishers. Such
CLEC subscriber list information shall be interfiled (interspersed) with AT&T-21STATE’s subscriber
Page 329 of 354

Contract Id: 4822368
Page 29 of 53
list information and the subscriber list information of other companies that have authorized a similar
release of their subscriber list information by AT&T-21STATE.
4.2.6 CLEC further agrees to pay all costs incurred by AT&T-21STATE and/or its Affiliates as a result of CLEC not
complying with the terms of this Attachment.

Affiliates and vendor as a result of such CLEC breach.

This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Agreement(s) by and between AT&T and CLEC as shown in the
attached Exhibit A.
WHEREAS, AT&T and CLEC are Parties to the Agreement(s) as shown in the attached Exhibit A,
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Agreement to implement the FCC Orders FCC-19-66 and FCC-19-72 in WC
Dkt. No. 18-141; Petition of USTelecom for Forbearance Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 160(c) to Accelerate Investment in
Broadband and Next-Generation Networks which was filed with the FCC on May 4, 2018 (“FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance
Order”); and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to
amend the Agreement as follows:
1. The Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals and the terms and conditions contained herein, all of which
are hereby incorporated by this reference and constitute a part of this Amendment.
2. As of February 2, 2020, except for resale services that are grandfathered pursuant to subsection a, CLEC may no
longer purchase any resale services pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any
resale Tariff referred to in this Agreement, other than the rates, terms and conditions provided for in Attachment
251(b)(1) Resale.
a. Resale services ordered on or before February 1, 2020 (“Resale Embedded Base”), are grandfathered until
August 2, 2022, and available only:
i. to the same End User; and
ii. at that same End User’s existing location;

Contract Id: 7513036
Amendment - FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance/AT&T-21STATE
Page 2 of 3
PEERLESS NETWORK
Version 09/27/19
iii. both as of February 2, 2020.
3. Add Attachment - 251(b)(1) Resale to the Agreement.
4. As of February 2, 2020, CLEC may no longer order 2-Wire Analog UNE Loops or 4-Wire Analog UNE Loops (“Analog
Loops”) pursuant to this Agreement. Any existing Analog Loops ordered on or before February 1, 2020 (“Analog
Loop Embedded Base”) are grandfathered until August 2, 2022. CLEC shall convert the Analog Loop Embedded
Base to a commercial offering, or other comparable service, or disconnect such Analog Loop on, or before, August 1,
2022. Exhibit B to this Amendment contains Analog Loop element descriptions and USOCs that are subject to the
FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance Order, however this Agreement may also contain additional and/or older element
descriptions and USOCs that are also Analog Loops subject to the FCC UNE and Resale Forbearance Order.
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining Analog Loops and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and non-
recurring charges:
i. convert to an analogous arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement executed by
the Parties, or
ii. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions
shall apply), or
iii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iv. disconnect.
b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between an Analog Loop rate and the non-UNE rate
that applies under this Section 4 for any new Analog Loops inadvertently ordered on or after February 2, 2020,
and any Analog Loop Embedded Base remaining as of August 1, 2022.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the Analog Loop shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the Analog Loop to an
analogous arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement or an AT&T tariff or guidebook
service.
5. As of January 12, 2020, CLEC may no longer order DS1/DS3 Unbundled Dedicated Transport (“DS1/DS3 UDT”),
whether stand-alone or part of a combination (e.g., Enhanced Extended Link), pursuant to this Agreement between
Tier 1 wire centers and/or wire centers subject to UDT forbearance under Public Notice DA 19-733, dated August 1,
2019. Any such existing DS1/DS3 UDT ordered on or before January 11, 2020, is grandfathered until July 12, 2022
(“UDT Embedded Base”).
i. CLEC must convert any grandfathered DS1/DS3 UDT to another product/service offering on or
before July 12, 2022, pursuant to the Conversion of 251(c)(3) UNE/UNE Combinations to
Wholesale Services provisions of this Agreement or other similar provision.
ii. If CLEC fails to convert grandfathered DS1/DS3 UDT before July 12, 2022, at AT&T’s sole
discretion, AT&T may convert any, or all, of the remaining DS1/DS3 UDT to the equivalent Special
Access service at month-to-month rates, terms and conditions. CLEC shall be responsible for all
associated recurring and non-recurring charges.
iii. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between a DS1/DS3 UDT rate and the
non-UNE rate that applies under this Section 5 for any new circuits inadvertently ordered on or
after January 12, 2020 and any UDT Embedded Base remaining as of July 12, 2022.
iv. If the FCC determines that additional wire centers are subject to forbearance, CLEC shall cease
ordering DS1/DS3 UDT as of the date specified by the FCC and adhere to any FCC-specified
transition timelines.
6. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying
Agreement (including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment)

Version 09/27/19
with respect to any orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not
yet fully incorporated into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
7. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall
be coterminous with such Agreement.
8. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
9. Signatures by all Parties to this Amendment are required to effectuate this Amendment. This Amendment may be
executed in counterparts. Each counterpart shall be considered an original and such counterpart shall together
constitute one and the same instrument.
10. For Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas: This Amendment shall be filed with and is
subject to approval by the applicable state Commission and shall become effective ten (10) days following approval
by such Commission. For Arkansas: This Amendment shall be filed with the Arkansas Public Service Commission
and shall become effective upon filing. For Ohio: Based on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Rules, the
Amendment is effective upon filing and is deemed approved by operation of law on the 91st day after filing. For

the Commission, upon thirty (30) days after the filing date of the Advice Letter to which this Amendment is appended.

the mailing date of the final order approving this Amendment.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Attachment sets forth terms and conditions for Section 251(b)(1) resale services (“Resale Services”) provided by
AT&T-21STATE to CLEC.
1.2 Pursuant to Section 251(b)(1), beginning February 2, 2020, CLEC may order and AT&T-21STATE shall make
available to CLEC for resale, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of this Attachment, Telecommunications
Services that AT&T-21STATE provides at retail to End Users who are not Telecommunications Carriers. Beginning
August 2, 2022, this Attachment shall govern all Resale Services CLEC purchases from AT&T-21STATE, including
Resale Services that were purchased prior to August 2, 2022 pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and/or
resale tariff and that remain in service as of that date (“Resale Embedded Base”).
2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 AT&T-21STATE’s obligation to provide Resale Services under this Attachment is subject to availability of existing
facilities. CLEC may resell Telecommunications Services provided hereunder only in those service areas in which
such Resale Services or any feature or capability thereof are currently offered to AT&T-21STATE’s End Users at
retail.
2.2 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or in any applicable Tariff, once a retail service has been
grandfathered it is available to CLEC for resale pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions of the state-specific retail
Tariff and only:
(i) to the same End User; and
(ii) at that same End User’s existing location;
(iii) both as of the time of that service’s grandfathering.
2.3 AT&T-21STATE may withdraw the availability of certain Telecommunication Services that AT&T-21STATE previously
provisioned to CLEC or retail End Users pursuant to C.F.R 51.325 through 51.335 as such rules may be amended
from time to time (the “Network Disclosure Rules”).
2.4 CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to avoid the rates, terms and conditions of AT&T-21STATE’s corresponding
retail Tariff(s). Moreover, CLEC shall not use any Resale Services to provide access or interconnection services to
itself, interexchange carriers (IXCs), wireless carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), interconnected VoIP
providers (IVPs), mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), or other Telecommunications providers; provided,
however, that CLEC may permit its End Users to use resold local exchange telephone service to access IXCs,
wireless carriers, CAPs, or other retail Telecommunications providers. CLEC may not resell any Resale Services to
another CLEC, including its own Affiliate(s).
2.5 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the state-specific retail Tariff(s) shall govern the rates, terms and
conditions associated with the Telecommunications Services available to CLEC for resale, except for any resale
restrictions; provided, however, that any restrictions on further resale by the End User shall continue to apply. CLEC
and its End Users may not use Resale Services in any manner not permitted for AT&T-21STATE’s End Users. Any
change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective
hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
2.6 CLEC shall only sell Plexar, Centrex and Centrex-like services to a single End User or multiple End User(s) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the retail Tariff(s) applicable to the state(s) in which service is
being offered.
2.7 Except where otherwise explicitly permitted in AT&T-21STATE’s Tariff(s), CLEC shall not permit the sharing of
Resale Services by multiple End User(s) or the aggregation of traffic from multiple End User(s) onto a single service.
2.8 CLEC shall only provide Resale Services under this Attachment to the same category of End User(s) to which AT&T-
21STATE offers such services (for example, residence service shall not be resold to business End Users).

Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
eligible for each such service. To the extent CLEC provides Resale Services that require certification on the part of
the End User, CLEC shall ensure that the End User meets all the Tariff eligibility requirements, has obtained proper
certification, continues to be eligible for the program(s), and complies with all rules and regulations as established by
the appropriate Commission and state Tariffs.
2.10 When ordering Resale Services that have an eligibility requirement (e.g., available only in a “retention”, “winback”, or
“competitive acquisition” setting), CLEC shall maintain (and provide to AT&T-21STATE upon reasonable request)
appropriate documentation, including, but not limited to, original End User service order data, evidencing the eligibility
of its End User(s) for such offering or promotion. AT&T-21STATE may request up to one (1) audit for each
promotion per twelve (12) month period that may cover up to the preceding twenty-four (24) month period.
2.11 Promotions of ninety (90) calendar days or less (“Short-Term Promotions”) shall not be available for resale.
Promotions lasting longer than ninety (90) calendar (“Long-Term Promotions”) may be made available for resale.
AT&T 21-STATE may eliminate any Resale Discount on all or certain Long-Term Promotions by providing a 45-day
notice of such elimination.
2.12 If CLEC is in violation of any provision of this Attachment, AT&T-21STATE will notify CLEC of the violation in writing
(“Resale Notice”). Such Resale Notice shall refer to the specific provision being violated. CLEC will have the breach
cure period as specified in the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement to correct the violation and notify
AT&T-21STATE in writing that the violation has been corrected. AT&T-21STATE will bill CLEC the greater of:
(i) the charges that would have been billed by AT&T-21STATE to CLEC or any Third Party but for the
stated violation; or
(ii) the actual amounts CLEC billed its End User(s) in connection with the stated violation.
2.13 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, CLEC acknowledges and agrees that the assumption or
resale to similarly-situated End Users of customer specific arrangement contracts, individual case basis contracts, or
any other customer specific pricing contract is not addressed in this Agreement and that if CLEC would like to resell
such arrangements, it may only do so consistent with applicable law and after negotiating an amendment hereto that
establishes the rates, terms and conditions thereof. Such amendment will only be effective upon written execution by
both Parties and approval by the Commission(s).
2.14 Except where otherwise required by law, CLEC shall not, without AT&T-21STATE’s prior written authorization, offer
the services covered by this Attachment using the trademarks, service marks, trade names, brand names, logos,
insignia, symbols or decorative designs of AT&T-21STATE or its Affiliates, nor shall CLEC state or imply that there is
any joint business association or similar arrangement with AT&T-21STATE in the provision of Telecommunications
Services to CLEC’s End Users.
3.0 PRICING AND DISCOUNTS
3.1 “Resale Discount” means the applicable discount off retail rates applied to AT&T-21STATE Telecommunications
Services resold by CLEC to its End Users. Any change to the rates, terms and conditions of any applicable retail
Tariff is automatically incorporated herein and is effective hereunder on the date any such change is effective.
3.2 The Resale Discounts in the underlying Interconnection Agreement will apply until AT&T-21STATE provides
notification of change to the Resale Discounts. AT&T-21STATE will provide such notification at least three (3) months
in advance of any change to current Resale Discounts. Changes to the Resale Discounts will be posted to AT&T
CLEC Online and will be incorporated by reference upon the effective date stated therein. For avoidance of doubt,
changes to Resale Discounts do not apply to Embedded Base Resale until August 2, 2022.
4.0 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES
4.1 CLEC shall be responsible for modifying and connecting any of its systems with AT&T-21STATE-provided interfaces,
as outlined in Attachment 07 – Operations Support Systems (OSS), and CLEC agrees to abide by AT&T-21STATE
procedures for ordering Resale Services. CLEC shall obtain End User authorization as required by applicable
federal and state laws and regulations and assumes responsibility for applicable charges as specified in Section
258(b) of the Act.

Page 5 of 6
PEERLESS NETWORK
Version: 3Q19 - CLEC ICA – 09/11/19
4.2 CLEC shall release End User accounts in accordance with the directions of its End Users or an End User’s
authorized agent. When a CLEC End User switches to another carrier, AT&T-21STATE may reclaim the End User or
process orders for another carrier, as applicable.
4.3 CLEC will have the ability to report trouble for its End Users to the appropriate AT&T-21STATE maintenance
center(s) as provided in the CLEC Online Handbook(s). CLEC End Users calling AT&T-21STATE will be referred to
CLEC at the telephone number(s) provided by CLEC to AT&T-21STATE. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to
authorize CLEC to repair, maintain, or in any way touch AT&T-21STATE’s network facilities, including without
limitation those facilities on End User premises.
4.4 CLEC’s End Users’ that activate Call Trace, or who are experiencing annoying calls, should contact law enforcement.
Law Enforcement works with the appropriate AT&T-21STATE operations centers responsible for handling such
requests. AT&T-21STATE shall notify CLEC of requests by its End Users to provide call records to the proper
authorities. Subsequent communication and resolution of each case involving one of CLEC’s End Users (whether
that End User is the victim or the suspect) will be coordinated through CLEC. AT&T-21STATE shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by CLEC and/or the End User against any claim, loss or damage arising from providing
this information to CLEC. It is the responsibility of CLEC to take the corrective action necessary with its End User
who makes annoying calls. Failure to do so will result in AT&T-21STATE taking corrective action, up to and including
disconnecting the End User’s service.
4.5 CLEC acknowledges that information AT&T-21STATE provides to law enforcement agencies at the agency’s
direction (e.g., Call Trace data) shall be limited to available billing number and address information. It shall be
CLEC’s responsibility to provide additional information necessary for any law enforcement agency’s investigation.
4.5.1 In addition to any other indemnity obligations in this Agreement, CLEC shall indemnify AT&T-21STATE
against any Claim that insufficient information led to inadequate prosecution.
4.5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall handle law enforcement requests in accordance with the Law Enforcement provisions
of the General Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
5.0 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF RATES AND CHARGES
5.1 CLEC is solely responsible for the payment of all charges for all services furnished under this Attachment, including
but not limited to calls originated or accepted at CLEC’s location and its End Users’ service locations.
5.1.1 Interexchange carrier traffic (e.g., sent-paid, information services and alternate operator services messages)
received by AT&T-21STATE for billing to Resale End User accounts will be returned as unbillable and will
not be passed to CLEC for billing. An unbillable code will be returned with those messages to the carrier
indicating that the messages were generated by a Resale account and will not be billed by AT&T-21STATE.
5.2 AT&T-21STATE shall not be responsible for how the associated charges for Resale Services may be allocated to
End Users or others by CLEC. Applicable rates and charges for services provided to CLEC under this Attachment
will be billed directly to CLEC and shall be the responsibility of CLEC.
5.2.1 Charges billed to CLEC for all services provided under this Attachment shall be paid by CLEC regardless of
CLEC’s ability or inability to collect from its End Users for such services.
5.2.2 If CLEC does not wish to be responsible for payment of charges for toll and information services (for
example, 900 calls), CLEC must order the appropriate available blocking for lines provided under this
Attachment and pay any applicable charges. It is CLEC’s responsibility to order the appropriate toll
restriction or blocking on lines resold to End Users. CLEC acknowledges that blocking is not available for
certain types of calls, including without limitation 800, 888, 411 and Directory Assistance Call Completion.
Depending on the origination point, for example, calls originating from correctional facilities, some calls may
bypass blocking systems. CLEC acknowledges all such limitations and accepts all responsibility for any
charges associated with calls for which blocking is not available and any charges associated with calls that
bypass blocking systems.
5.3 CLEC shall pay the Federal End User Common Line (EUCL) charge and any other appropriate FCC or Commission-
approved charges, as set forth in the appropriate Tariff(s), for each local exchange line furnished to CLEC under this

Contract Id: 7513036

Attachment.
5.4 To the extent allowable by law, CLEC shall be responsible for both Primary Interexchange Carrier (PIC) and Local
Primary IntraLATA Presubscription (LPIC) change charges associated with each local exchange line furnished to
CLEC under this Attachment. CLEC shall pay all charges for PIC and LPIC changes at the rates set forth in the
Pricing Schedule or, if any such rate is not listed in the Pricing Schedule, then as set forth in the applicable Tariff.
6.0 ANCILLARY SERVICES
6.1 E911 Emergency Service: The terms and conditions for the provision of AT&T-21STATE 911 services are contained
in Attachment 911/E911.
6.2 Payphone Services: CLEC may provide certain local Telecommunications Services to Payphone Service Providers
(PSPs) for PSPs’ use in providing payphone service. Rates for Payphone Services are established under the
provisions of Section 276 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and are not eligible for the Resale Discount
unless required by State Commission order(s). However, given certain billing system limitations, the Resale Discount
may be applied to Payphone Services, unless and until AT&T-21STATE is able to modify its billing system, AT&T-
21STATE may issue true-up bills in accordance with the provisions set forth in the General Terms and Conditions.
7.0 SUSPENSION OF SERVICE
7.1 See applicable Tariff(s) for rates, terms and conditions regarding Suspension of Service.
7.2 AT&T-21STATE will offer Suspension of Service to CLEC for CLEC initiated suspension of service of the CLEC’s
End Users. This service is not considered a Telecommunications Service and will receive no Resale Discount.

This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Agreements by and between AT&T and CLEC as shown in the attached
Exhibit B.
WHEREAS, AT&T and CLEC are Parties to the Agreements as shown in the attached Exhibit B, and
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Agreement to implement the FCC Order FCC-20-152 in WC Dkt. No. 19-308;
Modernizing Unbundling and Resale Requirements in an Era of Next-Generation Networks and Services which was filed with
the FCC on January 8, 2021 (“FCC UNE Relief Order”); and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to amend
the Agreement as follows:
1. The Amendment is composed of the foregoing recitals and the terms and conditions and exhibits contained herein, all of
which are hereby incorporated by this reference and constitute a part of this Amendment.
2. As of February 8, 2023, CLEC may no longer order new 2-Wire Digital UNE Loops (“Digital Loops”) pursuant to this
Agreement in Wire Centers where at least 50% of the census blocks served are designated as urbanized areas. Any
existing Digital Loops ordered on or before February 8, 2023 (“Digital Loop Embedded Base”) are grandfathered until
February 8, 2025. CLEC shall convert the Digital Loop Embedded Base to a commercial offering, or an alternate
arrangement, or disconnect such Digital Loop on or before February 8, 2025. Exhibit A to this Amendment contains Digital
Loop element descriptions and USOCs that are subject to the FCC UNE Relief Order; however, this Agreement may also
contain additional and/or older element descriptions and USOCs that are also Digital Loops subject to the FCC UNE Relief
Order.
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining Digital Loops and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and non-recurring
charges:

Contract Id: 2175014
Amendment – FCC UNE Forbearance (Additional Relief)/AT&T-21STATE
Page 2 of 4
PEERLESS NETWORK
Version 03/04/21
i. convert to a digital arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement executed by the Parties, or
ii. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions shall
apply), or
iii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iv. disconnect.
b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between the Digital Loop rate and the non-UNE rate that
applies under this Section 2 for any new Digital Loops inadvertently ordered on or after February 8, 2023, and any
Digital Loop Embedded Base remaining as of February 8, 2025.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the Digital Loop shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the Digital Loop to a Digital
arrangement available under a separate commercial agreement or an AT&T tariff or guidebook service.
3. As of February 8, 2023, CLEC may no longer order new DS1 UNE Loops (“DS1 Loops”) pursuant to this Agreement in
Wire Centers in counties deemed to be competitive in the BDS proceeding as listed in the AT&T Guidebook, which may
change from time to time. Any existing DS1 Loops ordered on or before February 8, 2023 (“DS1 Loop Embedded Base”)
are grandfathered until July 8, 2024. CLEC shall convert the DS1 Loop Embedded Base to an alternate arrangement, or
disconnect such DS1 Loop on or before July 8, 2024. Exhibit A to this Amendment contains DS1 Loop element descriptions
and USOCs that are subject to the FCC UNE Relief Order; however, this Agreement may also contain additional and/or
older element descriptions and USOCs that are also DS1 Loops subject to the FCC UNE Forbearance Order.
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining DS1 Loops and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and non-recurring
charges:
i. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions shall
apply), or
ii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iii. disconnect.
b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between the DS1 Loop rate and the non-UNE rate that
applies under this Section 3 for any new DS1 Loops inadvertently ordered on or after February 8, 2023, and any
DS1 Loop Embedded Base remaining as of July 8, 2024.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the DS1 Loop shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the DS1 Loop to a DS1
arrangement available under a separate AT&T tariff or guidebook service.
4. As of February 8, 2021, CLEC may no longer order new DS3 UNE Loops (“DS3 Loops”) pursuant to this Agreement in
Wire Centers in counties deemed to be competitive in the BDS proceeding as listed in the AT&T Guidebook, which may
change time to time. Any existing DS3 Loops ordered on or before February 8, 2021 (“DS3 Loop Embedded Base”) are
grandfathered until February 8, 2024. CLEC shall convert the DS3 Loop Embedded Base to an alternate arrangement or
disconnect such DS3 Loop on or before February 8, 2024. Exhibit A to this Amendment contains DS3 Loop element
descriptions and USOCs that are subject to the FCC UNE Relief Order, however this Agreement may also contain
additional and/or older element descriptions and USOCs that are also DS3 Loops subject to the FCC UNE Forbearance
Order.
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining DS3 Loops and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and non-recurring
charges:
i. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions shall
apply), or
ii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iii. disconnect.

b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between the DS3 Loop rate and the non-UNE rate that
applies under this Section 4 for any new DS1 Loops inadvertently ordered on or after February 8, 2021, and any
DS3 Loop Embedded Base remaining as of February 8, 2024.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the DS3 Loop shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the DS3 Loop to a DS3
arrangement available under a separate AT&T tariff or guidebook service.
5. As of February 8, 2021, CLEC may no longer order new UNE Dark Fiber Transport (“DFT”) pursuant to this Agreement
where the dark fiber transport is connected to a Tier 3 wire center located within ½ mile of competitive fiber as described
in the FCC UNE Relief Order and designated by the FCC. Any existing UNE Dark Fiber Transport facility ordered before
February 8, 2021 (“Dark Fiber Transport Embedded Base”) is grandfathered until February 8, 2029. CLEC shall convert
the UNE Dark Fiber Transport Embedded Base to an alternate arrangement, or disconnect such UNE Dark Fiber Transport
on or before February 8, 2029. Exhibit A to this Amendment contains UNE Dark Fiber Transport element descriptions and
USOCs that are subject to the FCC UNE Relief Order; however, this Agreement may also contain additional and/or older
element descriptions and USOCs that are also UNE Dark Fiber Transport subject to the FCC UNE Relief Order. If the
FCC determines that additional wire centers are subject to forbearance, CLEC shall cease ordering DFT as of the date
specified by the FCC and adhere to any FCC-specified transition timelines.
a. To the extent CLEC fails to adhere to the above, at AT&T’s sole discretion, AT&T may take one or more of the
following actions for any remaining UNE Dark Fiber Transport and CLEC will be responsible for all recurring and
non-recurring charges:
i. convert to AT&T tariff or guidebook services (in which case month-to-month rates, terms and conditions shall
apply), or
ii. reprice by application of a new rate (or by application of a surcharge to an existing rate), or
iii. disconnect.
b. AT&T reserves the right to backbill CLEC for the difference between an UNE Dark Fiber Transport rate and the non-
UNE rate that applies under this Section 5 for any new UNE Dark Fiber Transport inadvertently ordered on or after
February 8, 2021, and any UNE Dark Fiber Transport Embedded Base remaining as of February 8, 2029.
c. AT&T’s election to reprice the UNE Dark Fiber Transport shall not preclude AT&T from later converting the UNE
Dark Fiber Transport to a DFT arrangement available under a separate AT&T tariff or guidebook service.
6. As of February 8, 2021, CLEC may no longer order new UNE Subloops or UNE Network Interface Devices (NIDs) pursuant
to this Agreement.
7. CLEC shall provide a forecast of the total number of Unbundled Loops in its embedded customer base that it plans to
migrate to an alternate product or service. CLEC shall work with AT&T to establish mutually agreed to daily order volume
parameters and make a reasonable effort to affect a timely and orderly migration by the end of the transition period.
8. Intentionally Left Blank.
9. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying Agreement
(including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with respect to any
orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated
into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
10. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall be
coterminous with such Agreement.
11. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
12. Signatures by all Parties to this Amendment are required to effectuate this Amendment. This Amendment may be executed
in counterparts. Each counterpart shall be considered an original and such counterpart shall together constitute one and
the same instrument.
