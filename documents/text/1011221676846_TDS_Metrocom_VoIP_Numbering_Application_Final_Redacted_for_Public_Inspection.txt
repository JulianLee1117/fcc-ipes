Re: Request for Confidential Treatment, Application of TDS
Metrocom, LLC for Authority to Obtain Numbering
Resources Pursuant to Section 52.15(g) of the
Commission’s Rules
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to section 52.15(g) of the Commission’s rules, TDS Metrocom, LLC (“TDS
Metrocom”) hereby submits the enclosed application for authorization to obtain numbering
resources and requests confidential treatment of Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B contained therein.
Consistent with sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules,1 TDS Metrocom has labeled
the relevant exhibits “Confidential – Not for Public Inspection.”
TDS Metrocom respectfully requests confidential treatment for Exhibits A-2 and A-3,
which contain evidence of TDS Metrocom’s compliance with its 911 obligations under part 9 of
the Commission’s rules, as well as with the provisions of the Communications Assistance with
Law Enforcement Act, 47 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq (“CALEA”). These Exhibits contain commercially
sensitive agreements between TDS Metrocom and its 911 service provider, as well as
technologically sensitive diagrams showing how TDS Metrocom complies with CALEA.
Additionally, TDS Metrocom respectfully requests confidential treatment for Exhibit B,
which contains the interconnect agreement between TDS Metrocom and its Competitive Local
Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) partner. This Exhibit contains commercially sensitive pricing
information and proprietary technical information that TDS Metrocom does not make publicly
available in the normal course of business.
1 See 47 CFR §§ 0.457, 0.459.

TDS Metrocom therefore requests that the information in Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B be
withheld from public inspection pursuant to Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”) and section 0.457 of the Commission’s rules.2
In support of this request, TDS Metrocom provides the following information, as required
by sections 0.457(d)(2) and 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules.3
1. Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment
is sought.
TDS Metrocom requests that Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B be withheld from public
disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) and 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2). These Exhibits
contain proprietary and commercially sensitive information concerning TDS
Metrocom’s commercial agreement with its 911 service provider, technical diagrams
showing how TDS Metrocom complies with CALEA, and the pricing and terms of the
agreement between TDS Metrocom and its CLEC partner to serve as TDS Metrocom’s
homing tandem and to route local and access traffic (both originating and terminating)
to the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”).
2. Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information
was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving rise to the
submission.
TDS Metrocom is submitting Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B with its application for
numbering resources as proof that it complies with its 911 obligations under part 9 of
the Commission’s rules, as well as with the provisions of CALEA, pursuant to section
52.15(g)(3)(ii)(E) of the Commission’s rules, and as proof that it is capable of providing
service within sixty days of the numbering resources activation date, pursuant to
section 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(H) of the Commission’s rules.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or
financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged
Exhibits A-2 and A-3 contain business confidential agreements between TDS
Metrocom and its 911 service provider, and technical diagrams showing how TDS
Metrocom transmits voice traffic to the PSTN in compliance with CALEA. Exhibit B
contains the interconnect agreement between TDS Metrocom and its CLEC partner
with confidential pricing and technical terms. This information is subject to
exemption from public disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4.4 The Commission has
2 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); see also 47 CFR § 0.457(d)(2).
3 See 47 CFR §§ 0.457(d)(2), 0.459.
4 See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

long held that, for the purposes of Exemption 4, “records are ‘commercial’ as long as
the submitter has a commercial interest in them.”5
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that
is subject to competition
The interconnected voice over internet protocol (VoIP) market is highly competitive.
The commercial information at issue concerns TDS Metrocom’s ability to comply with
the 911 service and CALEA obligations applicable to all VoIP service providers, as well
as TDS Metrocom’s ability to provide VoIP service by interconnecting with the PSTN.
Thus, this information “concerns a service subject to competition.”6 As such, this
information qualifies as sensitive internal business and commercial information
entitled to protection under FOIA and the Commission’s rules.7
5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in
substantial competitive harm
Release of the confidential information contained in Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B likely
would cause competitive harm to TDS Metrocom. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit has stated, parties do not have to “‘show actual competitive harm’” to
justify confidential treatment; rather, “‘[a]ctual competition and the likelihood of
substantial competitive injury’ is sufficient to bring commercial information within the
realm of confidentiality.”8 The VoIP industry is highly competitive, and TDS
Metrocom’s competitors could take advantage of the commercially sensitive
agreements and technical information contained in the Exhibits.
6. Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent
unauthorized disclosure
TDS Metrocom treats the agreements and diagrams contained in Exhibits A-2, A-3,
and B as confidential and proprietary. It does not publicly disclose this information.

7. Identification of whether the information is available to the public and the
extent of any previous disclosure of the information to third parties
TDS Metrocom has not publicly disclosed the information for which it is seeking
protection. The information in Exhibits A-2 and A-3 is provided to TDS Metrocom’s
commercial partners subject to confidentiality provisions in the agreements to the
extent necessary for TDS Metrocom to comply with its 911 service and CALEA
obligations.
8. Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that
material should not be available for public disclosure
The confidential information contained in Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B should never be
released for public inspection. The information is commercially sensitive and
confidential and any release would commercially disadvantage TDS Metrocom.
For the foregoing reasons, TDS Metrocom respectfully requests that the Commission keep
Exhibits A-2, A-3, and B within the enclosed supplement confidential and withhold them from
public inspection.
Please direct any questions regarding this request to the undersigned.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ .
