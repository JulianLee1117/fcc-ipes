secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA").l Leap Telecom is voluntarily providing this information, "of a kind that would not customarily
be released to the public"; therefore, this information is "confidential" under FOIA2 . Moreover, Leap
Telecom would suffersubstantial competitive harm ifthis information were disclosed.3
