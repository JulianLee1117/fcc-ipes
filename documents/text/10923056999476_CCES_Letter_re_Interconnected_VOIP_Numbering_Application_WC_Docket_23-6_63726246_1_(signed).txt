Re: Interconnected VOIP Numbering Authorization
Direct Dial: +1 (202) 857-4527
Application filed by Consolidated Communications E-mail: Richard.Cameron@wbd-us.com
Enterprise Services, Inc., Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3) of
the Commission’s Rules, WC Docket No. 23-6
Dear Ms, Dortch:
On December 19, 2022, Consolidated Communications Enterprise Services, Inc.
(“CCES”), filed an application in the above-referenced docket seeking direct access to
numbering resources for provision of interconnected VOIP services (the “Application”). On July
7, 2023, CCES filed a supplement to that application (the “Supplement”) providing additional
detail concerning the “facilities readiness” requirements of Sections 52.15(g)(2) and
52.15(g)(3)((i)(D) of the Commission’s rules.1 At the request of the staff of the Wireline
Competition Bureau (the “Bureau”), through counsel, CCES now further supplements its
Application to clarify two additional matters.
First, CCES confirms that the certifications and other factual representations it provided
in the Application, as well as the further information it provided concerning facilities readiness
in the Supplement, apply to all states nationwide for which CCES seeks direct access to
numbering resources in this proceeding, including without limitation Maine, New Hampshire,
and Vermont. Those states were the explicit subject of a previous grant of authority for direct
access to numbering resources for Enhanced Communications of Northern New England, Inc.,
which merged into CCES, effective as of January 1, 2019.2
Second, CCES calls the Bureau’s attention to the International Bureau’s 2021 grant of a
Petition for Declaratory Ruling seeking authority for foreign investment in CCES’s controlling
US parent, Consolidated Communications, Inc. (“CCI”), to exceed the 25 percent benchmark for
foreign investment contained in Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended. This Declaratory Ruling permitted an investment in CCI’s parent, Consolidated
Communications Holdings, Inc. (“Consolidated”) through a group of funds affiliated with
1 47 C.F.R. §§ 52.15(g)(2), 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D).
2 See Application at 3; Public Notice, WC Docket No. 18-204, “Notice of Interconnected VoIP
Numbering Authorization Granted,” DA 18-1191, 33 FCC Rcd 11265 (Wir. Comp. Bur. 2018).

Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (“Searchlight”).3 The International Bureau authorized up to
100 percent aggregate foreign ownership of CCI, as the controlling U.S. parent of Commission
licensees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in section 1.5004 of the Commission’s
rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.5004.4 In addition, it granted advance approval for each of the identified
foreign entities to increase its indirect equity and/or voting interests in CCI up to a non-
controlling 49.99 percent.5
CCI’s parent, Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc., recently retabulated its
ownership data for its most recent Proxy Statement, which is incorporated herein by reference.6
Those recent data confirm that there have been no substantial changes in the Searchlight-affiliated
ownership percentages previously disclosed in connection with the Petition for Declaratory
Ruling7 and approved by the Commission. CCI’s foreign ownership today remains within the
limits of the authority previously granted by the Commission, with no substantive changes.
Very truly yours,
Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP
