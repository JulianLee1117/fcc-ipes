RE: Request for Confidential Treatment of Filing of Voyce Telecom LLC; Application
of Voyce Telecom LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources,
WC Docket No. 23-__
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules, Voyce Telecom LLC (“Voyce”),
hereby submits its application requesting authorization to obtain numbering resources.
This filing includes confidential information. As contemplated by the Commission’s rules, we
are filing the public version electronically and the confidential version via FedEx. Voyce respectfully
requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and
0.459, the Commission withhold from public inspection and grant confidential treatment to Exhibit A, a
document that contains sensitive trade secrets and commercial information that falls within Exemption 4
of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1 Voyce is voluntarily providing this information, “of a
kind that would customarily not be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential”
under FOIA.2 Moreover, Voyce would suffer substantial competitive harm if this information were
disclosed.3 As such, Exhibit A is marked with the header “SUBJECT TO REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT – NOT FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.”
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,4 Voyce
hereby states as follows:
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
2 Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
3 See Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR WHICH
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT IS SOUGHT.5
Voyce seeks confidential treatment of Exhibit A to the enclosed application.
2. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE SUBMISSION.6
As proof of Voyce’s facilities readiness as required by Section 52.15(b)(3)(i)(D) of the
Commission’s rules, Voyce is submitting its MSA and pertinent service orders between it and its
carrier partner as Exhibit A.
3. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION IS
COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL, OR CONTAINS A TRADE SECRET OR IS
PRIVILEGED.7
The information for which Voyce seeks confidential treatment contains sensitive commercial
information which would customarily be guarded from competitors.8 Exhibit A describes the
agreement between Voyce and its carrier partner and contains proprietary commercial
information concerning the operations and pricing of Voyce’s carrier partner and Voyce’s
network, services, and operating costs and expenses.
4. EXPLANATION OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INFORMATION CONCERNS
A SERVICE THAT IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION.9
Exhibit A contains information relating to commercial matters that could be used by competitors
to Voyce’s disadvantage. Voyce has numerous competitors in the Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services sector in which it operates. Detailed operations and commercial
information of the type provided by Voyce could compromise Voyce’s position in this highly
competitive industry. Release would therefore result in substantial competitive harm to Voyce.
5. EXPLANATION OF HOW DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION COULD
RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM.10
Competitors could use Voyce’s proprietary commercial and operational information to
Voyce’s detriment as they would gain access to sensitive information about how Voyce
provides services as well as about Voyce’s commercial agreements with others in the market that
are not normally disclosed to the public.

6. IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE SUBMITTING PARTY
TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE.11
Voyce has not distributed the information in Exhibit A to the public.
7. IDENTIFICATION OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE
PUBLIC AND THE EXTENT OF ANY PREVIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE
INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.12
Voyce has not previously disclosed the information in Exhibit A to the public or to third
parties.
8. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE SUBMITTING PARTY
ASSERTS THAT MATERIAL SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE.13
Voyce requests that Exhibit A be treated as confidential for a period of ten years. This period
is necessary due to the proprietary nature of the information in Exhibit A.
9. OTHER INFORMATION THAT VOYCE BELIEVES MAY BE USEFUL IN
ASSESSING WHETHER ITS REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD BE
GRANTED.14
The information concerns Voyce’s proprietary network information, related to current and
planned commercial and operational information, and, as such, is commercially sensitive.

PREFACE
This Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective as of October 11, 2007 (the “Effective
Date”), between Peerless Network of New York, LLC (“PN”), a Limited Liability Company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, with offices at 27 N. Wacker St., Suite 444,
Chicago, IL 60606 and Verizon New York Inc. (“Verizon”), a corporation organized under the
laws of the State of New York with offices at 140 West Street, New York, NY 10007 (Verizon and
PN may be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a “Party”, and, collectively, as the
“Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and PN hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and PN.

14. Term of Agreement, Regulatory Approvals and Filing
14.1 This Agreement shall commence when fully executed and approved by the
Commission or allowed to take effect by operation of law and have an initial term
of one (1) year from the date of that Commission approval. This Agreement shall
automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods, unless either Party gives

Agreement shall not renew. However, the Parties will continue to exchange traffic
to the mutual benefit of their respective End Users; provided, however, that
physical termination of the connection of the Parties' respective networks
established in this Agreement shall occur only in compliance with applicable rules
and regulations of the Commission. During the period prior to termination, the
Parties agree to cooperate with one another in ensuring that the exchange of Local
Traffic as provided for in this Agreement is not disrupted and to respond to any
Commission inquiry that may occur regarding the termination of this Agreement.
14.2 Each Party is responsible for obtaining and maintaining in effect all state regulatory
commission approvals and certifications that are required for that Party's provision
of local exchange and/or local exchange access services in the service areas covered

request renegotiation of a successor agreement by providing written notice thereof
to the other Party within sixty (60) days of receipt of the termination notice. Any
such request shall be deemed by both Parties to be a request for Interconnection
pursuant to Section 252 of the Act (or any successor provision), regardless of which
Party made such request.
14.5 If either Party requests renegotiation of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 14.4
above, the rates, terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the earlier of one hundred eighty (180) days from the expiration or
termination of this Agreement or the effective date of its successor agreement,
whether such successor agreement is established via negotiation, arbitration or
pursuant to Section 252(i) of the Act. Provided however, if the Parties by written
mutual agreement extend the negotiation period or if the Parties are actively
involved in arbitration of a successor agreement this Agreement shall continue in
effect until such negotiations or arbitration is completed and a successor agreement
is in effect.

33. Termination for Material Breach
33. l Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon sixty (60) days prior
written notice if (a) the other Party materially breaches this Agreement or defaults
on its obligations and fails to cure such breach or default during such sixty (60) day
period, (b) the other Party's authority to provide the services provided herein is
revoked or terminated, or (c) the other Party is insolvent, or files for bankruptcy (or
other protection from creditors generally) and such bankruptcy petition is not
dismissed within sixty (60) days. Te1mination of this Agreement for any cause shall
not release either Party from any liability which at the time of the te1mination had
already accrued to the other Pa1ty or which thereafter accrues in any respect for any
act or omission occurring prior to the termination relating to an obligation which is
expressly stated in this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties agree this Agreement shall be deemed effective upon
approval by the Commission or upon being permitted to go into effect by operation of law, and
each Party warrants that it has caused this Agreement to be signed and delivered by its duly
authorized representative.

AGREEMENT
PREFACE
This Agreement ("Agreement") shall be deemed effective as of August 8, 2011 (the "Effective
Date"), between Peerless Network of Virginia, LLC ("Peerless"), a limited liability company
organized under the laws of the State of Virginia, with offices at 222 S Riverside Plaza, Suite
2730, Chicago, IL 60606 and Verizon South Inc. ("Verizon"), a corporation organized under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia with offices at 201 N. Franklin Street, One Tampa City
Center, Tampa, FL 33602 (Verizon and Peerless may be referred to hereinafter, each,
individually as a "Party", and, collectively, as the "Parties").
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and Peerless hereby agree as follows:
The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection "(a)" shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties' prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim

the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and Peerless.

VERIZON FLORIDA LLC
FOR THE STATE OF
FLORIDA
Peerless FL Comp v3.3b

PPUUBBLLIICC VVEERRSSIIOONN
AGREEMENT
PREFACE
This Agreement (“Agreement”) shall be deemed effective as of August 9, 2010 (the “Effective
Date”), between Peerless Network of Florida, LLC (“PLN”), a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Florida, with offices at 222 S Riverside Plaza, Suite 2730, Chicago,
IL 60606 and Verizon Florida LLC (“Verizon”), a limited liability company organized under the
laws of the State of Florida with offices at 201 N. Franklin Street, One Tampa City Center,
Tampa, FL 33602 (Verizon and PLN may be referred to hereinafter, each, individually as a
“Party”, and, collectively, as the “Parties”).
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, pursuant to Section 252 of the Act, Verizon and PLN hereby agree as follows:
1. The Agreement
1.1 This Agreement includes: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs of each
Party applicable to the Services that are offered for sale by it in the Principal
Document (which Tariffs are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement
by reference); and, (c) an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party.
1.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Principal Document (including, but
not limited to, the Pricing Attachment), conflicts among provisions in the Principal
Document, Tariffs, and an Order by a Party that has been accepted by the other
Party, shall be resolved in accordance with the following order of precedence,
where the document identified in subsection “(a)” shall have the highest
precedence: (a) the Principal Document; (b) the Tariffs; and, (c) an Order by a
Party that has been accepted by the other Party. The fact that a provision
appears in the Principal Document but not in a Tariff, or in a Tariff but not in the
Principal Document, shall not be interpreted as, or deemed grounds for finding, a
conflict for the purposes of this Section 1.2.
1.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
agreement, understanding, or representation, on the subject matter hereof,
provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, this Agreement is an amendment, extension and restatement of the
Parties’ prior interconnection and resale agreement(s), if any, and, as such, this
Agreement is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed to create, a novation or
accord and satisfaction with respect to any prior interconnection or resale
agreements and, accordingly, all monetary obligations of the Parties to one
another under any prior interconnection or resale agreements shall remain in full
force and effect and shall constitute monetary obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement (provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall convert any claim or debt that would otherwise constitute a prepetition claim
or debt in a bankruptcy case into a postpetition claim or debt). In connection with
the foregoing, Verizon expressly reserves all of its rights under the Bankruptcy
Code and Applicable Law to seek or oppose any relief in respect of the
assumption, assumption and assignment, or rejection of any interconnection or
resale agreements between Verizon and PLN.

1.4 Except as otherwise provided in the Principal Document, the Principal Document
may not be waived or modified except by a written document that is signed by
the Parties. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, a Party shall have
the right to add, modify, or withdraw, its Tariff(s) at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the other Party.
2. Term and Termination

or terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, shall continue in effect

in this Agreement.
2.2 Either PLN or Verizon may terminate this Agreement effective upon the
expiration of the Initial Term or effective upon any date after expiration of the
Initial Term by providing written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days in
advance of the date of termination.
2.3 If either PLN or Verizon provides notice of termination pursuant to Section 2.2
and on or before the proposed date of termination either PLN or Verizon has
requested negotiation of a new interconnection agreement, unless this
Agreement is cancelled or terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof
(including, but not limited to, pursuant to Section 12), this Agreement shall
remain in effect until the earlier of: (a) the effective date of a new interconnection
agreement between PLN and Verizon; or, (b) the date one (1) year after the
proposed date of termination.
2.4 If either PLN or Verizon provides notice of termination pursuant to Section 2.2
and by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposed date of termination neither PLN
nor Verizon has requested negotiation of a new interconnection agreement, (a)
this Agreement will terminate at 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposed date of
termination, and (b) the Services being provided under this Agreement at the

8.3.2 If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, AT&T-22STATE is unable to contact CLEC pursuant to the
Notices provision hereof or any other contact information provided by CLEC under this Agreement, and there
are no active services being provisioned under this Agreement, then AT&T-22STATE may, at its discretion,
terminate this Agreement, without any liability whatsoever, upon sending of notification to CLEC pursuant to the
Notices section hereof.
8.4 Termination of Agreement after initial term expiration:
8.4.1 Where CLEC has no End Users or is no longer purchasing any services under this Agreement, CLEC may
terminate the Agreement by providing “Notice of Termination” to AT&T-22STATE at any time after the initial
term of this Agreement. After termination the Parties’ liability for termination of this Agreement shall be limited
to obligations under the Survival 40.1 below of this GTC.
8.4.2 Where CLEC has End Users and/or is purchasing Interconnection Services under this Agreement and either
Party seeks to terminate this Agreement, CLEC shall cooperate in good faith to effect an orderly transition of
service under this Agreement. CLEC shall be solely responsible (from a financial, operational and
administrative standpoint) to ensure that its End Users are transitioned to a new LEC prior to the expiration or
termination date of this Agreement.
8.4.3 If at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days or any time thereafter of the expiration of the Term, if
either Party serves “Notice of Expiration,” CLEC shall have ten (10) calendar days to provide AT&T-22STATE

to its written confirmation or Notice of Expiration, a written request to commence negotiations with AT&T-
22STATE under Sections 251/252 of the Act and identify each of the state(s) to which the successor
agreement will apply. Upon receipt of CLEC’s Section 252(a)(1) request, the Parties shall commence good
faith negotiations for a successor agreement.

Section 252(b)) or have filed for arbitration with the Commission upon expiration date of the Agreement AT&T-
22STATE shall continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement until a successor agreement becomes effective between the Parties. AT&T-22STATE’s obligation
to provide services under this Agreement beyond the expiration date conditions upon the Parties adherence to
the timeframes established within Section 252(b) of the Act. If CLEC does not adhere to said timeframes or
CLEC withdraws its arbitration or seeks an extension of time or continuance of such arbitration with AT&T-
22STATE’s consent, AT&T-22STATE may provide Notice to CLEC that all services provided thereafter shall be
pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s then current standard interconnection
agreement (“Generic”) as found on AT&T’s CLEC Online website.
8.4.5 Either on or following the expiration date of this Agreement, if the Parties have not entered into a new
agreement or are not in Active Negotiations as described in Section 8.4.4 above, then upon written Notice to
CLEC by AT&T-22STATE, AT&T-22STATE may continue to offer services to CLEC pursuant to the rates,
terms and conditions set forth in AT&T-22STATE’s then current Generic found at the AT&T CLEC Online
website. At any time thereafter, the Parties may initiate negotiations for a new agreement by providing a written
Notice under Section 252 to the other Party.

ported numbers, and ABT.
9.2 The Parties agree to cooperate with one another to investigate, minimize, and take corrective action in cases of fraud involving
1+ IntraLATA toll calls, ABT, and ported numbers. The Parties' fraud minimization procedures are to be cost-effective and
implemented so as not to unduly burden or harm one Party as compared to the other.
9.3 In cases of suspected fraudulent activity by an End User, at a minimum, the cooperation referenced in Section 9.1 above will
include providing to the other Party, upon request, information concerning End Users who terminate services to that Party
without paying all outstanding charges. The Party seeking such information is responsible for securing the End User's
permission to obtain such information.
