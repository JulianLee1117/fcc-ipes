Re: Application of Comcast IP Phone, LLC for Numbering Resources
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g) – Request for Confidential Treatment
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Comcast IP Phone, LLC (“Comcast”) hereby submits the attached confidential version of
its Application of Comcast IP Phone, LLC for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
(“Application”), the redacted version of which has been filed today via the non-docketed filing
module of the Electronic Comment Filing System of the Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC” or “Commission”). Pursuant to Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(“FOIA”) and the FCC’s rule,1 Comcast requests confidential treatment for the attached
unredacted Local Connect Service Trial Schedule (“Agreement”), which is being submitted with
the confidential version of the Application. The Agreement, which contains commercially
sensitive information, relates to Comcast’s provision of interconnected Voice over Internet
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457(d) and 0.459; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1905
(prohibiting disclosure “to any extent not authorized by law” of “information [that] concerns or
relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity,
confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of
any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association”).

Protocol (“VoIP”) services and includes company-specific, confidential commercial information,
including information that is protected from disclosure by FOIA Exemption 42 and the
Commission’s rules protecting information that is not routinely available for public inspection
and that would customarily be guarded from competitors.3
1. Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment is
sought. Comcast requests that the Agreement be treated as confidential pursuant to Exemption 4
of FOIA and Sections 0.457(d) and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, which protect confidential
commercial and other information not routinely available for public inspection. The Agreement
concerns the company’s provision of VoIP and includes both information about Comcast’s
operations and the costs of providing the service. This is company-specific, competitively-
sensitive, business confidential and/or proprietary commercial and financial information
concerning Comcast’s operations that would not routinely be made available to the public.
2. Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the information was
submitted or a description of the circumstance giving rise to the submission. Comcast is
submitting the Agreement in conjunction with the Application pursuant to the Commission’s
rules.
3. Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial or financial, or
contains a trade secret or is privileged. The Agreement contains company-specific,
competitively-sensitive, confidential and/or proprietary, commercial and financial information.4
This information can be used to determine information about Comcast’s operations and finances
that is sensitive for competitive and other reasons. This information would not customarily be
made available to the public and would be guarded from all.
4. Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a service that is
subject to competition. The confidential information at issue relates to the provision of VoIP,
which is subject to vigorous competition from other VoIP providers. If the information is not
protected, Comcast’s competitors will be able to use it to their competitive advantage.
2 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).
3 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457(d) and 0.459.
4 The Commission has broadly defined commercial information, stating that
“‘[c]ommercial’ is broader than information regarding basic commercial operations, such as
sales and profits; it includes information about work performed for the purpose of conducting a
business’s commercial operations.” Southern Company Request for Waiver of Section 90.629 of
the Commission’s Rules, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 1851, 1860 (1998)

5. Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in substantial
competitive harm. Since this type of information generally would not be subject to public
inspection and would customarily be guarded from competitors, the Commission’s rules
recognize that release of the information is likely to produce competitive harm.
6.-7. Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to prevent
unauthorized disclosure, and identification of whether the information is available to the public
and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information to third parties. The confidential
information in the Agreement is not available to the public and has not otherwise been disclosed
previously to the public. Comcast takes precautions to ensure that this type of information is not
released to the general public or obtained by its competitors and potential competitors through
other means.
8. Justification of the period during which the submitting party asserts that the
material should not be available for public disclosure. Comcast requests that the Agreement be
treated as confidential indefinitely, as it is not possible to determine at this time any date certain
by which the information could be disclosed without risk of harm.
9. Any other information that the party seeking confidential treatment believes may
be useful in assessing whether its request for confidentiality should be granted. Under
applicable Commission and federal court precedent, the information provided by Comcast on a
confidential basis should be shielded from public disclosure. Exemption 4 of FOIA shields
information that is: (1) commercial or financial in nature; (2) obtained from a person outside
government; and (3) privileged or confidential. The commercial and financial information in
question clearly satisfies this test.
Additionally, where disclosure is likely to impair the government’s ability to obtain
necessary information in the future, it is appropriate to grant confidential treatment to that
information.5 Failure to accord confidential treatment to this information is likely to dissuade
providers from voluntarily submitting such information in the future, thus depriving the FCC of
information necessary to evaluate facts and market conditions relevant to applications and policy
issues under its jurisdiction.
5 See National Parks and Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C. Cir.
1974); see also Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 878 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en
banc) (recognizing the importance of protecting information that “for whatever reason, ‘would
customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained’”) (citation
omitted).

3. Service Readiness (47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(D))
Comcast initially intends to provide service using numbers it obtains directly in Alabama,
Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and Maryland, although Comcast ultimately intends to provide such
service throughout its footprint. Comcast is capable of providing service within sixty days of the
numbering resources activation date. As proof of its facilities readiness, Comcast has attached to
this application (1) as Attachment A, a trial agreement between Comcast and its carrier partner
providing that the carrier partner will host Comcast numbers on its switches and provide PSTN
connectivity, which is the subject of a request for confidential treatment, and (2) as Attachment
B, interconnection agreements between Comcast’s carrier partner and a local exchange carrier.
4. Certifications (47 C.F.R. § 52.15(g)(3)(i)(E)-(G))
Comcast hereby certifies to the following:
a. Comcast complies with its Universal Service Fund contribution obligations under
47 C.F.R. part 54, subpart H; its Telecommunications Relay Service contribution obligations
under 47 C.F.R. § 64.604(c)(5)(iii); its NANP and LNP administration contribution obligations
under 47 C.F.R. §§ 52.17 and 52.32; its obligations to pay regulatory fees under 47 C.F.R.
§1.1154; and its 911 obligations under 47 C.F.R. part 9.
b. Comcast possesses the financial, managerial, and technical expertise to provide
reliable service. Indeed, Comcast has the superior technical qualifications necessary to provide
and maintain successful operations within its service area. For example, Comcast has the
capabilities to efficiently port and place numbers into service and successfully route calls. In
particular, the Comcast management team’s lengthy experience with number porting enables it,
along with its carrier partners, to create routing arrangements that seamlessly deliver calls to

numbers directly assigned to Comcast. Furthermore, Comcast’s personnel have extensive
business and network management experience in communications-related businesses and in
serving its targeted customer segments. These individuals lead a team that is highly qualified to
manage Comcast’s operations throughout its service area. The names of Comcast’s key
management and technical personnel follow:
Chief Network Officer: Jan Hofmeyr
Senior Vice President and General Manager Communications Services: Eric Schaefer
Senior Vice President, Operations: Lisa J. Panepinto
None of the identified personnel are being or have been investigated by the FCC or any law
enforcement or regulatory agency for failure to comply with any law, rule, or order.
c. Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.2001 and 1.2002, no party to the application is subject
to a denial of Federal benefits pursuant to section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.1

AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
NEUTRAL TANDEM-GEORGIA, LLC
BELLSOUTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS, LLC d/b/a AT&T GEORGIA
This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Interconnection Agreement by and between BellSouth
Telecommunications, LLC d/b/a AT&T Georgia (“AT&T Georgia”) and Neutral Tandem-Georgia, LLC (“Neutral Tandem” or

WHEREASS, AT&T Georgia and CLEC are parties to an Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and 252 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), approved July 10, 2009 and as subsequently amended (the
“Agreement”); and
WHEREASS, Neutral Tandem will be acting as a numbering partner for certain interconnected VoIP providers (“IVPs”) in
connection with the numbering trial approved by the FCC in the Direct Access Order, 28 FCC Rcd 5842 (2013). As such,
Neutral Tandem will be delivering traffic to and receiving traffic from AT&T on behalf of IVP for the duration of the trial.
NOWW, THEREFOREE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to
amend the Agreement as follows:
1. The Recitals are incorporated into this Amendment.
2. During the trial AT&T Georgia and Neutral Tandem will interconnect, exchange traffic and maintain compensation for IVP
traffic as if it were traffic to or from Neutral Tandem’ end users as provided for in the Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
after conclusion of the trial, Neutral Tandem and AT&T Georgia shall no longer exchange traffic destined to or originating
from IVPs, pursuant to this Agreement.
3. By agreeing to exchange IVP traffic pursuant to this Agreement for the duration of the trial, neither Party waives and each
Party expressly reserves its respective advocacy positions regarding the appropriate means of interconnection, traffic
exchange and intercarrier compensation for traffic exchanged between the Parties.
4. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
5. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying Agreement
(including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with respect to any
orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated
into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
6. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall be
coterminous with such Agreement.
7. This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval by the Georgia Public Service Commission (“Commission”)
and shall become effective one (1) day following filing with such Commission. If the Commission rejects this Amendment,
the Parties shall consult promptly to see if the Commission’s concerns can be resolved. If not, then this Amendment shall
be null and void and the rights and responsibilities of the parties with regard to IVP traffic shall be as set forth in their
current Interconnection Agreement. In such event, the Parties shall cooperate to minimize the possibility that any
required changes will disrupt service to consumers or other service providers.

BELLSOUTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS, LLC d/b/a AT&T FLORIDA
This Amendment (the “Amendment”) amends the Interconnection Agreement by and between BellSouth
Telecommunications, LLC d/b/a AT&T Florida (“AT&T Florida”) and Neutral Tandem-Florida, LLC (“Neutral Tandem” or
“CLEC”). AT&T Florida and CLEC are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party”.
WHEREASS, AT&T Florida and CLEC are parties to an Interconnection Agreement under Sections 251 and 252 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), approved July 21, 2009 and as subsequently amended (the
“Agreement”); and
WHEREASS, Neutral Tandem will be acting as a numbering partner for certain interconnected VoIP providers (“IVPs”) in
connection with the numbering trial approved by the FCC in the Direct Access Order, 28 FCC Rcd 5842 (2013). As such,
Neutral Tandem will be delivering traffic to and receiving traffic from AT&T on behalf of IVP for the duration of the trial.
NOWW, THEREFOREE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree to
amend the Agreement as follows:
1. The Recitals are incorporated into this Amendment.
2. During the trial AT&T Florida and Neutral Tandem will interconnect, exchange traffic and maintain compensation for IVP
traffic as if it were traffic to or from Neutral Tandem’ end users as provided for in the Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
after conclusion of the trial, Neutral Tandem and AT&T Florida shall no longer exchange traffic destined to or originating
from IVPs, pursuant to this Agreement.
3. By agreeing to exchange IVP traffic pursuant to this Agreement for the duration of the trial, neither Party waives and each
Party expressly reserves its respective advocacy positions regarding the appropriate means of interconnection, traffic
exchange and intercarrier compensation for traffic exchanged between the Parties.
4. EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT
SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
5. In entering into this Amendment, neither Party waives, and each Party expressly reserves, any rights, remedies or
arguments it may have at law or under the intervening law or regulatory change provisions in the underlying Agreement
(including intervening law rights asserted by either Party via written notice predating this Amendment) with respect to any
orders, decisions, legislation or proceedings and any remands thereof, which the Parties have not yet fully incorporated
into this Agreement or which may be the subject of further review.
6. This Amendment shall not modify or extend the Effective Date or Term of the underlying Agreement, but rather, shall be
coterminous with such Agreement.
7. This Amendment shall be filed with and is subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission (“Commission”)
and shall become effective one (1) day following filing with such Commission. If the Commission rejects this Amendment,
the Parties shall consult promptly to see if the Commission’s concerns can be resolved. If not, then this Amendment shall
be null and void and the rights and responsibilities of the parties with regard to IVP traffic shall be as set forth in their
current Interconnection Agreement. In such event, the Parties shall cooperate to minimize the possibility that any
required changes will disrupt service to consumers or other service providers.

2.1 The initial term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years, beginning on the Effective Date and shall

North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Notwithstanding any prior agreement of the
Parties, the rates, terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be applied retroactively prior to
the Effective Date.
2.2 The Parties agree that by no earlier than two hundred seventy (270) days and no later than one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the initial term of this Agreement, the Parties
shall commence negotiations for a new agreement to be effective beginning on the expiration date
of this Agreement (Subsequent Agreement). If as of the expiration of the initial term of this
Agreement, a Subsequent Agreement has not been executed by the Parties, then except as set
forth in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 below, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis
while a Subsequent Agreement is being negotiated. The Parties’ rights and obligations with respect
to this Agreement after expiration of the initial term shall be as set forth in Section 2.3 below.
2.3 If, within one hundred thirty-five (135) days of commencing the negotiation referred to in Section 2.2

Tandem. In the event that AT&T terminates this Agreement as provided above, AT&T shall

AT&T’s then current standard interconnection agreement. In the event that AT&T’s standard
interconnection agreement becomes effective between the Parties, the Parties may continue to
negotiate a Subsequent Agreement.
2.3.2 Notwithstanding Section 2.2 above, in the event that as of the expiration of the initial term of this
Agreement the Parties have not entered into a Subsequent Agreement and no arbitration
proceeding has been filed in accordance with Section 2.3 above and AT&T is not providing any

the expiration date hereof.
2.4 If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, AT&T is unable to contact Neutral Tandem
pursuant to the Notices provision hereof or any other contact information provided by Neutral
Tandem under this Agreement, and there are no active services being provisioned under this
Agreement, then AT&T may, at its discretion, terminate this Agreement, without any liability
whatsoever, upon sending of notification to Neutral Tandem pursuant to the Notices section hereof.
Furthermore, if after eighteen (18) months following the Effective Date of this Agreement Neutral

without any liability to AT&T, upon notification to Neutral Tandem pursuant to the Notices section
hereof.
2.5 In addition to as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, AT&T reserves the right to suspend access
to ordering systems, refuse to process additional or pending applications for service, or terminate
service in the event of prohibited, unlawful or improper use of AT&T’s facilities or service, abuse of
AT&T’s facilities or any other material breach of this Agreement, and all monies owed on all
outstanding invoices shall become due. In such event, Neutral Tandem is solely responsible for
notifying its customers of any discontinuance of service.
3 Nondiscriminator Access
When Neutral Tandem purchases Telecommunications Services from AT&T pursuant to
Attachment 1 of this Agreement for the purposes of resale to customers, such services shall be
equal in quality, subject to the same conditions, and provided within the same provisioning time
intervals that AT&T provides to others, including its customers. To the extent technically feasible,
the quality of a Network Element, as well as the quality of the access to such Network Element
provided by AT&T to Neutral Tandem shall be at least equal to that which AT&T provides to itself
and shall be the same for all Telecommunications carriers requesting access to that Network
Element. The quality of the interconnection between the network of AT&T and the network of
Neutral Tandem shall be at a level that is equal to that which AT&T provides itself, a subsidiary, an
Affiliate, or any other party. The interconnection facilities shall be designed to meet the same
technical criteria and service standards that are used within AT&T’s network and shall extend to a
consideration of service quality as perceived by AT&T’s customers and service quality as perceived
by Neutral Tandem.
4 Court Ordered Requests for Call Detail Records and Other Subscriber Information
4.1 Subpoenas Directed to AT&T. Where AT&T provides resold services for Neutral Tandem, AT&T
shall respond to subpoenas and court ordered requests delivered directly to AT&T for the purpose
of providing call detail records when the targeted telephone numbers belong to Neutral Tandem
customers. Billing for such requests will be generated by AT&T and directed to the law
enforcement agency initiating the request. AT&T shall maintain such information for Neutral
Tandem customers for the same length of time it maintains such information for its own customers.
4.2 Subpoenas Directed to Neutral Tandem. Where AT&T is providing resold services to Neutral
Tandem, then Neutral Tandem agrees that in those cases where Neutral Tandem receives
subpoenas or court ordered requests regarding targeted telephone numbers belonging to Neutral
Tandem customers, and where Neutral Tandem does not have the requested information, Neutral
Tandem will advise the law enforcement agency initiating the request to redirect the subpoena or
court ordered request to AT&T for handling in accordance with Section 4.1 above.
4.3 In all other instances, where either Party receives a request for information involving the other
Party’s customer, the Party receiving the request will advise the law enforcement agency initiating
the request to redirect such request to the other Party.

5 Liabilit and Indemnification
5.1 Neutral Tandem Liability. In the event that Neutral Tandem consists of two (2) or more separate

shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of Neutral Tandem under this Agreement.
5.2 Liability for Acts or Omissions of Third Parties. AT&T shall not be liable to Neutral Tandem for any

or arising out of any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict
liability or otherwise, relating to the performance of this Agreement, shall not exceed a credit for the
actual cost of the services or functions not performed or improperly performed. Any amounts paid
to Neutral Tandem pursuant to Attachment 9 hereof shall be credited against any damages
otherwise payable to Neutral Tandem pursuant to this Agreement.
5.3.1 Limitations in Tariffs. A Party may, in its sole discretion, provide in its tariffs and contracts with its

under this Agreement, that to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Party shall
not be liable to the customer or third party for (i) any loss relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, that exceeds the amount such Party would have charged that
applicable person for the service, product or function that gave rise to such loss and (ii)
consequential damages. To the extent that a Party elects not to place in its tariffs or contracts such
limitations of liability, and the other Party incurs a loss as a result thereof, such Party shall, except
to the extent caused by the other Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, indemnify and
reimburse the other Party for that portion of the loss that would have been limited had the first Party
included in its tariffs and contracts the limitations of liability that such other Party included in its own
tariffs at the time of such loss.
5.3.2 Neither AT&T nor Neutral Tandem shall be liable for damages to the other Party’s terminal location,
equipment or customer premises resulting from the furnishing of a service, including, but not limited
to, the installation and removal of equipment or associated wiring, except to the extent caused by a

with this limitation of liability, each Party recognizes that the other Party may, from time to time,
provide advice, make recommendations, or supply other analyses related to the services or
facilities described in this Agreement, and, while each Party shall use diligent efforts in this regard,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that this limitation of liability shall apply to provision of such
advice, recommendations, and analyses.

6 Intellectual Propert Rights and Indemnification
6.1 No License. Except as expressly set forth in Section 6.2 below, no patent, copyright, trademark or
other proprietary right is licensed, granted or otherwise transferred by this Agreement. The Parties
are strictly prohibited from any use, including but not limited to, in the selling, marketing, promoting
or advertising of telecommunications services, of any name, service mark, logo or trademark
(collectively, the “Marks”) of the other Party. The Marks include those Marks owned directly by a
Party or its Affiliate(s) and those Marks that a Party has a legal and valid license to use. The Parties
acknowledge that they are separate and distinct and that each provides a separate and distinct
service and agree that neither Party may, expressly or impliedly, state, advertise or market that it is
or offers the same service as the other Party or engage in any other activity that may result in a
likelihood of confusion between its own service and the service of the other Party.
6.2 Ownership of Intellectual Property. Any intellectual property that originates from or is developed by
a Party shall remain the exclusive property of that Party. Except for a limited, non-assignable, non-
exclusive, non-transferable license to use patents or copyrights to the extent necessary for the
Parties to use any facilities or equipment (including software) or to receive any service solely as
provided under this Agreement, no license in patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, or other
proprietary or intellectual property right, now or hereafter owned, controlled or licensable by a
Party, is granted to the other Party. Neither shall it be implied nor arise by estoppel. Any

under this Agreement.
6.3 Intellectual Property Remedies
6.3.1 Indemnification. The Party providing a service pursuant to this Agreement will defend the Party
receiving such service or data provided as a result of such service against claims of infringement

this Agreement and will indemnify the receiving Party for any damages awarded based solely on
such claims in accordance with Section 5 above.
6.3.2 Claim of Infringement
6.3.2.1 In the event that use of any facilities or equipment (including software), becomes, or in the
reasonable judgment of the Party who owns the affected network is likely to become, the subject of
a claim, action, suit, or proceeding based on intellectual property infringement, then said Party,
promptly and at its sole expense and sole option, but subject to the limitations of liability set forth
below, shall:
6.3.2.2 modify or replace the applicable facilities or equipment (including software) while maintaining form
and function, or
6.3.2.3 obtain a license sufficient to allow such use to continue.

use of, the affected facilities or equipment (including software), but solely to the extent required to
avoid the infringement claim.
6.3.3 Exception to Obligations. Neither Party's obligations under this Section shall apply to the extent the
infringement is caused by: (i) modification of the facilities or equipment (including software) by the
indemnitee; (ii) use by the indemnitee of the facilities or equipment (including software) in
combination with equipment or facilities (including software) not provided or authorized by the
indemnitor, provided the facilities or equipment (including software) would not be infringing if used
alone; (iii) conformance to specifications of the indemnitee which would necessarily result in
infringement; or (iv) continued use by the indemnitee of the affected facilities or equipment
(including software) after being placed on notice to discontinue use as set forth herein.

obligations with respect to a third party claim of intellectual property infringement arising out of the

payments, contractual or otherwise, for the use of public streets or rights of way, whether
designated as franchise fees or otherwise) imposed, or sought to be imposed, on or with respect to
the services furnished hereunder or measured by the charges or payments therefor, excluding any

9.3.3 If the purchasing Party determines that in its opinion any such taxes or fees are not applicable, the
providing Party shall not bill such taxes or fees to the purchasing Party if the purchasing Party

or otherwise not subject to the tax or fee, setting forth the basis therefor, and satisfying any other
requirements under applicable law. If any authority seeks to collect any such tax or fee that the
purchasing Party has determined and certified not to be applicable, or any such tax or fee that was
not billed by the providing Party, the purchasing Party may contest the same in good faith, at its
own expense. In any such contest, the purchasing Party shall promptly furnish the providing Party

contest the imposition of any such tax or fee, or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of the
providing Party during the pendency of such contest, the purchasing Party shall be responsible for
such payment and shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery. The purchasing Party
shall have the right to contest, at its own expense, any such tax or fee that it believes is not

assignment is not permitted, by filing and pursuing a claim for refund on behalf of the purchasing
Party but at the purchasing Party’s expense.

authority, the purchasing Party shall pay such additional amount, including any interest and
penalties thereon.

hold harmless (and defend at the purchasing Party’s expense) the providing Party from and against

connection with any claim for or contest of any such tax or fee.
9.3.7 Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing of any assessment, proposed assessment or other
claim for any additional amount of such a tax or fee by a taxing authority; provided, however, that

9.4.1 Taxes and fees imposed on the providing Party, which are permitted or required to be passed on
by the providing Party to its customer, shall be borne by the purchasing Party.

billingdocuments between the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the purchasing Party shall
remain liable for any such taxes and fees regardless of whether they are actually billed by the
providing Party at the time that the respective service is billed.
9.4.3 If the purchasing Party disagrees with the providing Party’s determination as to the application of or
basis for any such tax or fee, the Parties shall consult with respect to the imposition and billing of

the purchasing Party shall abide by such determination and pay such taxes or fees to the providing
Party. The providing Party shall further retain ultimate responsibility for determining whether and
how to contest the imposition of such taxes and fees; provided, however, that any such contest
undertaken at the request of the purchasing Party shall be at the purchasing Party’s expense.
9.4.4 In the event that all or any portion of an amount sought to be collected must be paid in order to
contest the imposition of any such tax or fee, or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of the
providing Party during the pendency of such contest, the purchasing Party shall be responsible for
such payment and shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery. The purchasing Party
shall have the right to contest, at its own expense, any such tax or fee that it believes is not
applicable or was paid by it in error. If requested in writing by the purchasing Party, the providing
Party shall facilitate such contest either by assigning to the purchasing Party its right to claim a
refund of such tax or fee, if such an assignment is permitted under applicable law, or, if an
assignment is not permitted, by filing and pursuing a claim for refund on behalf of the purchasing
Party but at the purchasing Party’s expense.
9.4.5 If it is ultimately determined that any additional amount of such a tax or fee is due to the imposing
authority, the purchasing Party shall pay such additional amount, including any interest and
penalties thereon.
9.4.6 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the purchasing Party shall protect, indemnify and
hold harmless (and defend at the purchasing Party’s expense) the providing Party from and against
any such tax or fee, interest or penalties thereon, or other charges or payable expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) with respect thereto, which are incurred by the providing Party in
connection with any claim for or contest of any such tax or fee.
9.4.7 Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing of any assessment, proposed assessment or other
claim for any additional amount of such a tax or fee by a taxing authority; provided, however, that
the failure of a Party to provide notice shall not relieve the other Party of any obligations hereunder.
9.5 Additional Provisions Applicable to All Taxes and Fees
9.5.1 In any contest of a tax or fee by one Party, the other Party shall cooperate fully by providing
records, testimony and such additional information or assistance as may reasonably be necessary
to pursue the contest. Further, the other Party shall be reimbursed for any reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket copying and travel expenses incurred in assisting in such contest.
9.5.2 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any administrative, judicial, or
other proceeding concerning the application or amount of a tax or fee shall be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of this Section and any applicable federal, state or local law
governing the resolution of such disputed tax or fee; and under no circumstances shall either Party
have the right to bring a dispute related to the application or amount of a tax or fee before a
regulatory authority.
10 Force Majeure
In the event performance of this Agreement, or any obligation hereunder, is either directly or
indirectly prevented, restricted, or interfered with by reason of fire, flood, earthquake or like acts of

slowdowns, picketing, or boycotts, unavailability of equipment from vendor, changes requested by
Neutral Tandem, or any other circumstances beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or
negligence of the Party affected, the Party affected shall be excused from such performance on a
day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and the other Party
shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis until the delay,
restriction or interference has ceased); provided, however, that the Party so affected shall use
diligent efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both Parties shall proceed
whenever such causes are removed or cease. The Party affected shall provide notice of the Force
Majeure event within a reasonable period of time following such an event.
11 Adoption of Agreements

modifications within sixty (60) days from the Written Notice, any disputes between the Parties
concerning such actions shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process provided for

14 Legal Rights
Execution of this Agreement by either Party does not confirm or imply that the executing Party
agrees with any decision(s) issued pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
consequences of those decisions on specific language in this Agreement. Neither Party waives its

to applicable rules and orders, is intended to expand on the Parties’ rights and obligations as set
forth herein. This Agreement also contains certain provisions that were negotiated without regard
to the Parties’ obligations as set forth Section 251 of the Act. To the extent the provisions of this
Agreement differ from the provisions of any Federal or State Telecommunications statute, rule or
order in effect as of the execution of this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. Each Party shall
comply at its own expense with all other laws of general applicability.
26 Necessar Appro als
Each Party shall be responsible for obtaining and keeping in effect all approvals from, and rights
granted by, governmental authorities, building and property owners, other carriers, and any other
persons that may be required in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in obtaining and
maintaining any required approvals and rights for which such Party is responsible.
27 Good Faith Performance

which a Party’s consent or agreement is required or requested hereunder, such Party shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent or agreement.

provided pursuant to this Agreement, AT&T reserves the right to back bill Neutral Tandem for such
rate or for the difference between the rate actually billed and the rate that should have been billed
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that subject to Neutral Tandem’s agreement to the
limitation regarding billing disputes as described in Section 2.2 of Attachment 7 hereof, AT&T shall
not back bill any amounts for services rendered more than twelve (12) months prior to the date that
the charges or additional charges for such services are actually billed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, both Parties recognize that situations may exist which could necessitate back billing
beyond twelve (12) months. These exceptions are:
(cid:129) Charges connected with jointly provided services whereby meet point billing
guidelines require either Party to rely on records provided by a third party and such
records have not been provided in a timely manner;
(cid:129) Charges incorrectly billed due to erroneous information supplied by the non-billing
Party;
(cid:129) Charges for which a regulatory body has granted, or a regulatory change permits, the

shall implement the true-up by comparing the actual volumes and demand for each item, together
with the rates for each item, with the final prices determined for each item. Each Party shall keep its
own records upon which the true-up can be based, and any final payment from one Party to the
other shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Parties based on such records. In the event of any
discrepancy between the records or disagreement between the Parties regarding the amount of
such true-up, the dispute shall be subject to the dispute resolution process set forth in this
Agreement.

6.2 ODUF Physical File Characteristics
6.2.1 ODUF will be distributed to Neutral Tandem via Secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The ODUF
feed will be a variable block format. The data on the ODUF feed will be in a non-compacted EMI
format (one hundred seventy-five (175) byte format plus modules). It will be created on a daily
basis Monday through Friday except holidays. Details such as dataset name and delivery
schedule will be addressed during negotiations of the distribution medium. There will be a
maximum of one (1) dataset per workday per OCN. If AT&T determines the Secure FTP Mailbox is
nearing capacity levels, AT&T may move the customer to CONNECT:Direct file delivery.
6.2.2 If the customer is moved, CONNECT:Direct data circuits (private line or dial-up) will be required
between AT&T and Neutral Tandem for the purpose of data transmission. Where a dedicated line
is required, Neutral Tandem will be responsible for ordering the circuit, overseeing its installation
and coordinating the installation with AT&T. Neutral Tandem will also be responsible for any
charges associated with this line. Equipment required on the AT&T end to attach the line to the
mainframe computer and to transmit messages successfully on an ongoing basis will be negotiated
on an individual case basis. Any costs incurred for such equipment will be Neutral Tandem’s
responsibility. Where a dial-up facility is required, dial circuits will be installed in the AT&T data

and software, that is required on Neutral Tandem’s end for the purpose of data transmission will be
the responsibility of Neutral Tandem.
6.2.3 If Neutral Tandem utilizes FTP for data file transmission, purchase of the FTP software will be the
responsibility of Neutral Tandem.
6.3 ODUF Packing Specifications
6.3.1 The data will be packed using ATIS EMI records. A pack will contain a minimum of one (1)
message record or a maximum of ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine (99,999)
message records plus a pack header record and a pack trailer record. One transmission can
contain a maximum of ninety-nine (99) packs and a minimum of one (1) pack.
6.3.2 The OCN, From RAO, and Invoice Number will control the invoice sequencing. The From RAO will
be used to identify to Neutral Tandem which AT&T RAO is sending the message. AT&T and
Neutral Tandem will use the invoice sequencing to control data exchange. AT&T will be notified of
sequence failures identified by Neutral Tandem and resend the data as appropriate.
6.4 ODUF Pack Rejection
6.4.1 Neutral Tandem will notify AT&T within one (1) business day of rejected packs (via the mutually
agreed medium). Packs could be rejected because of pack sequencing discrepancies or a critical
edit failure on the Pack Header or Pack Trailer records (e.g., out-of-balance condition on grand
totals, invalid data populated). Standard ATIS EMI error codes will be used. Neutral Tandem will
not be required to return the actual rejected data to AT&T. Rejected packs will be corrected and
retransmitted to Neutral Tandem by AT&T.
6.5 ODUF Control Data

Parties agree to review and discuss the ODUF file content and/or format. For testing of usage
results, AT&T shall request that Neutral Tandem set up a production (live) file. The live test may
consist of Neutral Tandem’s employees making test calls for the types of services Neutral Tandem
requests on ODUF. These test calls are logged by Neutral Tandem, and the logs are provided to
AT&T. These logs will be used to verify the files. Testing will be completed within thirty (30) days
from the date on which the initial test file was sent.

7.2.1 EODUF feed will be distributed to Neutral Tandem via FTP. The EODUF messages will be
intermingled among Neutral Tandem’s ODUF messages. The EODUF will be a variable block
format. The data on the EODUF will be in a non-compacted EMI format (one hundred seventy-five
(175)byte format plus modules). It will be created on a daily basis Monday through Friday except
holiday. If AT&T determines the Secure FTP mailbox is nearing capacity levels, AT&T may move
the customer to CONNECT:Direct file delivery.
7.2.2 Data circuits (private line or dial-up) may be required between AT&T and Neutral Tandem for the
purpose of data transmission. Where a dedicated line is required, Neutral Tandem will be
responsible for ordering the circuit, overseeing its installation and coordinating the installation with
AT&T. Neutral Tandem will also be responsible for any charges associated with this line.
Equipment required on the AT&T end to attach the line to the mainframe computer and to transmit
successfully ongoing will be negotiated on an individual case basis. Where a dial-up facility is
required, dial circuits will be installed in the AT&T data center by AT&T and the associated charges
assessed to Neutral Tandem. Additionally, all message toll charges associated with the use of the
dial circuit by Neutral Tandem will be the responsibility of Neutral Tandem. Associated equipment
on the AT&T end, including a modem, will be negotiated on an individual case basis between the
Parties. All equipment, including modems and software, that is required on Neutral Tandem’s end
for the purpose of data transmission will be the responsibility of Neutral Tandem.
7.2.3 If Neutral Tandem utilizes FTP for data file transmission, purchase of the FTP software will be the
responsibility of Neutral Tandem.
7.3 EODUF Packing Specifications
7.3.1 The data will be packed using ATIS EMI records. A pack will contain a minimum of one (1)
message record or a maximum of ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine (99,999)
message records plus a pack header record and a pack trailer record. One transmission can
contain a maximum of ninety-nine (99) packs and a minimum of one (1) pack.
7.3.2 The OCN, From RAO, and Invoice Number will control the invoice sequencing. The From RAO will
be used to identify to Neutral Tandem which AT&T RAO is sending the message. AT&T and
Neutral Tandem will use the invoice sequencing to control data exchange. AT&T will be notified of
sequence failures identified by Neutral Tandem and resend the data as appropriate.

4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
ACCESS TO NETWORK ELEMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES
1 Introduction
1.1 This Attachment sets forth rates, terms and conditions for unbundled network elements (Network
Elements) and combinations of Network Elements (Combinations) that AT&T offers to Neutral
Tandem for Neutral Tandem’s provision of Telecommunications Services in accordance with its
obligations under Section 251(c)(3) of the Act. Additionally, this Attachment sets forth the rates,
terms and conditions for other facilities and services AT&T makes available to Neutral Tandem
(Other Services). Additionally, the provision of a particular Network Element or Other Service may
require Neutral Tandem to purchase other Network Elements or services. In the event of a conflict
between this Attachment and any other section or provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Attachment shall control.
1.2 The rates for Network Elements, Combinations and Other Services are set forth in Exhibits A
and B. If no rate is identified in this Agreement, the rate will be as set forth in the applicable AT&T
tariff or as negotiated by the Parties upon request by either Party. If Neutral Tandem purchases
service(s) from a tariff, all terms and conditions and rates as set forth in such tariff shall apply. A
one-month minimum billing period shall apply to all Network Elements, Combinations and Other
Services.
1.3 In some cases, Commissions have ordered AT&T to separate its disconnect costs and its
installation costs into two separate nonrecurring charges. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted in
this Agreement, the Commission ordered disconnect charges will be applied at the time the
disconnect activity is performed by AT&T, regardless of whether or not a disconnect order is issued
by Neutral Tandem. Disconnect charges are set forth in the rate exhibit of this Attachment. Neutral
Tandem may purchase and use Network Elements and Other Services from AT&T in accordance
with 47 C.F.R 51.309.
1.4 The Parties shall comply with the requirements as set forth in the technical references within this
Attachment 2.
1.5 Neutral Tandem shall not obtain a Network Element for the exclusive provision of mobile wireless
services or interexchange services.
1.6 Conversion of Wholesale Services to Network Elements or Network Elements to Wholesale
Services. Upon request, AT&T shall convert a wholesale service, or group of wholesale services,
to the equivalent Network Element or Combination that is available to Neutral Tandem pursuant to
Section 251 of the Act and under this Agreement or convert a Network Element or Combination that
is available to Neutral Tandem pursuant to Section 251 of the Act and under this Agreement to an
equivalent wholesale service or group of wholesale services offered by AT&T (collectively
“Conversion”). AT&T shall charge the applicable nonrecurring switch-as-is rates for Conversions
to specific Network Elements or Combinations found in Exhibit A. AT&T shall also charge the same
nonrecurring switch-as-is rates when converting from Network Elements or Combinations. Any rate
change resulting from the Conversion will be effective as of the next billing cycle following AT&T’s
receipt of a complete and accurate Conversion request from Neutral Tandem. A Conversion shall

4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
be considered termination for purposes of any volume and/or term commitments and/or
grandfathered status between Neutral Tandem and AT&T. Any change from a wholesale
service/group of wholesale services to a Network Element/Combination, or from a Network
Element/Combination to a wholesale service/group of wholesale services, that requires a physical
rearrangement will not be considered to be a Conversion for purposes of this Agreement. AT&T
will not require physical rearrangements if the Conversion can be completed through record
changes only. Orders for Conversions will be handled in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the Ordering Guidelines and Processes and CLEC Information Packages as referenced in Sections
1.13.1 and 1.13.2 below.
1.7 Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in this Attachment, in all states, Neutral Tandem
may not maintain unbundled network elements or combinations of unbundled network elements
that are no longer offered pursuant to this Agreement (collectively “Arrangements”). In the event
AT&T determines that Neutral Tandem has in place any Arrangements after the Effective Date of
this Agreement, AT&T will identify such Arrangements and provide Neutral Tandem with thirty (30)
days written notice to disconnect or convert such Arrangements. For orders submitted by Neutral
Tandem within such thirty (30) day period, AT&T will charge the applicable switch-as-is charge set
forth in Exhibit A. If Neutral Tandem fails to submit orders to disconnect or convert such
Arrangements within such thirty (30) day period, AT&T will transition such circuits to the equivalent
tariffed AT&T service(s), and shall charge Neutral Tandem all applicable disconnect charges as set
forth in this Agreement and the full nonrecurring charges for installation of the equivalent tariffed
AT&T service as set forth in AT&T’s tariffs. For all transitions pursuant to this Section 1.7 that
require a physical rearrangement, AT&T shall charge any applicable nonrecurring installation
charges. To the extent no tariff equivalent service exists, AT&T shall disconnect such facility or
Arrangement. The applicable recurring tariff charge shall apply to each circuit as of the Effective
Date of this Agreement.
1.7.1 In addition to the foregoing, for the state of Florida, the applicable recurring tariff charges shall apply
to each circuit beginning the day following the thirty (30) day notice period.
1.7.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the state of Georgia, those circuits for which Neutral Tandem
failed to submit a disconnect or conversion order within such thirty (30) day period and are
subsequently transitioned by AT&T pursuant to this Section 1.7.2 shall be subject to the applicable
switch as is charges set forth in Exhibit A. AT&T shall transition to the equivalent tariff service. To
the extent no tariff equivalent service exists, AT&T shall disconnect such facility or Arrangement.
The applicable recurring resale or tariffed charge shall apply to each circuit as of March 11, 2006.
1.7.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the state of North Carolina, those circuits for which Neutral
Tandem failed to submit a disconnect or conversion order within such thirty (30) day period and are
subsequently transitioned by AT&T pursuant to this Section 1.7.3 shall be subject to applicable
switch-as-is charges.
1.7.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the state of Alabama, the written notice provided by AT&T, as
described in Section 1.7, must identify by circuit identification number the specific Arrangements to
be converted or disconnected. If Neutral Tandem fails to dispute AT&T’s identified Arrangements
or fails to submit orders to disconnect or convert such Arrangements within the established thirty

ATT 2 – NETWORK ELEMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES/AT&T-9STATE
PAGE 5 OF 44
AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
(30)day period, AT&T will transition such circuits to the equivalent tariffed AT&T service(s) subject
to the Commission-established switch-as-is rate. The full nonrecurring charges for installation of
the equivalent tariffed AT&T service as set forth in AT&T’s tariffs will not apply to such conversions.
However, the applicable recurring tariff charges shall apply to each circuit upon conversion.
1.7.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the state of Louisiana, AT&T will provide Neutral Tandem with
written notice identifying the specific Arrangements which must be converted or disconnected.
Neutral Tandem shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to submit orders to
disconnect or convert the Arrangements. Those circuits to be converted to other AT&T services
shall be subject to nonrecurring charges associated with that conversion. If Neutral Tandem
disputes AT&T’s identification of Arrangements to be disconnected or converted, Neutral Tandem
shall send written notice of its dispute within thirty (30) days of AT&T’s notice. AT&T shall not
disconnect the disputed Arrangements while the dispute is being resolved. If the Parties are unable
to reach a voluntary resolution of the dispute, they may petition the Commission for assistance. If
Neutral Tandem does not dispute AT&T’s identification of Arrangements and fails to submit orders
to disconnect or convert such Arrangements within the established thirty (30) day period, AT&T will
transition such circuits to the equivalent tariffed AT&T services subject to the full nonrecurring
charges for installation of the equivalent tariffed AT&T services as set forth in AT&T’s tariffs. The
applicable recurring tariff charges shall apply to each circuit upon conversion.
1.8 AT&T’s Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers as Approved by State Commissions in its Region
(Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers), located on the AT&T Wholesale - Southeast Region Web
site designates those wire centers that, in accordance with Commission orders, met the FCC’s
established criteria for non-impairment, as of March 11, 2005, where certain high capacity (DS1
and above) Loops and high capacity Dedicated Transport are no longer available as Network
Elements. AT&T’s List of Unimpaired Wire Centers in Kentucky and Tennessee (AT&T’s List of
Unimpaired Wire Centers), also located on the AT&T Interconnection Web site, are those wire
centers that AT&T proposed met the FCC’s established criteria for non-impairment as of March 11,
2005 but have not yet been approved by these respective Commissions. AT&T’s List of
Unimpaired Wire Centers shall be subject to modification and/or approval without amendment to
this Agreement upon rulings from the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) and the
Tennessee Regulatory Authority (TRA) in Case No. 2004-00427 and Docket No. 04-00381,
respectively. Once the KPSC and TRA approve the unimpaired wire centers in their respective
states, such approved wire centers shall be added to the Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers.
The Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers and AT&T’s List of Unimpaired Wire Centers shall be
subject to the addition of wire centers without amendment to this Agreement upon subsequent
order(s) from Commission(s). Each such list of additional wire centers shall be considered a
“Subsequent Wire Center List” and future orders in these wire centers shall be subject to the rates,
terms and conditions in Sections 2.1.4.7, 5.2.2.6 and 5.8.1.5 and Exhibit B of this Attachment 2.
Notification of such modification, addition or deletion of wire centers shall be made via AT&T’s
Accessible Letter on the AT&T CLEC Online Web site.
1.9 Upon the Effective Date of this Agreement, Neutral Tandem may not place any new orders for high
capacity Dedicated Transport or high capacity Loops, as applicable, in those wire centers listed on
the Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers and AT&T’s List of Unimpaired Wire Centers. To the
extent Neutral Tandem placed orders after March 10, 2005 for high capacity Loops or high capacity

ATT 2 – NETWORK ELEMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES/AT&T-9STATE

AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
Dedicated Transport in wire centers designated on the Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers, or
AT&T’s List of Unimpaired Wire Centers, within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date of this
Agreement, Neutral Tandem shall submit an LSR(s) or spreadsheet(s), as applicable, identifying
those non-compliant circuits to be disconnected or converted to the equivalent AT&T tariffed
service. AT&T shall bill Neutral Tandem the difference between the UNE recurring rates for such
circuits pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable recurring charges for the equivalent AT&T
tariffed service from the date UNE circuit was installed in the unimpaired wire center to the date the
circuit is disconnected or transitioned to the equivalent AT&T tariffed service. If Neutral Tandem
fails to submit an LSR or spreadsheet identifying such de-listed circuits within thirty (30) days as set
forth above, AT&T will identify such circuits and convert them to the equivalent AT&T tariffed
service, and charge Neutral Tandem applicable disconnect charges for the UNE circuit and the
difference between the UNE recurring rate billed for such circuit and the full non-recurring and
recurring charges for the tariffed service from the date the UNE circuit was installed in the
unimpaired wire center to the date the circuit is transitioned to the equivalent AT&T tariffed service.
To the extent there is no equivalent AT&T tariffed service for the de-listed UNE circuit, AT&T will
disconnect the circuit and bill Neutral Tandem full disconnect charges.
1.9.1 Prior to submitting an order pursuant to this Agreement for high capacity Dedicated Transport or
high capacity Loops, Neutral Tandem shall undertake a reasonably diligent inquiry to determine
whether Neutral Tandem is entitled to unbundled access to such Network Elements in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. By submitting any such order, Neutral Tandem self-certifies that
to the best of Neutral Tandem’s knowledge, the high capacity Dedicated Transport or high capacity
Loop requested is available as a Network Element pursuant to this Agreement. Upon receiving
such order, except in wire centers set forth on the Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers, or
AT&T’s List of Unimpaired Wire Centers, AT&T shall process the request in reliance upon Neutral
Tandem’s self-certification. To the extent AT&T believes that such request does not comply with
the terms of this Agreement, AT&T shall seek dispute resolution in accordance with the General
Terms and Conditions of this Agreement. In the event such dispute is resolved in AT&T’s favor,
AT&T shall bill Neutral Tandem the difference between the rates for such circuits pursuant to this
Agreement and the applicable nonrecurring and recurring charges for the equivalent tariffed service
from the date of installation to the date the circuit is transitioned to the equivalent tariffed service.
Within thirty (30) days following a decision finding in AT&T’s favor, Neutral Tandem shall submit an
LSR(s) or spreadsheet(s) identifying those non-compliant circuits to be transitioned to tariffed
services or disconnected.
1.9.2 In the event that (1) AT&T designated a wire center as unimpaired as set forth on the Master List of
Unimpaired Wire Centers on the AT&T Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site, or AT&T’s List of
Unimpaired Wire Centers, (2) as a result of such designation, Neutral Tandem converted high
capacity Dedicated Transport or high capacity Loops to other services or ordered new services as
services other than high capacity Dedicated Transport or high capacity Loop Network Elements
subsequent to March 10, 2005, (3) Neutral Tandem otherwise would have been entitled to high
capacity Dedicated Transport or high capacity Loops in such wire center at the time such
alternative services were provisioned, and (4) AT&T acknowledges, or a state or federal regulatory
body with authority determines, that, at the time AT&T designated such wire center as unimpaired,
such wire center did not meet the FCC’s unimpairment criteria, then upon request of Neutral
Tandem consistent with the applicable ordering processes as reflected in the Guides located on

request from AT&T at the time of the trouble report, Neutral Tandem will be required to provide the
results of the Neutral Tandem test which indicate a problem on the AT&T network.
1.13.4.2 Once Neutral Tandem has isolated a trouble to the AT&T network, and has issued a trouble report
to AT&T, AT&T will take the actions necessary to repair the Network Element when trouble is found.
AT&T will repair its network facilities to its wholesale customers in the same time frames that AT&T
repairs similar services to its retail customers.
1.13.4.3 If Neutral Tandem reports a trouble on an AT&T Network Element and no trouble is found in
AT&T’s network, AT&T will charge Neutral Tandem a Maintenance of Service Charge for any
dispatching and testing (both inside and outside the CO) required by AT&T in order to confirm the
Network Element’s working status. AT&T will assess the applicable Maintenance of Service rates
from BellSouth’s FCC No.1 Tariff, Section 13.3.1.
1.13.4.4 In the event AT&T must dispatch to the customer’s location more than once due to incorrect or
incomplete information provided by Neutral Tandem (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect contact
name/number, etc.), AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem for each additional dispatch required to repair
the Network Element due to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T will assess the
applicable Maintenance of Service rates from BellSouth’s FCC No.1 Tariff, Section 13.3.1.
2 Loops
2.1 General. The local loop Network Element is defined as a transmission facility that AT&T provides
pursuant to this Attachment between a distribution frame (or its equivalent) in AT&T’s central office
and the loop demarcation point at a customer premises (Loop). Facilities that do not terminate at a
demarcation point at a customer premises, including, by way of example, but not limited to, facilities
that terminate to another carrier’s switch or premises, a cell site, Mobile Switching Center or base
station, do not constitute local Loops. The Loop Network Element includes all features, functions,
and capabilities of the transmission facilities, including the network interface device, and attached
electronics (except those used for the provision of advanced services, such as Digital Subscriber
Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs)), optronics and intermediate devices (including repeaters and
load coils) used to establish the transmission path to the customer’s premises, including inside wire
owned or controlled by AT&T. Neutral Tandem shall purchase the entire bandwidth of the Loop
and, except as required herein or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, AT&T shall not subdivide
the frequency of the Loop.
2.1.1 The Loop does not include any packet switched features, functions or capabilities.
2.1.2 Fiber to the Home (FTTH) loops are local loops consisting entirely of fiber optic cable, whether dark
or lit, serving a customer’s premises or, in the case of predominantly residential multiple dwelling
units (MDUs), a fiber optic cable, whether dark or lit, that extends to the MDU minimum point of
entry (MPOE). Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) loops are local loops consisting of fiber optic cable
connecting to a copper distribution plant that is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the
customer’s premises or, in the case of predominantly residential MDUs, not more than five hundred
(500)feet from the MDU’s MPOE. The fiber optic cable in a FTTC loop must connect to a copper
distribution plant at a serving area interface from which every other copper distribution subloop also
is not more than five hundred (500) feet from the respective customer’s premises.

AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
2.1.2.1 In new build (Greenfield) areas, where AT&T has only deployed FTTH/FTTC facilities, AT&T is
under no obligation to provide Loops. FTTH facilities include fiber loops deployed to the MPOE of a
MDU that is predominantly residential regardless of the ownership of the inside wiring from the
MPOE to each customer in the MDU.
2.1.2.2 In FTTH/FTTC overbuild situations where AT&T also has copper Loops, AT&T will make those
copper Loops available to Neutral Tandem on an unbundled basis, until such time as AT&T
chooses to retire those copper Loops using the FCC’s network disclosure requirements. In these
cases, AT&T will offer a sixty-four (64) kilobits per second (kbps) voice grade channel over its
FTTH/FTTC facilities.
2.1.2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the states of Alabama and Louisiana, AT&T shall make available
DS1 and DS3 Loops in any wire center where AT&T is required to provide such Loop facilities. In
the states of North Carolina and South Carolina, AT&T shall make available DS1 Loops in any wire
center where AT&T is required to provide such Loop facilities.
2.1.2.4 Furthermore, in FTTH/FTTC overbuild areas where AT&T has not yet retired copper facilities, AT&T
is not obligated to ensure that such copper Loops in that area are capable of transmitting signals
prior to receiving a request for access to such Loops by Neutral Tandem. If a request is received
by AT&T for a copper Loop, and the copper facilities have not yet been retired, AT&T will restore
the copper Loop to serviceable condition if technically feasible. Except for the state of Georgia, in
these instances of Loop orders in an FTTH/FTTC overbuild area, AT&T’s standard Loop
provisioning interval will not apply, and the order will be handled on a project basis by which the
Parties will negotiate the applicable provisioning interval. For the state of Georgia, in these
instances of Loop orders in an FTTH/FTTC overbuild area, AT&T’s standard Loop provisioning
interval will apply.
2.1.3 A hybrid Loop is a local Loop, composed of both fiber optic cable, usually in the feeder plant, and
copper twisted wire or cable, usually in the distribution plant. AT&T shall provide Neutral Tandem
access to hybrid Loops pursuant to the requirements of 47 C.F.R. 51.319(a)(2). AT&T is not
required to provide access to the packet switched features, functions and capabilities of its hybrid
Loops.
2.1.3.1 AT&T shall not engineer the transmission capabilities of its network in a manner, or engage in any
policy, practice, or procedure, that disrupts or degrades access to a local Loop or Subloop,
including the time division multiplexing-based features, functions and capabilities of a hybrid Loop,
for which a requesting telecommunications carrier may obtain or has obtained access pursuant to
this Attachment.
2.1.4 DS1 and DS3 Loop Requirements
2.1.4.1 For purposes of this Section 2, a Business Line is defined in 47 C.F.R. 51.5.
2.1.4.2 For purposes of this Section 2, a “Fiber-Based Collocator” is defined in 47 C.F.R. 51.5.

above but that were not included in the Master List of Unimpaired Wire Centers and AT&T’s List of
Unimpaired Wire Centers, AT&T shall include such additional wire centers in an Accessible Letter.
Each such list of additional wire centers shall be considered a “Subsequent Wire Center List”.
AT&T will follow any notification procedures set forth in applicable Commission orders.
2.1.4.7.2 Neutral Tandem shall have thirty (30) business days to dispute the additional wire centers listed on
AT&T’s Accessible Letter. Absent such dispute, effective thirty (30) business days after the date of
an AT&T Accessible Letter providing a Subsequent Wire Center List, AT&T shall not be required to
unbundle DS1 and/or DS3 Loops, as applicable, in such additional wire center(s), except pursuant
to the self-certification process as set forth in Section 1.8 of this Attachment.
2.1.4.7.2.1 For purposes of Section 2.1.4.7 above, AT&T shall make available DS1 and DS3 Loops that were
in service for Neutral Tandem in a wire center on the Subsequent Wire Center List as of the thirtieth
(30th) business day after the date of AT&T’s Accessible Letter identifying the Subsequent Wire

applicable, identifying the Subsequent Embedded Base of circuits to be disconnected or converted
to other AT&T services.
2.1.4.7.2.3.1 In the case of disconnection, the applicable disconnect charges set forth in this Agreement shall
apply.
2.1.4.7.2.3.2 If Neutral Tandem fails to submit the LSR(s) or spreadsheet(s) for all of its Subsequent Embedded
Base by one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of AT&T’s Accessible Letter identifying the
Subsequent Wire Center List, AT&T will identify Neutral Tandem’s remaining Subsequent
Embedded Base, if any, and will transition such circuits to the equivalent tariffed AT&T service(s).
In the states of Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina, those circuits identified and transitioned by
AT&T shall be subject to the applicable disconnect charges as set forth in this Agreement and the
full nonrecurring charges for installation of the equivalent tariffed AT&T service as set forth in
AT&T’s tariffs. In the states of Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, those circuits identified and
transitioned by AT&T shall be subject to the applicable switch-as-is rates set forth in Exhibit A of
Attachment 2. In the state of Louisiana, those circuits identified and transitioned by AT&T shall be
subject to the full nonrecurring charges for installation of the equivalent tariffed AT&T service as set
forth in AT&T’s tariffs.
2.1.4.7.2.3.3 For Subsequent Embedded Base circuits converted pursuant to Section 2.1.4.7.2.3 above or
transitioned pursuant to Section 2.1.4.7.2.3.2 above, the applicable recurring tariff charges shall
apply as of the earlier of the date each circuit is converted or transitioned, as applicable, or the first
day after the end of the Subsequent Transition Period.
2.1.5 Where facilities are available, AT&T will install Loops in compliance with AT&T’s Products and
Services Interval Guide available at AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. For orders of
fifteen (15) or more Loops, the installation and any applicable Order Coordination (OC) as
described below will be handled on a project basis, and the intervals will be set by the AT&T project
manager for that order. When Loops require a Service Inquiry (SI) prior to issuing the order to
determine if facilities are available, the interval for the SI process is separate from the installation
interval.
2.1.6 The Loop shall be provided to Neutral Tandem in accordance with AT&T’s TR73600 Unbundled
Local Loop Technical Specification and applicable industry standard technical references.
2.1.7 AT&T will only provision, maintain and repair the Loops to the standards that are consistent with the
type of Loop ordered.
2.1.7.1 When an AT&T technician is required to be dispatched to provision the Loop, AT&T will tag the
Loop with the Circuit ID number and the name of the ordering CLEC. When a dispatch is not
required to provision the Loop, AT&T will tag the Loop on the next required visit to the customer’s
location. If Neutral Tandem wants to ensure the Loop is tagged during the provisioning process for
Loops that may not require a dispatch (e.g., UVL-SL1, UVL-SL2, and UCL-ND), Neutral Tandem
may order Loop Tagging. Rates for Loop Tagging are as set forth in Exhibit A.
2.1.7.2 For voice grade Loop orders (or orders for Loops intended to provide voice grade services),
Neutral Tandem shall have dial-tone available for that Loop forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Loop

well as Service Rearrangements as set forth in Section 2.1.12. Where Neutral Tandem dial-tone is
not available on the conversion date the Loop will not be cut over and the Loop order will be
returned to Neutral Tandem for rescheduling.
2.1.8 OC and Order Coordination-Time Specific (OC-TS)
2.1.8.1 OC allows AT&T and Neutral Tandem to coordinate the installation of the SL2 Loops, Unbundled
Digital Loops (UDL) and other Loops where OC may be purchased as an option, to Neutral
Tandem’s facilities to limit customer service outage. OC is available when the Loop is provisioned
over an existing circuit that is currently providing service to the customer. OC for physical
conversions will be scheduled at AT&T’s discretion during normal working hours on the committed
due date. OC shall be provided in accordance with the chart set forth below.
2.1.8.2 OC-TS allows Neutral Tandem to order a specific time for OC to take place. AT&T will make
commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Neutral Tandem’s specific conversion time
request. However, AT&T reserves the right to negotiate with Neutral Tandem a conversion time
based on load and appointment control when necessary. This OC-TS is a chargeable option for all
Loops except Unbundled Copper Loops (UCL) and is billed in addition to the OC charge. Neutral
Tandem may specify a time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (location time) Monday through
Friday (excluding holidays). If Neutral Tandem specifies a time outside this window, or selects a
time or quantity of Loops that requires AT&T technicians to work outside normal work hours,
overtime charges will apply in addition to the OC and OC-TS charges. Overtime charges will be
applied based on the amount of overtime worked and in accordance with the rates established in
AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff, Section E13.2, for each state. The OC-TS charges for an
order due on the same day at the same location will be applied on a per LSR basis.

2.1.11.1 AT&T will make available to Neutral Tandem a Bulk Migration process pursuant to which Neutral
Tandem may request to migrate port/loop combinations, provisioned pursuant to a separate
agreement between the parties, to Loops (UNE-L). The Bulk Migration process may be used if
such loop/port combinations are (1) associated with two (2) or more Existing Account Telephone
Numbers (EATNs); and (2) located in the same Central Office. The terms and conditions for use of
the Bulk Migration process are described in the AT&T CLEC Information Package. The CLEC
Information Package is located on AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. The rates for
the Bulk Migration process shall be the nonrecurring rates associated with the Loop type being
requested on the Bulk Migration, as set forth in Exhibit A. Additionally, OSS charges will also apply.
Loops connected to Integrated Digital Loop Carrier (IDLC) systems will be migrated pursuant to
Section 2.6 below.
2.1.11.2 Should Neutral Tandem request migration for two (2) or more EATNs containing fifteen (15) or
more circuits, Neutral Tandem must use the Bulk Migration process referenced in 2.1.11.1 above.
2.1.12 Unbundled Loop (DS1 and below) Service Rearrangements
2.1.12.1 The Unbundled Loop Service Rearrangement processes will allow changes to be made to a
working Loop facility assignment within the same end-user serving wire center. Service
Rearrangements will result in service outages to the customer during the time the Loop is being
moved.
2.1.12.2 An Unbundled Loop Service Rearrangement connecting facility change (CFC) allows Neutral
Tandem to change its installed Loop from one working facility assignment to another facility
assignment. CFC includes Connecting Facility Assignment (CFA) and Cable ID & Pair changes
within same collocation arrangement or from collocation to collocation. CFA changes are allowed
within the same multiplexer or from one multiplexer to another multiplexer. For a CFC, the Loop
class of service, Loop type and the customer must remain the same.
2.1.12.3 An Unbundled Loop Service Rearrangement connecting facility move (CFM) allows Neutral
Tandem to move the Loop facility assignment from a collocation arrangement to a multiplexer or
from a multiplexer to a collocation arrangement. CFMs require a change to the Loop basic class of
service. The Loop type and the customer must remain the same.
2.1.12.4 For Unbundled Loop Service Rearrangements, AT&T shall charge the applicable “Service
Rearrangement change in Loop facility” rate found in Exhibit A.
2.1.12.5 The Unbundled Loop Service Rearrangement process and requirements will be handled in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Ordering Guidelines and CLEC Information
Packages as referenced in Sections 1.13.1 and 1.13.2 above.

2.1.13 EEL to Loop Retermination
2.1.13.1 Neutral Tandem may utilize the EEL to Loop Retermination process to disconnect an EEL circuit
and reterminate the Loop portion of the former EEL circuit to a collocation arrangement in the end-
user’s Serving Wire Center (EU SWC).
2.1.13.2 This process is available when the existing Loop portion of the EEL will be re-used and the resulting
Loop will be subject to the rates, terms and conditions for that particular Loop as set forth in this
Attachment. This process will apply only to EELs that include as a part of its combination a DS1
Loop, UVL-SL2 Loop, 4-Wire UDL Loop (64, 56 kbs) and a 2-Wire ISDN Loop.
2.1.13.3 AT&T shall charge the applicable EEL to Loop Retermination rates found in Exhibit A. Neutral
Tandem shall also be charged applicable manual service order, collocation cross-connect and EEL
(including the Transport and Loop portions of the EEL) disconnect charges as set forth in Exhibit A
of this Attachment.
2.1.13.4 The EEL to Loop Retermination process is not available when a dispatch outside the serving wire
center where the Loop terminates is required. If an outside dispatch is required, or if the Loop
portion of the EEL is not one of the Loop types referenced in Section 2.1.13.2 above, or if Neutral
Tandem elects not to utilize the EEL to Loop Retermination process, Neutral Tandem must submit
an LSR to disconnect the entire EEL circuit, and must submit a separate LSR for the requested
standalone Loop. In such cases, Neutral Tandem will be charged the EEL disconnect charges and
the full nonrecurring rates for installation of a new Loop, as set forth in Exhibit A.
2.1.13.5 The EEL to Loop Retermination process and requirements will be handled in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in the Ordering Guidelines and CLEC Information Packages as referenced in
Sections 1.13.1 and 1.13.2 above.
2.2 Unbundled Voice Loops (UVLs)
2.2.1 AT&T shall make available the following UVLs:
2.2.1.1 2-wire Analog Voice Grade Loop – SL1 (Non-Designed);
2.2.1.2 2-wire Analog Voice Grade Loop – SL2 (Designed); or
2.2.1.3 4-wire Analog Voice Grade Loop (Designed).
2.2.2 UVL may be provisioned using any type of facility that will support voice grade services. This may
include loaded copper, non-loaded copper, digital loop carrier systems, fiber/copper combination
(hybrid loop) or a combination of any of these facilities. AT&T, in the normal course of maintaining,
repairing, and configuring its network, may also change the facilities that are used to provide any
given voice grade circuit. This change may occur at any time. In these situations, AT&T will only
ensure that the newly provided facility will support voice grade services. AT&T will not guarantee

2.2.3 Unbundled Voice Loop - SL1 (UVL-SL1). Loops are 2-wire loop start circuits, will be non-designed,
and will not have remote access test points. OC will be offered as a chargeable option on SL1
Loops when reuse of existing facilities has been requested by Neutral Tandem, however, OC is
always required on UCLs that involve the reuse of facilities that are currently providing service.
Neutral Tandem may also order OC-TS when a specified conversion time is requested. OC-TS is a
chargeable option for any coordinated order and is billed in addition to the OC charge. An
Engineering Information (EI) document can be ordered as a chargeable option. The EI document
provides Loop Make-Up information which is similar to the information normally provided in a
Design Layout Record (DLR). Upon issuance of a non-coordinated order in the service order
system, SL1 Loops will be activated on the due date in the same manner and time frames that
AT&T normally activates POTS-type Loops for its customers.
2.2.4 For an additional charge AT&T will make available Loop Testing so that Neutral Tandem may
request further testing on new UVL-SL1 Loops. Rates for Loop Testing are as set forth in Exhibit A.
2.2.5 Unbundled Voice Loop – SL2 (UVL-SL2). Loops may be 2-wire or 4-wire circuits, shall have
remote access test points, and will be designed with a DLR provided to Neutral Tandem. SL2
circuits can be provisioned with loop start, ground start or reverse battery signaling. OC is provided
as a standard feature on SL2 Loops. The OC feature will allow Neutral Tandem to coordinate the
installation of the Loop with the disconnect of an existing customer’s service and/or number
portability service. In these cases, AT&T will perform the order conversion with standard order
coordination at its discretion during normal work hours.
2.3 Unbundled Digital Loops
2.3.1 AT&T will offer UDLs. UDLs are service specific, will be designed, will be provisioned with test

transport is a metallic-based electrical interface.
2.3.10 Both DS3 Loop and STS-1 Loop require a SI in order to ascertain availability.
2.3.11 DS3 services come with a test point and a DLR. Mileage is airline miles, rounded up and a
®
minimum of one (1) mile applies. AT&T’s TR73501 LightGate Service Interface and Performance
Specifications, Issue D, June 1995 applies to DS3 services.
2.3.12 Neutral Tandem may obtain a maximum of a single Unbundled DS3 Loop to any single building in
which DS3 Loops are available as Unbundled Loops.
2.4 Unbundled Copper Loops (UCL).
2.4.1 AT&T shall make available UCLs. The UCL is a copper twisted pair Loop that is unencumbered by
any intervening equipment (e.g., filters, load coils, range extenders, digital loop carrier, or
repeaters) and is not intended to support any particular telecommunications service. The UCL will
be offered in two (2) types – Designed and Non-Designed.
2.4.2 Unbundled Copper Loop – Designed (UCL-D)
2.4.2.1 The UCL-D will be provisioned as a dry copper twisted pair (2-wire or 4-wire) Loop that is
unencumbered by any intervening equipment (e.g., filters, load coils, range extenders, digital loop
carrier, or repeaters).
2.4.2.2 A UCL-D will be eighteen thousand (18,000) feet or less in length and is provisioned according to
Resistance Design parameters, may have up to six thousand (6,000) feet of bridged tap and will
have up to thirteen hundred (1300) Ohms of resistance.
2.4.2.3 The UCL-D is a designed circuit, is provisioned with a test point, and comes standard with a DLR.
OC is a chargeable option for a UCL-D; however, OC is always required on UCLs where a reuse of
existing facilities has been requested by Neutral Tandem.
2.4.2.4 These Loops are not intended to support any particular services and may be utilized by Neutral
Tandem to provide a wide-range of telecommunications services as long as those services do not
adversely affect AT&T’s network. This facility will include a Network Interface Device (NID) at the
customer’s location for the purpose of connecting the Loop to the customer’s inside wire.
2.4.3 Unbundled Copper Loop – Non-Designed (UCL-ND)
2.4.3.1 The UCL–ND is provisioned as a dedicated 2-wire metallic transmission facility from AT&T’s Main
Distribution Frame (MDF) to a customer’s premises (including the NID). The UCL-ND will be a “dry

PAGE 20 OF 44
AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
between the customer’s premises and the serving wire center. The UCL-ND typically will be
thirteen hundred (1300) Ohms resistance and in most cases will not exceed eighteen thousand
(18,000) feet in length, although the UCL-ND will not have a specific length limitation. For Loops
less than eighteen thousand (18,000) feet and with less than thirteen hundred (1300) Ohms
resistance, the Loop will provide a voice grade transmission channel suitable for loop start signaling
and the transport of analog voice grade signals. The UCL-ND will not be designed and will not be
provisioned with either a DLR or a test point.
2.4.3.2 The UCL-ND facilities may be mechanically assigned using AT&T’s assignment systems.
Therefore, the Loop Makeup (LMU) process is not required to order and provision the UCL-ND.
However, Neutral Tandem can request LMU for which additional charges would apply.
2.4.3.3 For an additional charge, AT&T also will make available Loop Testing so that Neutral Tandem may
request further testing on the UCL-ND. Rates for Loop Testing are as set forth in Exhibit A.
2.4.3.4 UCL-ND Loops are not intended to support any particular service and may be utilized by Neutral
Tandem to provide a wide-range of telecommunications services as long as those services do not
adversely affect AT&T’s network. The UCL-ND will include a NID at the customer’s location for the
purpose of connecting the Loop to the customer’s inside wire.
2.4.3.5 OC will be provided as a chargeable option and may be utilized when the UCL-ND provisioning is
associated with the reuse of AT&T facilities. OC-TS does not apply to this product.
2.4.3.6 Neutral Tandem may use AT&T’s Unbundled Loop Modification (ULM) offering to remove
excessive bridged taps and/or load coils from any copper Loop within the AT&T network.
Therefore, some Loops that would not qualify as UCL-ND could be transformed into Loops that do
qualify, using the ULM process.
2.5 Unbundled Loop Modifications (Line Conditioning)
2.5.1 Line Conditioning is defined as routine network modification that AT&T regularly undertakes to
provide xDSL services to its own customers. This may include the removal of any device, from a
copper Loop or copper Subloop that may diminish the capability of the Loop or Subloop to deliver
high-speed switched wireline telecommunications capability, including xDSL service. Such devices
include, load coils, excessive bridged taps, low pass filters, and range extenders. Excessive
bridged taps are bridged taps that serves no network design purpose and that are beyond the limits
set according to industry standards and/or the AT&T’s TR 73600 Unbundled Local Loop Technical
Specification. AT&T shall provide Line Conditioning on Loops, as requested by Neutral Tandem,
even in instances where AT&T does not provide advanced services to the end user on that Loop.
2.5.2 AT&T will remove load coils only on copper Loops that are equal to or less than eighteen thousand
(18,000) feet in length. AT&T will remove load coils on copper Subloops where the total loop
distance (feeder plus distribution) from the AT&T central office to the end user is equal to or less
than 18,000 feet or, if there is no copper feeder, the distance from the remote terminal (RT) to the
end user is equal to or less than 18,000 feet.

2.5.3 For any copper loop being ordered by Neutral Tandem which has over six thousand (6,000) feet of
combined bridged tap will be modified, upon request from Neutral Tandem, so that the loop will
have a maximum of six thousand (6,000) feet of bridged tap. This modification will be performed at
no additional charge to Neutral Tandem. Loop conditioning orders that require the removal of
bridged tap that serves no network design purpose on a copper Loop that will result in a combined
total of bridged tap between two thousand five hundred (2,500) and six thousand (6,000) feet will be
performed at the rates set forth in Exhibit A.
2.5.4 Neutral Tandem may request removal of any unnecessary and non-excessive bridged tap (bridged
tap between zero (0) and two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet which serves no network design
purpose), at rates pursuant to AT&T’s SC Process as mutually agreed to by the Parties.
2.5.5 Rates for ULM are as set forth in Exhibit A.
2.5.6 AT&T will not modify a Loop in such a way that it no longer meets the technical parameters of the
original Loop type (e.g., voice grade, ADSL, etc.) being ordered.
2.5.7 If Neutral Tandem requests ULM on a reserved facility for a new Loop order, AT&T may perform a
pair change and provision a different Loop facility in lieu of the reserved facility with ULM if feasible.
The Loop provisioned will meet or exceed specifications of the requested Loop facility as modified.
Neutral Tandem will not be charged for ULM if a different Loop is provisioned. For Loops that
require a DLR or its equivalent, AT&T will provide LMU detail of the Loop provisioned.
2.5.8 Neutral Tandem shall request Loop make up information pursuant to this Attachment prior to
submitting a service inquiry and/or a LSR for the Loop type that Neutral Tandem desires AT&T to
condition.
2.5.9 When requesting ULM for a Loop that AT&T has previously provisioned for Neutral Tandem,
Neutral Tandem will submit a SI to AT&T. If a spare Loop facility that meets the Loop modification
specifications requested by Neutral Tandem is available at the location for which the ULM was
requested, Neutral Tandem will have the option to change the Loop facility to the qualifying spare
facility rather than to provide ULM. In the event that AT&T changes the Loop facility in lieu of
providing ULM, Neutral Tandem will not be charged for ULM but will only be charged the service
order charges for submitting an order.
2.6 Loop Provisioning Involving IDLC
2.6.1 Where Neutral Tandem has requested an Unbundled Loop and AT&T uses IDLC systems to
provide the local service to the customer and AT&T has a suitable alternate facility available, AT&T
will make such alternative facilities available to Neutral Tandem. If a suitable alternative facility is
not available, then to the extent it is technically feasible, AT&T will implement one of the following
alternative arrangements for Neutral Tandem (e.g., hairpinning):
1. Roll the circuit(s) from the IDLC to any spare copper that exists to the customer premises.
2. Roll the circuit(s) from the IDLC to an existing DLC that is not integrated.
3. If capacity exists, provide "side-door" porting through the switch.

4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
4. If capacity exists, provide "Digital Access Cross-Connect System (DACS)-door" porting (if the
IDLC routes through a DACS prior to integration into the switch).
2.6.2 Arrangements 3 and 4 above require the use of a designed circuit. Therefore, non-designed Loops
such as the SL1 voice grade and UCL-ND may not be ordered in these cases.
2.6.2.1 If no alternate facility is available, and upon request from Neutral Tandem, and if agreed to by both
Parties, AT&T may utilize its SC process to determine the additional costs required to provision
facilities. Neutral Tandem will then have the option of paying the one-time SC rates to place the
Loop.
2.7 Network Interface Device
2.7.1 The NID is defined as any means of interconnection of the customer’s customer premises wiring to
AT&T’s distribution plant, such as a cross-connect device used for that purpose. The NID is a
single line termination device or that portion of a multiple line termination device required to
terminate a single line or circuit at the premises. The NID features two (2) independent chambers
or divisions that separate the service provider’s network from the customer’s premises wiring.
Each chamber or division contains the appropriate connection points or posts to which the service
provider and the customer each make their connections. The NID provides a protective ground
connection and is capable of terminating cables such as twisted pair cable.
2.7.2 AT&T shall permit Neutral Tandem to connect Neutral Tandem’s Loop facilities to the customer’s
customer premises wiring through the AT&T NID or at any other technically feasible point.
2.7.3 Access to NID
2.7.3.1 Neutral Tandem may access the customer’s premises wiring by any of the following means and
Neutral Tandem shall not disturb the existing form of electrical protection and shall maintain the
physical integrity of the NID:
2.7.3.1.1 AT&T shall allow Neutral Tandem to connect its Loops directly to AT&T’s multi-line residential NID
enclosures that have additional space and are not used by AT&T or any other telecommunications
carriers to provide service to the premises;
2.7.3.1.2 Where an adequate length of the customer’s customer premises wiring is present and
environmental conditions permit, either Party may remove the customer premises wiring from the
other Party’s NID and connect such wiring to that Party’s own NID;
2.7.3.1.3 Either Party may enter the subscriber access chamber or dual chamber NID enclosures for the
purpose of extending a cross-connect or spliced jumper wire from the customer premises wiring
through a suitable “punch-out” hole of such NID enclosures; or
2.7.3.1.4 Neutral Tandem may request AT&T to make other rearrangements to the customer premises wiring
terminations or terminal enclosure on a time and materials cost basis.
2.7.3.2 In no case shall either Party remove or disconnect the other Party’s loop facilities from either
Party’s NIDs, enclosures, or protectors unless the applicable Commission has expressly permitted

the same and the disconnecting Party provides prior notice to the other Party. In such cases, it
shall be the responsibility of the Party disconnecting loop facilities to leave undisturbed the existing
form of electrical protection and to maintain the physical integrity of the NID. It will be Neutral
Tandem’s responsibility to ensure there is no safety hazard, and Neutral Tandem will hold AT&T
harmless for any liability associated with the removal of the AT&T Loop from the AT&T NID.
Furthermore, it shall be the responsibility of the disconnecting Party, once the other Party’s loop
has been disconnected from the NID, to reconnect the disconnected loop to a nationally recognized
testing laboratory listed station protector, which has been grounded as per Article 800 of the
National Electrical Code. If no spare station protector exists in the NID, the disconnected loop must
be appropriately cleared, capped and stored.
2.7.3.3 Neutral Tandem shall not remove or disconnect ground wires from AT&T’s NIDs, enclosures, or
protectors.
2.7.3.4 Neutral Tandem shall not remove or disconnect NID modules, protectors, or terminals from AT&T’s
NID enclosures.
2.7.3.5 Due to the wide variety of NID enclosures and outside plant environments, AT&T will work with
Neutral Tandem to develop specific procedures to establish the most effective means of
implementing this section if the procedures set forth herein do not apply to the NID in question.
2.7.4 Technical Requirements
2.7.4.1 The NID shall provide an accessible point of interconnection and shall maintain a connection to
ground.
2.7.4.2 If an existing NID is accessed, it shall be capable of transferring electrical analog or digital signals
between the customer’s customer premises and the distribution media and/or cross-connect to
Neutral Tandem’s NID.
2.7.4.3 Existing AT&T NIDs will be operational and provided in “as is” condition. Neutral Tandem may
request AT&T to do additional work to the NID on a time and material basis. When Neutral Tandem
deploys its own local loops in a multiple-line termination device, Neutral Tandem shall specify the
quantity of NID connections that it requires within such device.
2.8 Subloop Distribution Elements.
2.8.1 Where facilities permit, AT&T shall offer access to its Unbundled Subloop Distribution (USLD)
elements in accordance with 47 C.F.R. 51.319(b) as specified herein.
2.8.2 Unbundled Subloop Distribution
2.8.2.1 The USLD facility is a dedicated transmission facility that AT&T provides from a customer’s point of
demarcation to an AT&T cross-connect device. The AT&T cross-connect device may be located
within a remote terminal (RT) or a stand-alone cross-box in the field or in the equipment room of a
building. The USLD media is a copper twisted pair that can be provisioned as a 2-wire or 4-wire

USLD – Voice Grade (USLD-VG)
Unbundled Copper Subloop (UCSL)
USLD – Intrabuilding Network Cable (USLD-INC (aka riser cable))
2.8.2.2 USLD-VG is a copper subloop facility from the cross-box in the field up to and including the point of
demarcation at the customer’s premises and may have load coils.
2.8.2.3 UCSL is a copper facility eighteen thousand (18,000) feet or less in length provided from the cross-
box in the field up to and including the customer’s point of demarcation. If available, this facility will
not have any intervening equipment such as load coils between the customer and the cross-box.
2.8.2.3.1 If Neutral Tandem requests a UCSL and it is not available, Neutral Tandem may request the copper
Subloop facility be modified pursuant to the ULM process to remove load coils and/or excessive
bridged taps. If load coils and/or excessive bridged taps are removed, the facility will be classified
as a UCSL.
2.8.2.4 USLD-INC is the distribution facility owned or controlled by AT&T inside a building or between
buildings on the same property that is not separated by a public street or road. USLD-INC includes
the facility from the cross-connect device in the building equipment room up to and including the
point of demarcation at the customer’s premises.
2.8.2.4.1 Upon request for USLD-INC from Neutral Tandem, AT&T will install a cross-connect panel in the
building equipment room for the purpose of accessing USLD-INC pairs from a building equipment
room. The cross-connect panel will function as a single point of interconnection (SPOI) for USLD-
INC and will be accessible by multiple carriers as space permits. AT&T will place cross-connect
blocks in twenty five (25) pair increments for Neutral Tandem’s use on this cross-connect panel.
Neutral Tandem will be responsible for connecting its facilities to the twenty five (25) pair cross-
connect block(s).
2.8.2.5 For access to Voice Grade USLD and UCSL, Neutral Tandem shall install a cable to the AT&T
cross-box pursuant to the terms and conditions for physical collocation for remote sites set forth in
Attachment 4. This cable would be connected by an AT&T technician within the AT&T cross-box
during the set-up process. Neutral Tandem’s cable pairs can then be connected to AT&T’s USL
within the AT&T cross-box by the AT&T technician.
2.8.2.6 Through the SI process, AT&T will determine whether access to USLs at the location requested by
Neutral Tandem is technically feasible and whether sufficient capacity exists in the cross-box. If
existing capacity is sufficient to meet Neutral Tandem’s request, then AT&T will perform the site set-
up as described in the CLEC Information Package, located at AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast
Region Web site.
2.8.2.7 The site set-up must be completed before Neutral Tandem can order Subloop pairs. For the site
set-up in an AT&T cross-connect box in the field, AT&T will perform the necessary work to splice
Neutral Tandem’s cable into the cross-connect box. For the site set-up inside a building equipment
room, AT&T will perform the necessary work to install the cross-connect panel and the connecting
block(s) that will be used to provide access to the requested USLs.

requests reuse of an existing facility, and the OC charge shall be billed in addition to the USL pair
rate. For expedite requests by Neutral Tandem for Subloop pairs, expedite charges will apply for
intervals less than five (5) days.
2.8.2.9 USLs will be provided in accordance with AT&T’s TR 73600 Unbundled Local Loop Technical
Specifications.
2.8.3 Unbundled Network Terminating Wire (UNTW)
2.8.3.1 UNTW is unshielded twisted copper wiring that is used to extend circuits from an intra-building
network cable terminal or from a building entrance terminal to an individual customer’s point of
demarcation. It is the final portion of the Loop that in multi-subscriber configurations represents the
point at which the network branches out to serve individual subscribers.
2.8.3.2 This element will be provided in MDUs and/or Multi-Tenants Units (MTUs) where either Party owns
wiring all the way to the customer’s premises. Neither Party will provide this element in locations
where the property owner provides its own wiring to the customer’s premises, where a third party
owns the wiring to the customer’s premises.
2.8.3.3 Requirements
2.8.3.3.1 On a multi-unit premises, upon request of the other Party (Requesting Party), the Party owning the
network terminating wire (Provisioning Party) will provide access to UNTW pairs on an Access
Terminal that is suitable for use by multiple carriers at each Garden Terminal or Wiring Closet.
2.8.3.3.2 The Provisioning Party shall not be required to install new or additional NTW beyond existing NTW
to provision the services of the Requesting Party.
2.8.3.3.3 In existing MDUs and/or MTUs in which AT&T does not own or control wiring (INC/NTW) to the
customers premises, and Neutral Tandem does own or control such wiring, Neutral Tandem will
install UNTW Access Terminals for AT&T under the same terms and conditions as AT&T provides
UNTW Access Terminals to Neutral Tandem.

4Q07 STD ICA – 12/18/07
Prior to connecting the Requesting Party’s service on a pair previously used by the Provisioning
Party, the Requesting Party is responsible for ensuring the customer is no longer using the
Provisioning Party’s service or another CLEC’s service before accessing UNTW pairs.
2.8.3.3.6 Access Terminal installation intervals will be established on an individual case basis.
2.8.3.3.7 The Requesting Party is responsible for obtaining the property owner’s permission for the
Provisioning Party to install an Access Terminal(s) on behalf of the Requesting Party. The
submission of the SI by the Requesting Party will serve as certification by the Requesting Party that
such permission has been obtained. If the property owner objects to Access Terminal installations
that are in progress or within thirty (30) days after completion and demands removal of Access
Terminals, the Requesting Party will be responsible for costs associated with removing Access
Terminals and restoring the property to its original state prior to Access Terminals being installed.
2.8.3.3.8 The Requesting Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the Provisioning Party against any claims
of any kind that may arise out of the Requesting Party’s failure to obtain the property owner’s
permission. The Requesting Party will be billed for nonrecurring and recurring charges for
accessing UNTW pairs at the time the Requesting Party activates the pair(s). The Requesting
Party will notify the Provisioning Party within five (5) business days of activating UNTW pairs using
the LSR form.
2.8.3.3.9 If a trouble exists on a UNTW pair, the Requesting Party may use an alternate spare pair that
serves that customer if a spare pair is available. In such cases, the Requesting Party will re-
terminate its existing jumper from the defective pair to the spare pair. Alternatively, the Requesting
Party will isolate and report troubles in the manner specified by the Provisioning Party. The
Requesting Party must tag the UNTW pair that requires repair. If the Provisioning Party dispatches
a technician on a reported trouble call and no UNTW trouble is found, the Provisioning Party will
charge Requesting Party for time spent on the dispatch and testing the UNTW pair(s).
2.8.3.3.10 If the Requesting Party initiates the Access Terminal installation and the Requesting Party has not
activated at least ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the Access Terminal installed pursuant to the
Requesting Party’s request for an Access Terminal within six (6) months of installation of the
Access Terminal, the Provisioning Party will bill the Requesting Party a nonrecurring charge equal
to the actual cost of provisioning the Access Terminal.
2.8.3.3.11 If the Provisioning Party determines that the Requesting Party is using the UNTW pairs without
reporting the activation of the pairs, the Requesting Party will be billed for the use of that pair back
to the date the customer began receiving service from the Requesting Party at that location. Upon
request, the Requesting Party will provide copies of its billing record to substantiate such date. If
the Requesting Party fails to provide such records, then the Provisioning Party will bill the
Requesting Party back to the date of the Access Terminal installation.

2.9 Loop Makeup
2.9.1 Description of Service
2.9.1.1 AT&T shall make available to Neutral Tandem LMU information with respect to Loops that are
required to be unbundled under this Agreement so that Neutral Tandem can make an independent
judgment about whether the Loop is capable of supporting the advanced services equipment
Neutral Tandem intends to install and the services Neutral Tandem wishes to provide. LMU is a
preordering transaction, distinct from Neutral Tandem ordering any other service(s). Loop Makeup
Service Inquiries (LMUSI) and mechanized LMU queries for preordering LMU are likewise unique
from other preordering functions with associated SIs as described in this Agreement.
2.9.1.2 AT&T will provide Neutral Tandem LMU information consisting of the composition of the Loop
material (copper/fiber); the existence, location and type of equipment on the Loop, including but not
limited to digital loop carrier or other remote concentration devices, feeder/distribution interfaces,
bridged taps, load coils, pair-gain devices; the Loop length; the wire gauge and electrical
parameters.
2.9.1.3 AT&T’s LMU information is provided to Neutral Tandem as it exists either in AT&T’s databases or in
its hard copy facility records. AT&T does not guarantee accuracy or reliability of the LMU
information provided.
2.9.1.4 AT&T’s provisioning of LMU information to the requesting CLEC for facilities is contingent upon
either AT&T or the requesting CLEC controlling the Loop(s) that serve the service location for which
LMU information has been requested by the CLEC. The requesting CLEC is not authorized to
receive LMU information on a facility used or controlled by another CLEC unless AT&T receives a
LOA from the voice CLEC (owner) or its authorized agent on the LMUSI submitted by the
requesting CLEC.
2.9.1.5 Neutral Tandem may choose to use equipment that it deems will enable it to provide a certain type
and level of service over a particular AT&T Loop as long as that equipment does not disrupt other
services on the AT&T network. The determination shall be made solely by Neutral Tandem and
AT&T shall not be liable in any way for the performance of the advanced data services provisioned
over said Loop. The specific Loop type (e.g., ADSL, HDSL, or otherwise) ordered on the LSR must
match the LMU of the Loop reserved taking into consideration any requisite line conditioning. The
LMU data is provided for informational purposes only and does not guarantee Neutral Tandem’s
ability to provide advanced data services over the ordered Loop type. Furthermore, the LMU
information for Loops other than copper-only Loops (e.g., ADSL, UCL-ND, etc.) that support xDSL
services, is subject to change at any time due to modifications and/or upgrades to AT&T’s network.
Except as set forth in Section 2.9.1.6 below, copper-only Loops will not be subject to change due to
modification and/or upgrades to AT&T’s network and will remain on copper facilities until the Loop is
disconnected by Neutral Tandem or the customer, or until AT&T retires the copper facilities via the
FCC’s and any applicable Commission’s requirements. Neutral Tandem is fully responsible for any
of its service configurations that may differ from AT&T’s technical standard for the Loop type
ordered.

2.9.1.6 If AT&T retires its copper facilities using 47 C.F.R 51.325(a) requirements; or is required by a
governmental agency or regulatory body to move or replace copper facilities as a maintenance
procedure, AT&T will notify Neutral Tandem, according to the applicable network disclosure
requirements. It will be Neutral Tandem’s responsibility to move any service it may provide over
such facilities to alternative facilities. If Neutral Tandem fails to move the service to alternative
facilities by the date in the network disclosure notice, AT&T may terminate the service to complete
the network change.
2.9.2 Submitting LMUSI
2.9.2.1 Neutral Tandem may obtain LMU information and reserve facilities by submitting a mechanized
LMU query or a manual LMUSI according to the terms and conditions as described in the LMU
CLEC Information Package, incorporated herein by reference as it may be amended from time to
time. The CLEC Information Package is located at the “CLEC UNE Product” on AT&T’s Wholesale
–Southeast Region Web site. After obtaining the Loop information from the mechanized LMU
process, if Neutral Tandem needs further Loop information in order to determine Loop service
capability, Neutral Tandem may initiate a separate Manual SI for a separate nonrecurring charge as
set forth in Exhibit A.
2.9.2.2 All LSRs issued for reserved facilities shall reference the facility reservation number as provided by
AT&T. Neutral Tandem will not be billed any additional LMU charges for the Loop ordered on such
LSR. If, however, Neutral Tandem does not reserve facilities upon an initial LMUSI, Neutral
Tandem’s placement of an order for an advanced data service type facility will incur the appropriate
billing charges to include SI and reservation per Exhibit A.
2.9.2.3 Where Neutral Tandem has reserved multiple Loop facilities on a single reservation, Neutral
Tandem may not specify which facility shall be provisioned when submitting the LSR. For those
occasions, AT&T will assign to Neutral Tandem, subject to availability, a facility that meets the
AT&T technical standards of the AT&T type Loop as ordered by Neutral Tandem.
2.9.2.4 Charges for preordering manual LMUSI or mechanized LMU are separate from any charges
associated with ordering other services from AT&T.
3 Line Splitting

intrastate Access Services Tariff or BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff.
4.6 For two-way trunk groups that carry only both Parties’ Local Traffic, the Parties shall be
compensated at fifty percent (50%) of the nonrecurring and recurring rates for dedicated trunks and
DS1 facilities. Neutral Tandem shall be responsible for ordering and paying for any two-way trunks
carrying Transit Traffic.
4.7 All trunk groups will be provisioned as SS7 capable where technically feasible. If SS7 is not
technically feasible, multi-frequency (MF) protocol signaling shall be used.
4.8 In cases where Neutral Tandem is also an IXC, the IXC’s Feature Group D (FG D) trunk group(s)
must remain separate from the local interconnection trunk group(s).
4.9 Each Party shall order interconnection trunks and trunk group including trunk and trunk group
augmentations via the Access Service Request (ASR) process. A Firm Order Confirmation (FOC)
shall be returned to the ordering Party, after receipt of a valid, error free ASR, within the timeframes
set forth in each state’s applicable Performance Measures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, blocking
situations and projects shall be managed through AT&T’s Carrier Interconnection Switching Center
(CISC) Project Management Group and Neutral Tandem’s equivalent trunking group, and FOCs for
such orders shall be returned in the timeframes applicable to the project. A project is defined as (1)
a new trunk group or (2) a request for more than one hundred ninety-two (192) trunks on a single
or multiple group(s) in a given AT&T local calling area.
4.10 Interconnection Trunk Groups for Exchange of Local Traffic and Transit Traffic
4.10.1 Upon mutual agreement of the Parties in a joint planning meeting, the Parties shall exchange Local
Traffic on two-way interconnection trunk group(s) with the quantity of trunks being mutually
determined and the provisioning being jointly coordinated. Furthermore, the Parties shall agree
upon the IP(s) for two-way interconnection trunk groups transporting both Parties’ Local Traffic,
ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic. Neutral Tandem shall order such two-way trunks via
the ASR process. AT&T will use the Trunk Group Service Request (TGSR) to request changes in
trunking. Furthermore, the Parties shall jointly review trunk performance and forecasts in
accordance with Section 6 below. The Parties’ use of two-way interconnection trunk groups for the

transport of Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic between the Parties does
not preclude either Party from establishing additional one-way interconnection trunks for the
delivery of its originated Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic to the other
Party. Other trunk groups for operator services, directory assistance and intercept must be
established pursuant to AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC No. 1
Tariff.
4.10.2 AT&T Access Tandem Interconnection. AT&T Access Tandem interconnection at a single Access
Tandem provides access to those End Offices subtending that access tandem (Intratandem
Access). Access Tandem interconnection is available for any of the following access tandem
architectures:
4.10.2.1 Basic Architecture. In the basic architecture, Neutral Tandem’s originating Local Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic and originating and terminating Transit Traffic is transported on a
single two-way trunk group between Neutral Tandem and AT&T Access Tandem(s) within a LATA
to provide Intratandem Access. This trunk group carries Transit Traffic between Neutral Tandem
and ICOs, IXCs, other CLECs, CMRS providers that have a Meet Point Billing arrangement with
AT&T, and other network providers with which Neutral Tandem desires to exchange traffic. This
trunk group also carries Neutral Tandem originated Transit Traffic transiting a single AT&T Access
Tandem destined to third party tandems such as an ICO tandem or other CLEC tandem. AT&T
originated Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic is transported on a separate
single one-way trunk group terminating to Neutral Tandem. The LERG contains current routing and
tandem serving arrangements. The basic Architecture is illustrated in Exhibit B.
4.10.2.2 One-Way Trunk Group Architecture. In one-way trunk group architecture, the Parties interconnect
using three (3) separate trunk groups. A one-way trunk group provides Intratandem Access for
Neutral Tandem-originated Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic destined for
AT&T end users. A second one-way trunk group carries AT&T-originated Local Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic destined for Neutral Tandem end users. A two-way trunk group
provides Intratandem Access for Neutral Tandem’s originating and terminating Transit Traffic. This
trunk group carries Transit Traffic between Neutral Tandem and ICOs, IXCs, other CLECs, CMRS
providers that have a Meet Point Billing arrangement with AT&T, and other network providers with
which Neutral Tandem exchanges traffic. This trunk group also carries Neutral Tandem originated
Transit Traffic transiting a single AT&T Access Tandem destined to third party tandems such as an
ICO tandem or other CLEC tandem. AT&T originated Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and
IntraLATA Toll Traffic is transported on a separate single one-way trunk group terminating to
Neutral Tandem. The LERG contains current routing and tandem serving arrangements. The one-
way trunk group architecture is illustrated in Exhibit C.
4.10.2.3 Two-Way Trunk Group Architecture. The two-way trunk group Architecture establishes one (1)
two-way trunk group to provide Intratandem Access for the exchange of Local Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic between Neutral Tandem and AT&T. In addition, a separate
two-way transit trunk group must be established for Neutral Tandem’s originating and terminating
Transit Traffic. This trunk group carries Transit Traffic between Neutral Tandem and ICOs, IXCs,
other CLECs, CMRS providers that have a Meet Point Billing arrangement with AT&T, and other
network providers with which Neutral Tandem exchanges traffic. This trunk group also carries
Neutral Tandem originated Transit Traffic transiting a single AT&T Access Tandem destined to third
party tandems such as an ICO tandem or other CLEC tandem. AT&T originated traffic may, in

order to prevent or remedy traffic blocking situations, be transported on a separate single one-way
trunk group terminating to Neutral Tandem. However, where Neutral Tandem is responsive in a
timely manner to AT&T’s transport needs for its originated traffic, AT&T originating traffic will be
placed on the two-way Local Traffic trunk group carrying ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll
Traffic. The LERG contains current routing and tandem serving arrangements. The two-way trunk
group architecture is illustrated in Exhibit D.
4.10.2.4 Supergroup Architecture. In the supergroup architecture, the Parties’ Local Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic and Neutral Tandem’s Transit Traffic are exchanged on a single
two-way trunk group between Neutral Tandem and AT&T to provide Intratandem Access to Neutral
Tandem. This trunk group carries Transit Traffic between Neutral Tandem and ICOs, IXCs, other
CLECs, CMRS providers that have a Meet Point Billing arrangement with AT&T, and other network
providers with which Neutral Tandem desires to exchange traffic. This trunk group also carries
Neutral Tandem originated Transit Traffic transiting a single AT&T Access Tandem destined to third
party tandems such as an ICO tandem or other CLEC tandem. AT&T originated traffic may, in
order to prevent or remedy traffic blocking situations, be transported on a separate single one-way
trunk group terminating to Neutral Tandem. However, where Neutral Tandem is responsive in a
timely manner to AT&T’s transport needs for its originated traffic, AT&T originating traffic will be
placed on the Supergroup. Other trunk groups for operator services, directory assistance,
emergency services and intercept must be established pursuant to the applicable AT&T tariff if
service is requested. The LERG contains current routing and tandem serving arrangements. The
supergroup architecture is illustrated in Exhibit E.
4.10.2.5 Multiple Tandem Access (MTA) Interconnection
4.10.2.5.1 Where Neutral Tandem does not choose access tandem interconnection at every AT&T Access
Tandem within a LATA, Neutral Tandem must utilize AT&T’s MTA interconnection. To utilize MTA
Neutral Tandem must establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at a minimum of one (1) AT&T
Access Tandem within each LATA as required. AT&T will route Neutral Tandem’s originated Local
Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic for LATA wide transport and termination.
Neutral Tandem must also establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at all AT&T Access
Tandems where Neutral Tandem NXXs are homed as described in Section 4.2.1 above. If Neutral
Tandem does not have NXXs homed at any particular AT&T Access Tandem within a LATA and
elects not to establish an interconnection trunk group(s) at such AT&T Access Tandem, Neutral
Tandem can order MTA in each AT&T Access Tandem within the LATA where it does have an
interconnection trunk group(s) and AT&T will terminate Neutral Tandem’s Local Traffic, ISP-Bound
Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic to end users served through those AT&T Access Tandems where
Neutral Tandem does not have an interconnection trunk group(s). MTA shall be provisioned in
accordance with AT&T’s Ordering Guidelines.
4.10.2.5.2 Neutral Tandem may also utilize MTA to route its originated Transit Traffic; provided, however, that
MTA may not be utilized to route switched access traffic that transits the AT&T network to an IXC.
Switched access traffic originated by or terminated to Neutral Tandem will be delivered to and from
IXCs based on Neutral Tandem’s NXX access tandem homing arrangement as specified by Neutral
Tandem in the LERG.
4.10.2.5.3 Compensation for MTA shall be at the applicable tandem switching and transport charges specified
in Exhibit A and shall be billed in addition to any Call Transport and Termination charges.

4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
4.10.2.5.4 To the extent Neutral Tandem does not purchase MTA in a LATA served by multiple Access
Tandems, Neutral Tandem must establish an interconnection trunk group(s) to every Access
Tandem in the LATA to serve the entire LATA. To the extent Neutral Tandem routes its traffic in
such a way that utilizes AT&T’s MTA service without properly ordering MTA, Neutral Tandem shall
pay AT&T the associated MTA charges.
4.10.3 Local Tandem Interconnection
4.10.3.1 Local Tandem Interconnection arrangement allows Neutral Tandem to establish an interconnection
trunk group(s) at AT&T local tandems for: (1) the delivery of Neutral Tandem-originated Local
Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic transported and terminated by AT&T to AT&T End Offices served by
those AT&T local tandems, and (2) for local Transit Traffic transported by AT&T for third party
network providers who have also established an interconnection trunk group(s) at those AT&T local
tandems.
4.10.3.2 When a specified local calling area is served by more than one (1) AT&T local tandem, Neutral
Tandem must designate a “home” local tandem for each of its assigned NPA/NXXs and establish
trunk connections to such local tandems. Additionally, Neutral Tandem may choose to establish an
interconnection trunk group(s) at the AT&T local tandems where it has no codes homing but is not
required to do so. Neutral Tandem may deliver Local Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic to a “home”
AT&T local tandem that is destined for other AT&T or third party network provider end offices
subtending other AT&T local tandems in the same local calling area where Neutral Tandem does
not choose to establish an interconnection trunk group(s). It is Neutral Tandem’s responsibility to
enter its own NPA/NXX local tandem homing arrangements into the LERG either directly or via a
vendor in order for other third party network providers to determine appropriate traffic routing to
Neutral Tandem’s codes. Likewise, Neutral Tandem shall obtain its routing information from the
LERG.
4.10.3.3 Notwithstanding establishing an interconnection trunk group(s) to AT&T’s local tandems, Neutral
Tandem must also establish an interconnection trunk group(s) to AT&T Access Tandems within the
LATA on which Neutral Tandem has NPA/NXXs homed for the delivery of Interexchange Carrier
Switched Access and toll traffic, and traffic to Type 2A CMRS connections located at the Access
Tandems. AT&T shall not switch SWA traffic through more than one AT&T access tandem. SWA,
Type 2A CMRS or toll traffic routed to the local tandem in error will not be backhauled to the AT&T
Access Tandem for completion. (Type 2A CMRS interconnection is defined in Section A35 of
AT&T’s GSST).
4.10.3.4 AT&T’s provisioning of Local Tandem Interconnection assumes that Neutral Tandem has executed
the necessary local interconnection agreements with the other third party network providers
subtending those local tandems as required by the Act.
4.10.4 Direct End Office-to-End Office Interconnection
4.10.4.1 Direct End Office-to-End Office one-way or two-way interconnection trunk groups allow for the
delivery of a Party’s originating Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and IntraLATA Toll Traffic to the
terminating Party on a direct end office-to-end office basis.

4.10.4.2 The Parties shall utilize direct end office-to-end office trunk groups under any one (1) of the
following conditions:
4.10.4.2.1 Tandem Exhaust. If a tandem through which the Parties are interconnected is unable to, or is
forecasted to be unable to support additional traffic loads for any period of time, the Parties will
mutually agree on an end office trunking plan that will alleviate the tandem capacity shortage and
ensure completion of traffic between Neutral Tandem and AT&T.
4.10.4.2.2 Traffic Volume. To the extent either Party has the capability to measure the amount of traffic
between Neutral Tandem’s switch and an AT&T End Office and where such traffic exceeds or is
forecasted to exceed a single DS1 of traffic per month, then the Parties shall install and retain direct
end office trunking sufficient to handle such traffic volumes. Either Party will install additional
capacity between such points when overflow traffic exceeds or is forecasted to exceed a single
DS1 of traffic per month. In the case of one-way trunking, additional trunking shall only be required
by the Party whose trunking has achieved the preceding usage threshold.
4.10.4.2.3 Mutual Agreement. The Parties may install direct end office trunking upon mutual agreement in the
absence of conditions (1) or (2) above.
4.10.5 Transit Traffic Trunk Group
4.10.5.1 Transit Traffic trunks can either be two-way trunks or two (2) one-way trunks ordered by Neutral
Tandem to deliver and receive Transit Traffic. Establishing Transit Traffic trunks at AT&T Access
and Local Tandems provides Intratandem Access to the third parties also interconnected at those
tandems. Neutral Tandem shall be responsible for all recurring and nonrecurring charges
associated with Transit Traffic trunks and facilities.
4.10.5.2 Toll Free Traffic
4.10.5.2.1 If Neutral Tandem chooses AT&T to perform the Service Switching Point (SSP) Function (i.e.,
handle Toll Free database queries) from AT&T’s switches, all Neutral Tandem originating Toll Free
traffic will be routed over the Transit Traffic Trunk Group and shall be delivered using GR-394
format. Carrier Code “0110” and Circuit Code (to be determined for each LATA) shall be used for
all such calls.
4.10.5.2.2 Neutral Tandem may choose to perform its own Toll Free database queries from its switch. In such
cases, Neutral Tandem will determine the nature (local/intraLATA/interLATA) of the Toll Free call
(local/IntraLATA/InterLATA) based on the response from the database. If the call is an AT&T local
or intraLATA Toll Free call, Neutral Tandem will route the post-query local or IntraLATA converted
ten (10)-digit local number to AT&T over the local or intraLATA trunk group. If the call is a third
party (ICO, IXC, CMRS or other CLEC) local or intraLATA Toll Free call, Neutral Tandem will route
the post-query local or intraLATA converted ten (10)-digit local number to AT&T over the Transit
Traffic Trunk Group and Neutral Tandem shall provide to AT&T a Toll Free billing record when
appropriate. If the query reveals the call is an interLATA Toll Free call, Neutral Tandem will route
the post-query interLATA Toll Free call (1) directly from its switch for carriers interconnected with its
network or (2) over the Transit Traffic Trunk Group to carriers that are not directly connected to
Neutral Tandem’s network but that are connected to AT&T’s Access Tandem.

4.10.5.2.3 All post-query Toll Free calls for which Neutral Tandem performs the SSP function, if delivered to
AT&T, shall be delivered using GR-394 format for calls destined to IXCs, and GR-317 format for
calls destined to end offices that directly subtend an AT&T Access Tandem within the LATA.
5 Net ork Design And Management For Interconnection
5.1 Network Management and Changes. The Parties will exchange toll-free maintenance contact
numbers and escalation procedures. The Parties will provide public notice of network changes in
accordance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations.
5.2 Interconnection Technical Standards. The interconnection of all networks will be based upon
accepted industry/national guidelines for transmission standards and traffic blocking criteria.
Interconnecting facilities shall conform, at a minimum, to the telecommunications industry standard
of DS1 pursuant to Telcordia Standard No. GR-NWT-00499. Where Neutral Tandem chooses to
utilize SS7 signaling, also known as CCS7, SS7 connectivity is required between the Neutral
Tandem switch and the AT&T STP. AT&T will provide SS7 signaling using Common Channel
Signaling Access Capability in accordance with the technical specifications set forth in the AT&T
Guidelines to Technical Publication, GR-905-Core. Facilities of each Party shall provide the
necessary on-hook, off-hook answer and disconnect supervision and shall provide calling number
ID (Calling Party Number) when technically feasible.
5.3 Network Management Controls. Both Parties will work cooperatively to apply sound network
management principles by invoking appropriate network management controls (e.g., call gapping)
to alleviate or prevent network congestion.
6 Forecasting for Trunk Pro isioning
6.1 Within six (6) months after execution of this Agreement, Neutral Tandem shall provide an initial
interconnection trunk group forecast for each LATA in which it plans to provide service within
AT&T’s Southeast region. Upon receipt of Neutral Tandem’s forecast, the Parties shall conduct a
joint planning meeting to develop a joint interconnection trunk group forecast. Each forecast
provided under this Section shall be deemed Confidential Information under the General Terms and
Conditions.
6.1.1 At a minimum, the forecast shall include the projected quantity of Transit Trunks, Neutral Tandem-
to-AT&T one-way trunks (Neutral Tandem Trunks), AT&T-to-Neutral Tandem one-way trunks
(AT&T Trunk Groups) and/or two-way interconnection trunks, if the Parties have agreed to
interconnect using two-way trunking to transport the Parties’ Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and
IntraLATA Toll Traffic. The quantities shall be projected for a minimum of six (6) months and shall
include an estimate of the current year plus the next two (2) years total forecasted quantities. The
Parties shall mutually develop AT&T Trunk Groups and/or two-way interconnection trunk forecast
quantities.
6.1.2 All forecasts shall include, at a minimum, Access Carrier Terminal Location (ACTL), trunk group
type (e.g., local/intraLATA toll, Transit, Operator Services, 911, etc.), A location/Z location (CLLI
codes for Neutral Tandem location and AT&T location where the trunks shall terminate), interface
type (e.g., DS1), Direction of Signaling, Trunk Group Number, if known, (commonly referred to as
the 2-6 code) and forecasted trunks in service each year (cumulative).

6.2 Once initial interconnection trunk forecasts have been developed, Neutral Tandem shall continue to
provide interconnection trunk forecasts at mutually agreeable intervals. Neutral Tandem shall use
its best efforts to make the forecasts as accurate as possible based on reasonable engineering
criteria. The Parties shall continue to develop Reciprocal Trunk Group and/or two-way
interconnection trunk forecasts as described in Section 6.1.1 above.
6.3 The submission and development of interconnection trunk forecasts shall not replace the ordering
process for local interconnection trunks. Each Party shall exercise its best efforts to provide the
quantity of interconnection trunks mutually forecasted. However, the provision of the forecasted
quantity of interconnection trunks is subject to trunk terminations and facility capacity existing at the
time the trunk order is submitted. Furthermore, the receipt and development of trunk forecasts
does not imply any liability for failure to perform if capacity (trunk terminations or facilities) is not
available for use at the forecasted time.
6.4 Trunk Utilization
6.4.1 For the AT&T Trunk Groups that are Final Trunk Groups (AT&T Final Trunk Groups), AT&T and
Neutral Tandem shall monitor traffic on each AT&T Final Trunk Group that is ordered and installed.
The Parties agree that the AT&T Final Trunk Groups will be utilized at sixty percent (60%) of the
time consistent busy hour utilization level within ninety (90) days of installation. The Parties agree
that the AT&T Final Trunk Groups will be utilized at eighty percent (80%) of the time consistent
busy hour utilization level within one hundred eighty (180) days of installation. Any AT&T Final
Trunk Group not meeting the minimum thresholds set forth in this Section are defined as “under-
utilized” trunks. Subject to Section 6.4.2 below, AT&T may disconnect any under-utilized AT&T
Final Trunk Groups and Neutral Tandem shall refund to AT&T the associated nonrecurring and
recurring trunk and facility charges paid by AT&T, if any.
6.4.2 AT&T’s CISC will notify Neutral Tandem of any under-utilized AT&T Trunk Groups and the number
of such trunk groups that AT&T wishes to disconnect. AT&T will provide supporting information
either by email or facsimile to the designated Neutral Tandem interface. Neutral Tandem will
provide concurrence with the disconnection in seven (7) business days or will provide specific
information supporting why the trunks should not be disconnected. Such supporting information
should include expected traffic volumes (including traffic volumes generated due to Local Number
Portability) and the timeframes within which Neutral Tandem expects to need such trunks. AT&T’s
CISC Project Manager and Circuit Capacity Manager (CCM) will discuss the information with
Neutral Tandem to determine if agreement can be reached on the number of AT&T Final Trunk
Groups to be removed. If no agreement can be reached, AT&T will issue disconnect orders to
Neutral Tandem. The due date of these orders will be four (4) weeks after Neutral Tandem was
first notified in writing of the underutilization of the trunk groups.
6.4.3 To the extent that any interconnection trunk group is utilized at a time-consistent busy hour of
eighty percent (80%) or greater, the Parties may review the trunk groups and, if necessary, shall
negotiate in good faith for the installation of augmented facilities.
6.4.4 For the two-way trunk groups, AT&T and Neutral Tandem shall monitor traffic on each
interconnection trunk group that is ordered and installed. The Parties agree that within ninety (90)
days of the installation of the AT&T two-way trunk or trunks, the trunks will be utilized at 60 percent
(60%) of the time consistent busy hour utilization level. The Parties agree that within one hundred

eighty (180) days of the installation of a trunk or trunks, the trunks will be utilized at eighty percent
(80%) of the time consistent busy hour utilization level. Any trunk or trunks not meeting the
minimum thresholds set forth in this Section are defined as “under-utilized” trunks. AT&T will
request the disconnection of any under-utilized two-way trunk(s) and Neutral Tandem shall refund
to AT&T the associated nonrecurring and recurring trunk and facility charges paid by AT&T, if any.
6.4.4.1 AT&T’s CISC will notify Neutral Tandem of any under-utilized two-way trunk groups and the number
of trunks that AT&T wishes to disconnect. AT&T will provide supporting information either by email
or facsimile to the designated Neutral Tandem interface. Neutral Tandem will provide concurrence
with the disconnection in seven (7) business days or will provide specific information supporting
why the two-way trunks should not be disconnected. Such supporting information should include
expected traffic volumes (including traffic volumes generated due to Local Number Portability) and
the timeframes within which Neutral Tandem expects to need such trunks. AT&T’s CISC Project
Manager and CCM will discuss the information with Neutral Tandem to determine if agreement can
be reached on the number of trunks to be removed. If no agreement can be reached, Neutral
Tandem will issue disconnect orders to AT&T. The due date of these orders will be four (4) weeks
after Neutral Tandem was first notified in writing of the under-utilization of the trunk groups.
6.4.4.2 To the extent that any interconnection trunk group is utilized at a time-consistent busy hour of
eighty percent (80%) or greater, the Parties may review the trunk groups and, if necessary, shall
negotiate in good faith for the installation of augmented facilities.
7 Local Dialing Parit
7.1 AT&T and Neutral Tandem shall provide local and toll dialing parity, as defined in FCC rules and
regulations, with no unreasonable dialing delays. Dialing parity shall be provided for all originating
Telecommunications Services that require dialing to route a call.
8 Interconnection Compensation
8.1 Compensation for Call Transport and Termination for Local Traffic, ISP-Bound Traffic and
IntraLATA Toll Traffic
8.1.1 For the purposes of this Attachment and for intercarrier compensation for Local Traffic exchanged
between the Parties pursuant to this Attachment, Local Traffic is defined as any telephone call that
originates from one Party’s customer located in one exchange and terminates to the other Party’s
customer in either the same exchange, or other local calling area associated with the originating
calling party’s exchange as defined and specified in Section A3 of AT&T’s GSST.
8.1.1.1 Additionally, Local Traffic includes any cross boundary, voice-to-voice intrastate, interLATA or
interstate, interLATA calls established as a local call by the ruling regulatory body.
8.1.2 For purposes of this Attachment and for intercarrier compensation for ISP-Bound Traffic exchanged
between the Parties, ISP-Bound Traffic is defined as calls to an information service provider or
Internet Service Provider (ISP) that are dialed by using a local dialing pattern (seven (7) or ten (10)
digits) by a calling party in one (1) exchange to an ISP server or modem in either the same
exchange or other local calling area associated with the originating exchange as defined and

AT&T-9STATE/NEUTRAL TANDEM
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
specified in Section A3 of AT&T’s GSST. ISP-Bound Traffic is not Local Traffic subject to reciprocal
compensation, but instead is information access traffic subject to the FCC’s jurisdiction.
8.1.3 Notwithstanding the definitions of Local Traffic and ISP-Bound Traffic above, and pursuant to the
FCC’s Order on Remand and Report and Order in CC Docket 99-68 released April 27, 2001 (ISP
Order on Remand), AT&T and Neutral Tandem agree to the rebuttable presumption that all
combined Local and ISP-Bound Traffic that exceeds a 3:1 ratio of terminating to originating traffic
on a statewide basis shall be considered ISP-Bound Traffic for compensation purposes. AT&T and
Neutral Tandem further agree to the rebuttable presumption that all combined Local and ISP-Bound
Traffic that does not exceed a 3:1 ratio of terminating to originating traffic on a statewide basis shall
be considered Local Traffic for compensation purposes. Either Party has the right to rebut the 3:1
ISP-Bound Traffic presumption by identifying the actual ISP-Bound Traffic by any means mutually
agreed by the Parties, or by any method approved by the Commission. If a Party seeking to rebut
the presumption takes appropriate action at the Commission pursuant to Section 252 of the Act and
the Commission agrees that such Party has rebutted the presumption, the methodology and/or
means approved by the Commission for use in determining the ratio shall be utilized by the Parties
as of the date of the Commission approval and, in addition, shall be utilized to determine the
appropriate true-up as described below. During the pendency of any such proceedings to rebut the
presumption, the Parties will remain obligated to pay the reciprocal compensation rates set forth in
Section 8.1.4 for Local Traffic, and the rates set forth in Section 8.1.5 for ISP-Bound Traffic. ISP-
Bound Traffic is subject to a true-up upon the conclusion of such proceedings. Such true-up shall
be retroactive back to the date a Party first sought appropriate relief from the Commission.
8.1.4 The Parties shall compensate each other at the appropriate elemental rates set forth in Exhibit A for
the Call Transport and Termination of Local Traffic. Neutral Tandem will only be paid End Office
rate elements.
8.1.5 The Parties shall compensate each other at the composite rate of $0.0007 for the Call Transport
and Termination of ISP-Bound Traffic.
8.1.6 The appropriate elemental rates set forth in Exhibit A shall apply for Transit Traffic as described in
this Attachment and for MTA as described in this Attachment.
8.1.7 Neither Party shall represent Switched Access Traffic as Local Traffic or ISP-Bound Traffic for
purposes of determining compensation for the call. If Neutral Tandem delivers Switched Access
Traffic to AT&T for termination in violation of this Section, AT&T shall charge Neutral Tandem
terminating switched access charges as set forth in AT&T’s Intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or
BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff, as appropriate. Additionally, such delivery of traffic shall constitute
improper use of AT&T facilities as set forth in Section 1.5.2 of Attachment 7 of this Agreement.
8.1.8 IntraLATA Toll Traffic is defined as all traffic, regardless of transport protocol method, that
originates and terminates within a single LATA that is not Local Traffic or ISP-Bound traffic under
this Attachment.
8.1.8.1 For terminating its intraLATA toll traffic on the other Party’s network, the originating Party will pay
the terminating Party AT&T’s current intrastate or interstate, whichever is appropriate, terminating
switched access tariff rates as set forth in AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariffs and/or
BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff as filed and in effect with the FCC or appropriate Commission. The

appropriate charges will be determined by the routing of the call. Additionally, if one (1) Party is the
other Party’s customer’s presubscribed interexchange carrier or if one (1) Party’s customer uses
the other Party as an interexchange carrier on a 101XXXX basis, the originating party will charge
the other Party the appropriate AT&T originating switched access tariff rates as set forth in AT&T’s
intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff as filed and in effect with the
FCC or appropriate Commission.
8.1.9 If Neutral Tandem assigns NPA/NXXs to specific AT&T rate centers within the LATA and assigns
numbers from those NPA/NXXs to Neutral Tandem customer physically located outside of that
LATA, AT&T traffic originating from within the LATA where the NPA/NXXs are assigned and
delivered to a Neutral Tandem customer physically located outside of such LATA, shall not be
deemed Local Traffic. Further, Neutral Tandem agrees to identify such interLATA traffic to AT&T
and to compensate AT&T for originating and transporting such interLATA traffic to Neutral Tandem
at BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff rates.
8.2 If Neutral Tandem does not identify such interLATA traffic to AT&T, AT&T will determine which
whole Neutral Tandem NPA/NXXs on which to charge the applicable rates for originating network
access service as reflected in AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC
No. 1 Tariff. AT&T shall make appropriate billing adjustments if Neutral Tandem can provide
sufficient information for AT&T to determine whether or not said traffic is Local or ISP-Bound Traffic.
8.3 Jurisdictional Reporting
8.3.1 Percent Local Use (PLU). Each Party shall report to the other a PLU factor. The application of the
PLU will determine the amount of local or ISP-Bound minutes to be billed to the other Party. Each
Party shall update its PLU on the first of January, April, July and October of the year and shall send
it to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) days after the first of each such month
based on local and ISP-Bound usage for the past three (3) months ending the last day of
December, March, June and September, respectively. Requirements associated with PLU
calculation and reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
8.3.2 Percent Local Facility (PLF). Each Party shall report to the other a PLF factor. The application of
the PLF will determine the portion of switched dedicated transport to be billed per the local
jurisdiction rates. The PLF shall be applied to Multiplexing, Local Channel and Interoffice Channel
Switched Dedicated Transport utilized in the provision of local interconnection trunks. Each Party
shall update its PLF on the first of January, April, July and October of the year and shall send it to
the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) days after the first of each such month to be
effective the first bill period the following month, respectively. Requirements associated with PLF
calculation and reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
8.3.3 Percent Interstate Usage (PIU). Each Party shall report to the other the projected PIU factors,
including but not limited to PIU associated with facilities (PIUE) and Terminating PIU (TPIU) factors.
The application of the PIU will determine the respective interstate traffic percentages to be billed at
BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff rates. All jurisdictional report requirements, rules and regulations for
Interexchange Carriers specified in AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff will apply to Neutral
Tandem. After interstate and intrastate traffic percentages have been determined by use of PIU
procedures, the PLU and PLF factors will be used for application and billing of local traffic and
facilities. The intrastate toll traffic shall be billed at AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff rates.

Each Party shall update its PIUs on the first of January, April, July and October of the year and shall
send it to the other Party to be received no later than thirty (30) days after the first of each such
month, for all services showing the percentages of use for the past three (3) months ending the last
day of December, March, June and September. Additional requirements associated with PIU
calculations and reporting shall be as set forth in AT&T’s Jurisdictional Factors Reporting Guide.
8.3.4 Notwithstanding the provisions in Sections 8.3.1, 8.3.2, and 8.3.3 above, where AT&T has message
recording technology that identifies the jurisdiction of traffic terminated as defined in this
Agreement, such information shall, at AT&T’s option, be utilized to determine the appropriate
jurisdictional reporting factors (i.e., PLU, PIU, and/or PLF), in lieu of those provided by Neutral
Tandem. In the event that AT&T opts to utilize its own data to determine jurisdictional reporting
factors, AT&T shall notify Neutral Tandem at least fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the
calendar quarter in which AT&T will begin to utilize its own data.
8.3.5 Audits. On thirty (30) days written notice, Neutral Tandem must provide AT&T the ability and
opportunity to conduct an annual audit to ensure the proper billing of traffic. Neutral Tandem shall
retain records of call detail for a minimum of nine (9) months from which the PLU, PLF and/or PIU
can be ascertained. The audit shall be conducted during normal business hours at an office
designated by Neutral Tandem. Audit requests shall not be submitted more frequently than one (1)
time per calendar year. Audits shall be performed by an independent auditor chosen by AT&T.
The audited factor (PLF, PLU and/or PIU) shall be adjusted based upon the audit results and shall
apply to the usage for the audited period through the time period when the audit is completed, to
the usage for the quarter prior to the audit period, and to the usage for the two (2) quarters following
the completion of the audit. If, as a result of an audit, Neutral Tandem is found to have overstated
the PLF, PLU and/or PIU by twenty percentage points (20%) or more, Neutral Tandem shall
reimburse AT&T for the cost of the audit.
8.4 Compensation for IntraLATA 8XX Traffic. Neutral Tandem shall pay the appropriate switched
access charges set forth in the AT&T’s intrastate Access Services tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC No.

8.5 Mutual Provision of Switched Access Service
8.5.1 Switched Access Traffic. Switched Access Traffic is described as telephone calls requiring local
transmission or switching services for the purpose of the origination or termination of Telephone
Toll Service. Switched Access Traffic includes, but is not limited to, the following types of traffic:
Feature Group A, Feature Group B, Feature Group C, Feature Group D, toll free access (e.g.,
8XX), 900 access and their successors. Additionally, any PSTN interexchange
telecommunications traffic, regardless of transport protocol method, where the originating and
terminating points, end-to-end points, are in different LATAs, or are in the same LATA and the
Parties’ Switched Access services are used for the origination or termination of the call, shall be
considered Switched Access Traffic. Irrespective of transport protocol method or method of
originating or terminating the call, a call that originates in one LATA and terminates in another LATA
(i.e., the end-to-end points of the call) or a call in which the Parties’ Switched Access Services are
used for the origination or termination of the call, shall be considered Switched Access Traffic.
8.5.2 If an AT&T end user chooses Neutral Tandem as their presubscribed interexchange carrier, or if an
AT&T end user uses Neutral Tandem as an interexchange carrier on a 101XXXX basis, AT&T will
charge Neutral Tandem the appropriate AT&T tariff charges for originating switched access
services.
8.5.3 Where the originating Party delivers a call to the terminating Party over switched access facilities,
the originating Party will pay the terminating Party terminating, switched access charges as set forth
in AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff, as appropriate.
8.5.4 When Neutral Tandem’s end office switch provides an access service connection to or from an IXC
by a direct trunk group to the IXC utilizing AT&T facilities, each Party will provide its own access
services to the IXC and bill on a multi-bill, multi-tariff meet-point basis. Each Party will bill its own
access services rates to the IXC with the exception of the interconnection charge. The
interconnection charge will be billed by Neutral Tandem as the Party providing the end office
function. Each party will use the Multiple Exchange Carrier Access Billing (MECAB) guidelines to
establish Meet Point Billing for all applicable traffic. The Parties shall utilize a thirty (30) day billing
period.
8.5.4.1 Neutral Tandem must have a unique hosted Revenue Accounting Office (RAO) code where Neutral
Tandem’s end office subtends the AT&T Access Tandem switch for receipt or delivery of switched
access traffic and provides an access service connection to or from an IXC via AT&T’s Access
Tandem switch, AT&T, as the tandem company agrees to provide to Neutral Tandem, as the End
Office Company, as defined in MECAB, at no charge, all the switched access detail usage data,
recorded at the access tandem, within no more than sixty (60) days after the recording date. Each
Party will notify the other when it is not feasible to meet these requirements. As business
requirements change, data reporting requirements may be modified as necessary.
8.5.5 AT&T, as the tandem provider company, will retain for a minimum period of sixty (60) days, access
message detail sufficient to recreate any data that is lost or damaged by the tandem provider
company or any third party involved in processing or transporting data.
8.5.6 Neutral Tandem shall not deliver switched access traffic to AT&T for termination over any trunks
and facilities other than Neutral Tandem ordered switched access trunks and facilities.

8.6 Transit Traffic
8.6.1 AT&T shall provide tandem switching and transport services for Neutral Tandem’s Transit Traffic.
Rates for local Transit Traffic and ISP-Bound Transit Traffic shall be the applicable rate elements
for Tandem Switching, Common Transport and Tandem Intermediary Charge as set forth in Exhibit
A.Rates for Switched Access Transit Traffic shall be the applicable charges as set forth in AT&T’s
intrastate Access Services Tariff and/or BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff. Billing associated with all
Transit Traffic shall be pursuant to MECAB guidelines. Traffic between Neutral Tandem and
Wireless Type 1 third parties or Wireless Type 2A third parties that do not engage in Meet Point
Billing with AT&T shall not be treated as Transit Traffic from a routing or billing perspective until
such time as such traffic is identifiable as Transit Traffic.
8.6.2 The delivery of traffic that transits the AT&T network is excluded from any AT&T billing guarantees.
AT&T agrees to deliver Transit Traffic to the terminating carrier; provided, however, that Neutral
Tandem is solely responsible for negotiating and executing any appropriate contractual agreements
with the terminating carrier for the exchange of Transit Traffic through the AT&T network. AT&T will
not be liable for any compensation to the terminating carrier or to Neutral Tandem. In the event that
the terminating third party carrier imposes on AT&T any charges or costs for the delivery of Transit
Traffic, Neutral Tandem shall reimburse AT&T for such charges or costs.
8.7 For purposes of intercarrier compensation, AT&T will not be responsible for any compensation
associated with the exchange of traffic between Neutral Tandem and a CLEC utilizing AT&T
switching. Where technically feasible, AT&T will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
records to Neutral Tandem to identify those CLECs utilizing AT&T switching with whom Neutral
Tandem has exchanged traffic. Such traffic shall not be considered Transit Traffic from a routing or
billingperspective, but instead will be considered as traffic exchanged solely between Neutral
Tandem and the CLEC utilizing AT&T switching.
8.7.1 Neutral Tandem is solely responsible for negotiating and executing any appropriate contractual
agreements with the terminating carrier for the exchange of traffic with a CLEC utilizing AT&T
switching. AT&T will not be liable for any compensation to the terminating carrier or to Neutral
Tandem. In the event that the terminating third party carrier imposes on AT&T any charges or
costs for the delivery of such traffic, Neutral Tandem shall reimburse AT&T for all such charges or
costs.
8.8 Neutral Tandem shall send all IntraLATA toll traffic to be terminated by an independent telephone
company to the End User’s IntraLATA toll provider and shall not send such traffic to AT&T as
Transit Traffic. IntraLATA toll traffic shall be any traffic that originates outside of the terminating
independent telephone company’s local calling area.
9 Ordering Charges
9.1 The facilities purchased pursuant to this Attachment shall be ordered via the ASR process.
9.2 The rates, terms and conditions associated with submission and processing of ASRs are as set
forth in BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff, Section 5.

municipality that subscribes to Basic 911 service. The list will also provide, if known, the E911
conversion date for each municipality and, for network routing purposes, a ten (10) digit directory
number representing the appropriate emergency answering position for each municipality
subscribing to 911. Neutral Tandem will be required to arrange to accept 911 calls from its end
users in municipalities that subscribe to Basic 911 service and translate the 911 call to the
appropriate ten (10) digit directory number as stated on the list provided by AT&T. Neutral Tandem
will be required to route that call to the appropriate PSAP. When a municipality converts to E911
service, Neutral Tandem will be required to begin using E911 procedures.
10.3 E911 Interconnection. Neutral Tandem shall install a minimum of two (2) dedicated trunks
originating from its SWC and terminating to the appropriate E911 tandem. The SWC must be in the
same LATA as the E911 tandem. The dedicated trunks shall be, at a minimum, DS0 level trunks
configured as part of a digital (one point five forty-four (1.544) Mb/s) interface (DS1 facility). The
configuration shall use CAMA-type signaling with MF pulsing or SS7/ISUP signaling either of which
shall deliver ANI with the voice portion of the call. If SS7/ISUP connectivity is used, Neutral
Tandem shall follow the procedures as set forth in Appendix A of the CLEC Users Guide to E911
for Facility Based Providers that is located on the AT&T Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. If
the user interface is digital, MF pulses as well as other AC signals shall be encoded per the u-255

shall be responsible, at Neutral Tandem’s sole expense, for filing the required documentation to
obtain any and all necessary permits and/or licenses for an Adjacent Arrangement. AT&T shall
allow Shared Caged Collocation within an Adjacent Arrangement, pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in Section 3.3 above.
3.5 Direct Connect
3.5.1 AT&T will permit Neutral Tandem to directly interconnect between its own physical/virtual
Collocation Spaces within the same AT&T Premises (Direct Connect). Neutral Tandem shall
contract with an AT&T Certified Supplier to place the Direct Connect, which shall be provisioned
using facilities owned by Neutral Tandem. A Direct Connect shall utilize AT&T common cable
support structure. There will be a recurring charge per linear foot, per cable, of the actual common
cable support structure used by Neutral Tandem to provision the Direct Connect between its
physical/virtual Collocation Spaces. In those instances where Neutral Tandem’s physical/virtual
Collocation Spaces are contiguous in the central office, Neutral Tandem will have the option of
using Neutral Tandem’s own technicians to deploy the Direct Connect using either electrical or
optical facilities between its Collocation Spaces by constructing its own dedicated cable support
structure. Neutral Tandem will deploy such electrical or optical connections directly between its
own equipment without being routed through AT&T’s equipment or common cable support
structure. Neutral Tandem may not self-provision a Direct Connect on any AT&T distribution
frame, Point of Termination (POT) Bay, Digital System Cross-Connect (DSX) panel or Light Guide
Cross-Connect (LGX) panel. Neutral Tandem is solely responsible for ensuring the integrity of the
signal.
3.5.2 To place an order for a Direct Connect, Neutral Tandem must submit an Initial Application or
Subsequent Application to AT&T. If no modification to the Collocation Space is requested other
than the placement of a Direct Connect, the Co-Carrier Cross Connect/Direct Connect Application
Fee for Direct Connect, as defined in Exhibit B, will apply. If other modifications are requested, in
addition to the placement of a Direct Connect, either an Initial Application Fee or a Subsequent
Application Fee will apply, pursuant to Section 6.2 below. AT&T will bill this nonrecurring charge
on the date that AT&T provides an Application Response to Neutral Tandem.

feasible, AT&T will permit Neutral Tandem to interconnect between its Collocation Space(s) and
the physical/virtual collocation space(s) of another collocated telecommunications carrier(s) within
the same AT&T Premises via a CCXC, pursuant to the FCC’s Rules. The other collocated
telecommunications carrier’s agreement must also contain CCXC rates, terms and conditions
before AT&T will permit the provisioning of a CCXC between the two (2) collocated carriers. The
applicable AT&T charges will be assessed to Neutral Tandem upon Neutral Tandem’s request for
the CCXC. Neutral Tandem is prohibited from using the Collocation Space for the sole or primary
purpose of cross-connecting to other collocated telecommunications carriers.
3.6.2 Neutral Tandem must contract with an AT&T Certified Supplier to place the CCXC. The CCXC
shall be provisioned using facilities owned by Neutral Tandem. Such cross-connections to other
collocated telecommunications carriers may be made using either electrical or optical facilities.
Neutral Tandem shall be responsible for providing a LOA, with the application, to AT&T from the
other collocated telecommunications carrier to which it will be cross-connecting. The CCXC shall
utilize AT&T common cable support structure. There will be a recurring charge per linear foot, per
cable, of the common cable support structure used by Neutral Tandem to provision the CCXC to
the other collocated telecommunications carrier. In those instances where Neutral Tandem’s
equipment and the equipment of the other collocated telecommunications carrier are located in
contiguous caged Collocation Space, Neutral Tandem may use its own technicians to install the
CCXC using either electrical or optical facilities between the equipment of both collocated
telecommunications carriers by constructing a dedicated cable support structure between the two
(2)contiguous cages. Neutral Tandem shall deploy such electrical or optical cross-connections
directly between its own equipment and the equipment of the other collocated telecommunications
carrier without being routed through AT&T’s equipment or, in the case of a CCXC provisioned
between contiguous collocation spaces, common cable support structure. Neutral Tandem shall
not provision CCXC on any AT&T distribution frame, POT Bay, DSX panel or LGX panel. Neutral
Tandem is solely responsible for ensuring the integrity of the signal.
3.6.3 To place an order for a CCXC, Neutral Tandem must submit an application to AT&T. If no
modification to the Collocation Space is requested other than the placement of a CCXC, the Co-
Carrier Cross Connect/Direct Connect Application Fee for a CCXC, as defined in Exhibit B, will
apply. If other modifications are requested, in addition to the placement of a CCXC, either an Initial
Application or a Subsequent Application Fee will apply, pursuant to Section 6.2 below. AT&T will
bill this nonrecurring charge on the date that it provides an Application Response to Neutral
Tandem.
4 Occupanc
4.1 Space Ready Notification. AT&T will notify Neutral Tandem in writing when the Collocation Space
is ready for occupancy (Space Ready Date).
4.2 Acceptance Walkthrough. Neutral Tandem will schedule and complete an acceptance walkthrough
of new or additional provisioned Collocation Space with AT&T within fifteen (15) days after the
Space Ready Date. AT&T will correct any identified deviations from Neutral Tandem’s original or

5 Use of Collocation Space
5.1 Equipment Type
5.1.1 AT&T shall permit the collocation and use of any equipment necessary for interconnection to
AT&T’s network and/or access to AT&T’s unbundled network elements in the provision of
Telecommunications Services, as the term “necessary” is defined by FCC 47 C.F.R. 51.323 (b).
The primary purpose and function of any equipment collocated in an AT&T Premises must be for
interconnection to AT&T’s network or access to AT&T’s unbundled network elements in the
provision of Telecommunications Services. Equipment is necessary for interconnection if an
inability to deploy that equipment would, as a practical, economical, or operational matter, preclude
the requesting carrier from obtaining interconnection with AT&T at a level equal in quality to that
which AT&T obtains within its own network or what AT&T provides to any affiliate, subsidiary, or
other party.
5.1.2 Examples of equipment that would not be considered necessary include, but are not limited to:
traditional circuit switching equipment, equipment used exclusively for call-related databases,
computer servers used exclusively for providing information services, OSS equipment used to
support collocated telecommunications carrier network operations, equipment that generates
customer orders, manages trouble tickets or inventory, or stores customer records in centralized
databases, etc. AT&T will determine upon receipt of an application if the requested equipment is
necessary based on the criteria established by the FCC. Multifunctional equipment placed on an
AT&T Premises must not place any greater relative burden on AT&T’s property than comparable
single-function equipment. AT&T reserves the right to allow the collocation of any equipment on a
nondiscriminatory basis.
5.1.3 Such equipment must, at a minimum, meet the following Telcordia Network Equipment Building
Systems (NEBS) General Equipment Requirements: for Central Offices Criteria Level 1
requirements as outlined in Telcordia Special Report SR-3580, Issue 1 and for Remote Sites
Criteria Level 3 requirements as outlined in the Telcordia Special report SR-3580, Issue 1. Except
where otherwise required by a Commission, AT&T shall comply with the applicable FCC rules
relating to denial of collocation equipment based on Neutral Tandem’s failure to comply with this
Section.
5.1.3.1 To the extent Neutral Tandem wishes to place equipment in its collocation that does not meet the
standards set forth in 5.1.3, Neutral Tandem may request in writing, pursuant to the Notices section
of the General Terms & Conditions, a waiver to such standards. AT&T may provide a waiver in its
sole discretion.
5.1.4 At a Remote Site, all Neutral Tandem equipment installation shall comply with AT&T TR 73503-
11h, “Grounding - Engineering Procedures”. Metallic cable sheaths and metallic strength members
of optical fiber cables as well as the metallic cable sheaths of all copper conductor cables shall be
bonded to the designated grounding bus for the Remote Site Location. All copper conductor pairs,
working and non-working, shall be equipped with a solid-state protector unit (over-voltage
protection only), which has been listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.

5.2 Terminations. Neutral Tandem shall not request more DS0, DS1, DS3 and/or optical terminations
for a collocation arrangement than the total port or termination capacity of the equipment physically
installed in the Collocation Space. The total capacity of the equipment collocated in the Collocation
Space will include equipment contained in an application, as well as any equipment already placed
in the Collocation Space. If full network termination capacity of the equipment being installed is not
requested in the application submitted by Neutral Tandem, additional network terminations for the
installed equipment will require the submission of a Subsequent Application. In the event Neutral
Tandem submits an application for terminations that will exceed the total capacity of the collocated
equipment, Neutral Tandem will be informed of the discrepancy by AT&T and required to submit a
revision to the application.
5.3 Security Interest in Equipment. Commencing with the most current calendar quarter after the
Effective Date of this Agreement, and thereafter with respect to each subsequent calendar quarter
during the term of this Agreement, Neutral Tandem will, no later than thirty (30) days after the close
of such calendar quarter, provide a report to ICS Collocation Product Management, Room 34th
Floor, 675 W. Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30375, listing any equipment in the Collocation
Space (i) that was added during the calendar quarter to which such report pertains, and (ii) for
which there is a UCC-1 lien holder or to another entity that has a secured financial interest in such
equipment (Secured Equipment). If no Secured Equipment has been installed within a given
calendar quarter, no report shall be due hereunder in connection with such calendar quarter.
5.4 No Marketing. Neutral Tandem shall not use the Collocation Space for marketing purposes, nor
shall it place any identifying signs or markings outside the Collocation Space or on the grounds of
the AT&T Premises.
5.5 Equipment Identification. Neutral Tandem shall place a plaque or affix other identification (e.g.,
stenciling or labeling) to each piece of Neutral Tandem’s equipment, including the appropriate
emergency contacts with their corresponding telephone numbers, in order for AT&T to properly
identify Neutral Tandem’s equipment in the case of an emergency. For caged Collocation Space,
such identification must be placed on a plaque affixed to the outside of the caged enclosure.
5.6 Entrance Facilities.
5.6.1 Neutral Tandem may elect to place Neutral Tandem-owned or Neutral Tandem leased fiber
entrance facilities into its Collocation Space. AT&T will designate the point of interconnection in
close proximity to the AT&T Premises housing the Collocation Space, such as at an entrance
manhole or a cable vault for Central Offices, which is physically accessible by both Parties. For
Central Offices, Neutral Tandem will provide and place fiber cable in the entrance manhole of
sufficient length to be pulled through conduit and into the splice location. Neutral Tandem will
provide and install a sufficient length of fire retardant riser cable, to which AT&T will splice the
entrance cable. The fire retardant riser cable will extend from the splice location to Neutral
Tandem’s equipment in Neutral Tandem’s Collocation Space. In the event Neutral Tandem utilizes
a non-metallic, riser-type entrance facility, a splice will not be required. For Remote Terminals
Neutral Tandem will provide and place copper cable through conduit from the Remote Site
Collocation Space to the feeder distribution interface. Such copper cable must be of sufficient
length to reach the splice location for splicing by AT&T. Neutral Tandem must contact AT&T for
authorization and instruction prior to placing any entrance facility cable in an entrance manhole or
cable vault. Neutral Tandem is responsible for the maintenance of the entrance facilities.
Nonrecurring charges for cable installation will be assessed on a per cable basis as set forth in
Exhibit B upon receipt of Neutral Tandem’s BFFO. Recurring charges for the cable support
structure will be billed at the rates set forth in Exhibit B.

5.6.2 Central Office Microwave Transmission Facilities. At Neutral Tandem’s request, AT&T will
accommodate, where technically feasible and space is available, a microwave entrance facility,
pursuant to separately negotiated rates, terms and conditions.
5.6.3 Central Office Copper and Coaxial Cable Entrance Facilities. In Florida and Georgia, AT&T shall
permit Neutral Tandem to use copper or coaxial cable entrance facilities, if approved by the
Commission, but only in those rare instances where Neutral Tandem demonstrates a necessity
and entrance capacity is not at or near exhaust in a particular AT&T Premises in which Neutral
Tandem’s Collocation Space is located. In Florida, Neutral Tandem must have approval by the
Commission before it submits a request for copper entrance facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of adjacent collocation, copper facilities may be used between the adjacent
collocation arrangement and the central office demarcation point, unless AT&T determines that
limited space is available for the placement of these entrance facilities.
5.7 Dual Entrance Facilities at a Central Office. AT&T will provide at least two (2) interconnection
points at each Central Office where at least two (2) such interconnection points are available and
capacity exists. Upon receipt of a request by Neutral Tandem for dual entrance facilities to its
physical Collocation Space, AT&T shall provide Neutral Tandem with information regarding AT&T’s
capacity to accommodate the requested dual entrance facilities. If conduit in the serving
manhole(s) is available and is not reserved for another purpose or for utilization within twelve (12)
months of the receipt of an application for collocation, AT&T will make the requested conduit space
available for the installation of a second entrance facility to Neutral Tandem’s Collocation Space.
The location of the serving manhole(s) will be determined at the sole discretion of AT&T. Where
dual entrance facilities are not available due to a lack of capacity, AT&T will provide this
information to Neutral Tandem in the Application Response.
5.8 Shared Use
5.8.1 Neutral Tandem may utilize spare capacity on an existing telecommunications carrier’s entrance
facility for the purpose of obtaining an entrance facility to Neutral Tandem’s Collocation Space
within the same AT&T Premises.
5.8.2 AT&T shall allow the splice, as long as the fiber is non-working dark fiber. Neutral Tandem must
arrange with AT&T in accordance with AT&T’s Special Construction Procedures, RL93-11-030BT,
and provide a LOA from the other telecommunications carrier authorizing AT&T to perform the
splice of the Neutral Tandem-provided riser cable to the spare capacity on the other
telecommunications carrier’s entrance facility. If Neutral Tandem desires to allow another
telecommunications carrier to use its entrance facilities, the telecommunications carrier must
arrange with AT&T in accordance with AT&T’s Special Construction Procedures, RL93-11-030BT,
and provide a LOA from Neutral Tandem authorizing AT&T to perform the splice of the
telecommunications carrier’s provided riser cable to the spare capacity on Neutral Tandem’s
entrance facility.
5.9 Demarcation Point
5.9.1 In Tennessee, if Neutral Tandem elects the Tennessee Regulatory Authority (TRA) rates as set

4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
to cure the violation within forty-eight (48) hours or, if such cure is not possible, to commence
curative action within twenty-four (24) hours and exercise reasonable diligence to complete such
action as soon as possible, or if the violation is of a character that poses an immediate and
substantial threat of damage to property or injury or death to any person, or any other significant
degradation, interference or impairment of AT&T’s or another entity’s service, then and only in that
event, AT&T may take such action as it deems necessary to eliminate such threat including,
without limitation, the interruption of electrical power to Neutral Tandem’s equipment and/or
facilities. AT&T will endeavor, but is not required, to provide notice to Neutral Tandem prior to the
taking of such action and AT&T shall have no liability to Neutral Tandem for any damages arising
from such action, except to the extent that such action by AT&T constitutes willful misconduct.
5.14.3 For purposes of this Section, the term “significantly degrades” shall be defined as an action that
noticeably impairs a service from a user’s perspective. In the case of the deployment of an
advanced service which significantly degrades the performance of other advanced services or
traditional voice band services and Neutral Tandem fails to cure the violation within forty-eight (48)
hours, or if such cure is not possible, to commence curative action within twenty-four (24) hours
and exercise reasonable diligence to complete such action as soon as possible, AT&T will
establish before the appropriate Commission that the technology deployed is causing the
significant degradation. Any claims of network harm presented to Neutral Tandem or, if
subsequently necessary, the Commission must be provided by AT&T with specific and verifiable
information. When AT&T demonstrates that a certain technology deployed by Neutral Tandem is
significantly degrading the performance of other advanced services or traditional voice band
services, Neutral Tandem shall discontinue deployment of that technology and migrate its
customers to other technologies that will not significantly degrade the performance of such
services. Where the only degraded service itself is a known disturber, and the newly deployed
technology satisfies at least one of the criteria for a presumption that it is acceptable for
deployment, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 51.230, the degraded service shall not prevail against the
newly-deployed technology.
5.15 Personalty and Its Removal. Facilities and equipment placed by Neutral Tandem in the Collocation
Space shall not become a part of the Collocation Space, even if nailed, screwed or otherwise
fastened to the Collocation Space, but shall retain their status as personal property and may be
removed by Neutral Tandem at any time. Any damage caused to the Collocation Space by Neutral
Tandem’s employees, suppliers, agents or Guests during the installation or removal of such
property shall be promptly repaired by Neutral Tandem at its sole expense. If Neutral Tandem
decides to remove equipment and/or facilities from its Collocation Space and the removal requires
no physical work be performed by AT&T and Neutral Tandem’s physical work includes, but is not
limited to, power reduction, cross-connects, or tie pairs, AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem the
Administrative Only Application Fee associated with the type of removal activity performed by
Neutral Tandem, as set forth in Exhibit B. This nonrecurring fee will be billed on the date that
AT&T provides an Application Response to Neutral Tandem.
5.16 Alterations. Under no condition shall Neutral Tandem or any person acting on behalf of Neutral
Tandem make any rearrangement, modification, augment, improvement, addition, and/or other
alteration which could affect in any way space, power, HVAC, and/or safety considerations to the
Collocation Space or the AT&T Premises, hereinafter referred to individually or collectively as
“Alterations”, without the express written consent of AT&T, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The cost of any such Alteration shall be paid by Neutral Tandem. An Alteration shall
require the submission of a Subsequent Application and will result in the assessment of the
applicable application fee associated with the type of alteration requested, as set forth in Sections

6.2.1 Subsequent Application Fees. The application fee paid by Neutral Tandem for an Alteration in a
Central Office shall be dependent upon the level of assessment needed to provide a complete
Application Response for the Alteration requested. Where the Subsequent Application does not
require provisioning or construction work, but requires AT&T to perform an administrative activity,
an Administrative Only Application Fee shall apply as set forth in Exhibit B. The Administrative
Only Application Fee will apply to Subsequent Applications associated with a transfer of ownership
of the Collocation Space, the addition, exchange or removal of equipment from the Collocation
Space (where the removal requires no physical work to be performed by AT&T which require no
additional space, power or terminations to be provided to Neutral Tandem’s collocation
arrangement), and a virtual-to-physical conversion (in place). The Co-Carrier Cross

appropriate nonrecurring application fee will be billed on the date that AT&T provides Neutral
Tandem with an Application Response.
6.3 Space Preferences. If Neutral Tandem has previously requested and received a Space Availability
Report for the AT&T Premises, Neutral Tandem may submit up to three (3) space preferences on
its application by identifying the specific space identification numbers referenced on the Space
Availability Report for the space it is requesting. In the event AT&T cannot accommodate Neutral
Tandem’s space preference(s), Neutral Tandem may accept the space allocated by AT&T or
cancel its application and submit another application requesting additional space preferences for
the same AT&T Premises. This application will be treated as a new application and the
appropriate application fee will apply. The application fee will be billed by AT&T on the date that
AT&T provides Neutral Tandem with an Application Response.
6.4 Space Availability Notification
6.4.1 For all states except Florida and Tennessee, AT&T will respond to an application within ten (10)
days as to whether space is available or not available within the requested AT&T Premises. In
Florida and Tennessee, AT&T will respond to an application within fifteen (15) days as to whether

when Neutral Tandem’s application is Bona Fide. If the application cannot be Bona Fide, AT&T will
identify what revisions are necessary for the application to become Bona Fide.
6.4.2 If the amount of space requested is not available, AT&T will notify Neutral Tandem of the amount
of space that is available and no application fee will apply. When AT&T’s response includes an
amount of space less than that requested by Neutral Tandem or space that is configured
differently, no application fee will apply. If Neutral Tandem decides to accept the available space,
Neutral Tandem must resubmit its application to reflect the actual space available, including the
configuration of the space, prior to submitting a BFFO. When Neutral Tandem resubmits its
application to accept the available space, AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem the appropriate application
fee.
6.5 Denial of Application. If AT&T notifies Neutral Tandem that no space is available (Denial of
Application), AT&T will not assess an application fee to Neutral Tandem. After notifying Neutral
Tandem that AT&T has no available space in the requested AT&T Premises, AT&T will allow
Neutral Tandem, upon request, to tour the entire AT&T Premises within ten (10) days of such
Denial of Application. In order to schedule this tour, AT&T must receive the request for the tour of
the AT&T Premises within five (5) days of the Denial of Application.
6.6 Petition for Waiver. Upon Denial of Application, AT&T will timely file a petition with the appropriate
Commission pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 251(c)(6). AT&T shall provide to the Commission any
information requested by that Commission. Such information shall include which space, if any,
AT&T or any of AT&T’s affiliates have reserved for future use and a detailed description of the

specific future uses for which the space has been reserved. Subject to an appropriate
nondisclosure agreement or provision, AT&T shall permit Neutral Tandem to inspect any floor
plans or diagrams that AT&T provides to the Commission.
6.7 Waiting List
6.7.1 On a first-come, first-serve basis, which is governed by the date of receipt of an application or
Letter of Intent, AT&T will maintain a waiting list of requesting telecommunications carriers that
have either received a Denial of Application or, where it is publicly known that an AT&T Premises is
out of space, have submitted a Letter of Intent to collocate in that AT&T Premises. AT&T will notify
each telecommunications carrier on the waiting list that can be accommodated by the amount of
space that becomes available, according to the position of the telecommunications carrier on said
waiting list.
6.7.2 In Florida, on a first-come, first-serve basis, which is governed by the date of receipt of an
application or Letter of Intent, AT&T will maintain a waiting list of requesting telecommunications
carriers that have either received a Denial of Application or, where it is publicly known that an
AT&T Premises is out of space, have submitted a Letter of Intent to collocate in that AT&T
Premises. Sixty (60) days prior to space becoming available, if known, AT&T will notify the
Commission and the telecommunications carriers on the waiting list by mail when space will
become available. If AT&T does not know sixty (60) days in advance of when space will become
available, AT&T will notify the Commission and the telecommunications carriers on the waiting list
within two (2) business days of the determination that space will become available. A
telecommunications carrier that, upon denial of physical Collocation Space, requests virtual
Collocation Space shall automatically be placed on the waiting list for physical Collocation Space
that may become available in the future.
6.7.3 When physical Collocation Space becomes available, Neutral Tandem must submit an updated,
complete and accurate application to AT&T within thirty (30) days of notification by AT&T that
physical Collocation Space will be available in the requested AT&T Premises previously out of
space. If Neutral Tandem has originally requested caged Collocation Space and cageless
Collocation Space becomes available, Neutral Tandem may refuse such space and notify AT&T in
writing, within the thirty (30) day timeframe referenced above, that Neutral Tandem wishes to
maintain its place on the waiting list for caged physical Collocation Space, without accepting the
available cageless Collocation Space.
6.7.4 Neutral Tandem may accept an amount of space less than what it originally requested by
submitting an application as set forth above, and upon request, may maintain its position on the
waiting list for the remaining space that was initially requested. If Neutral Tandem does not submit
an application or notify AT&T in writing within the thirty (30) day timeframe as described in Section
6.7.2 above, AT&T will offer the available space to the next telecommunications carrier on the
waiting list and remove Neutral Tandem from the waiting list. Upon request, AT&T will advise
Neutral Tandem as to its position on the waiting list for a particular AT&T Premises.
6.8 Public Notification. AT&T will maintain on its Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site, a
notification document that will indicate all AT&T Premises that are without available space. AT&T
shall update such document within ten (10) days of the date that AT&T becomes aware that
insufficient space is available to accommodate physical Collocation. AT&T will also post a
document on its Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site that contains a general notice when
space becomes available in an AT&T Premises previously on the space exhaust list.

environmental condition (e.g., temperature extremes or excess humidity) known to that Party.
7.7 Virtual to Physical Relocation. In the event physical Collocation Space was previously denied at an
AT&T Central Office due to technical reasons or space limitations and physical Collocation Space
has subsequently become available, Neutral Tandem may relocate its existing virtual Collocation
arrangement(s) to a physical Collocation arrangement(s) and pay the appropriate fees associated
with the rearrangement or reconfiguration of the services being terminated into the virtual
Collocation arrangement, as set forth in Exhibit B. If AT&T knows when additional physical
Collocation Space may become available at the AT&T Central Office requested by Neutral
Tandem, such information will be provided to Neutral Tandem in AT&T’s written denial of physical
Collocation Space. Neutral Tandem must arrange with an AT&T Certified Supplier for the
relocation of equipment from a virtual Collocation Space to a physical Collocation Space and will
bear the cost of such relocation, including the costs associated with moving the services from the
virtual Collocation Space to the new physical Collocation Space.
7.7.1 In Alabama, AT&T will complete a relocation of a virtual collocation arrangement to a cageless
physical collocation arrangement within sixty (60) days from AT&T’s receipt of a BFFO and from a

7.8 Virtual to Physical Conversion (In-Place)
7.8.1 Virtual collocation arrangements in Central Offices may be converted to “in-place” physical caged
collocation arrangements if the potential conversion meets all of the following criteria: (1) there is
no change in the amount of equipment or the configuration of the equipment that was in the virtual
Collocation Space; (2) the conversion of the virtual collocation arrangement will not cause the
equipment or the results of that conversion to be located in a space that AT&T has reserved for its
own future needs; and (3) any changes to the arrangement can be accommodated by existing
power, HVAC, and other requirements. Unless otherwise specified herein, AT&T will complete
virtual to physical Collocation Space conversions (in-place) within sixty (60) days from receipt of
the BFFO. AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem an Administrative Only Application Fee, as set forth in
Exhibit B, on the date AT&T provides an Application Response to Neutral Tandem.
7.8.2 In Alabama and Tennessee, AT&T will complete virtual to physical conversions (in place) within
thirty (30) days from receipt of the BFFO as long as the conversion meets all of the criteria
specified in Section 7.8.1 above.
7.9 Cancellation. Unless otherwise specified in this Attachment, if at any time prior to Space
Acceptance, Neutral Tandem cancels its order for Collocation Space (Cancellation), AT&T will bill
the applicable nonrecurring charge(s) for any and all work processes for which work has begun or

next scheduled monthly billing statement.
8.3 Recurring Charges
8.3.1 If Neutral Tandem has met the applicable fifteen (15) day acceptance walk through interval
specified in Section 4.2 above, billing for recurring charges will begin upon the Space Acceptance
Date. In the event Neutral Tandem fails to complete an acceptance walk through within the
applicable fifteen (15) day interval, billing for recurring charges will commence on the Space Ready
Date. If Neutral Tandem occupies the space prior to the Space Ready Date, the date Neutral
Tandem occupies the space is deemed the Space Acceptance Date and billing for recurring
charges will begin on that date. The billing for all applicable monthly recurring charges will begin in
Neutral Tandem’s next billing cycle and will include any prorated charges for the period from
Neutral Tandem’s Space Acceptance Date or Space Ready Date, whichever is appropriate
pursuant to Section 4.2 above, to the date the bill is issued by AT&T.
8.3.2 Unless otherwise stated in Section 8.9 below, monthly recurring charges for -48V DC power will be
assessed per fused ampere (amp), per month, based upon the total number of fused amps of
power capacity requested by Neutral Tandem on Neutral Tandem’s Initial Collocation Application
and all Subsequent Collocation Applications, which may either increase or decrease the originally
requested, and any subsequently augmented, number of fused amps of power capacity requested,
consistent with Commission orders.
8.3.3 AT&T shall have the right to inspect and inventory any DC power fuse installations at an AT&T
BDFB or DC power circuit installations at AT&T’s main power board for any Neutral Tandem
collocation arrangement, to verify that the total number of fused amps of power capacity installed
by Neutral Tandem’s AT&T Certified Supplier matches the number of fused amps of DC power
capacity requested by Neutral Tandem on Neutral Tandem’s Initial Application and all Subsequent
Applications. If AT&T determines that Neutral Tandem’s AT&T Certified Supplier has installed
more DC capacity than Neutral Tandem requested on its Initial Application and all Subsequent
Applications, AT&T shall notify Neutral Tandem in writing of such discrepancy and shall assess
Neutral Tandem for the additional DC power fuse/circuit capacity from the Space Acceptance Date
or Space Ready Date, whichever is applicable pursuant to Section 8.3.1 above, for the most recent
Initial Application or Subsequent Application, submitted for such collocation arrangement. AT&T
shall also revise Neutral Tandem’s recurring DC power charges, on a going-forward basis, to
reflect the higher number of fused amps of power capacity available for the collocation
arrangement.
8.4 Nonrecurring Charges. Unless specified otherwise herein, AT&T shall assess nonrecurring
charges, including all application fees, within thirty (30) days of the date that AT&T provides an
Application Response to Neutral Tandem or on Neutral Tandem’s next scheduled monthly billing
statement, if Neutral Tandem’s current month’s billing cycle has already closed. Nonrecurring
charges associated with the processing of the Firm Order for collocation space preparation (Firm
Order Processing Fee) shall be billed by AT&T within thirty (30) days of AT&T’s confirmation of
Neutral Tandem’s BFFO or on Neutral Tandem’s next scheduled monthly billing statement.
8.5 In some cases, Commissions have ordered AT&T to separate its disconnect costs and its
installation costs into two separate nonrecurring charges. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted in

Application submitted by Neutral Tandem converting its caged collocation arrangements to the
metered power rates. AT&T shall then arrange for the measurement of Neutral Tandem’s actual
power usage on each power feed (each A and B power feed) once each quarter at each of Neutral
Tandem’s caged collocation arrangements for which Neutral Tandem has submitted an Initial or
Subsequent Application electing metered power.
8.9.11.10 Based upon the actual power usage measurement taken by AT&T or the AT&T Certified Supplier,
AT&T shall assess Neutral Tandem for power usage for the following quarter based upon Neutral
Tandem’s actual metered usage for each power feed (both the A and B power feeds) or a minimum
of ten (10) amps of –48V DC power usage for the sum of the A and B feeds for each power cable,
whichever is greater. Such usage shall then be multiplied by the rate for Load Amps either with an
AT&T BDFB or with Neutral Tandem BDFB as set forth in Exhibit B of this Attachment, to
determine the appropriate monthly recurring power usage charge that will be billed to Neutral
Tandem for the following three (3) months or until the next power usage measurement is taken,
whichever is later.
8.9.11.11 Either Party, within fifteen (15) days of notice of the usage measurement established by the
scheduled meter reading, may challenge the accuracy of that reading by requesting a new reading.
If Neutral Tandem requests that an unscheduled (prior to the next scheduled quarterly power
reading date) power usage reading be taken, then Neutral Tandem will be responsible for paying
the “Additional Meter Reading Trip Charge” contained in Exhibit B of this Attachment. If AT&T
requests a power usage reading be taken in this instance, then Neutral Tandem will not be charged
the “Additional Meter Reading Trip Charge” for the unscheduled meter reading. If the readings
vary by more than ten (10) % or five (5) Amps, whichever is greater, the Parties shall work
cooperatively to reconcile such discrepancies and establish the appropriate usage figure in a
reasonable and expeditious manner. If the readings do not vary outside these ranges, the initial
reading will be used to calculate Neutral Tandem’s AC usage charge for the next three (3) months.
8.9.11.12 AT&T, at any time and at its own expense, shall have the right to verify the accuracy of Neutral
Tandem’s BDFB meter by performing its own meter reading via an alternate method, such as, but
not limited to, an ammeter. If the meter readings vary by more than ten (10) % or five (5) Amps,
whichever is greater, the Parties agree to perform a joint investigation. If Neutral Tandem’s BDFB
meter is found to be in error, then Neutral Tandem agrees to recalibrate, repair, or replace its meter
as required. The Parties recognize that the meter readings discussed in this Attachment are
instantaneous readings that can experience minor fluctuations due to usage traffic, voltage
fluctuations, and calibration of the meters themselves. The readings must vary by more than ten
(10)% or five (5) Amps, whichever is greater, before any recalibration, repair, or replacement will
be required. If the AT&T reading is substantiated, AT&T shall adjust Neutral Tandem’s billing
retroactive to the beginning of the quarter for which the last meter reading was taken.
8.9.11.13 When Neutral Tandem submits the appropriate Initial or Subsequent Application for a specific
caged collocation arrangement in a particular AT&T Premises, AT&T will provide the associated
Application Response pursuant to Section 6 above. It will then be the responsibility of Neutral
Tandem to submit a BFFO. After AT&T receives the BFFO from Neutral Tandem, the Initial or
Subsequent Application will be completed by AT&T within the provisioning intervals contained in
Section 7 above and Neutral Tandem will be notified of the Space Ready Date or when the
appropriate record and database changes have been made by AT&T to reflect Neutral Tandem’s
conversion to the metered power rates (which will be considered the “Space Ready Date” for
purposes of a Subsequent Application submitted to convert a specific caged collocation
arrangement in a particular AT&T Premises to the metered power rates).

Ready Date for any request submitted via a Subsequent Application for an existing caged
collocation arrangement. When a Subsequent Application is used to elect metered power and
there are no other changes requested, billing for the recurring charges associated with metered
power will begin upon the Space Ready Date. If Neutral Tandem occupies the space prior to the
Space Ready Date, for Initial Application requests only, the date Neutral Tandem occupies the
space will be deemed the new Space Acceptance Date and billing for metered power will begin on
that date. When Neutral Tandem moves to metered power the number of fused amps of DC Power
requested by Neutral Tandem on its Initial or Subsequent Application will be used for calculating
the number of amps to be billed until such time as AT&T or its AT&T Certified Supplier can
perform, under the currently existing quarterly meter reading schedule, a reading of Neutral
Tandem’s power usage for the requested caged Collocation Space. As soon as this reading has
been taken, AT&T will adjust Neutral Tandem’s billing accordingly to reflect the actual metered
usage back to the Space Acceptance Date. AT&T will also use this reading for billing purposes
until the next quarterly meter reading is performed by AT&T or its AT&T Certified Supplier.
8.9.11.15 Neutral Tandem agrees to submit a Subsequent Application to notify AT&T when Neutral Tandem
has removed or installed telecommunications equipment in Neutral Tandem’s physical Collocation
Space to ensure that Neutral Tandem’s existing fused DC power capacity is sufficiently engineered
to accommodate the power requirements associated with the installation of additional equipment in
Neutral Tandem’s Collocation Space. An associated change in power usage will be reflected in the
next quarterly power measurement billing cycle.
8.9.11.16 AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem a monthly recurring charge per caged Collocation Space for each
arrangement that Neutral Tandem has converted to metered power or for new caged Collocation
Spaces under the election of metered power. This “Meter Reading” monthly recurring rate element
will be assessed per circuit for each circuit read by AT&T or its AT&T Certified Supplier, at the
rates set forth in Exhibit B.
8.9.12 In Alabama and Louisiana, Neutral Tandem has the option to purchase power directly from an

11.1 AT&T may conduct an inspection of Neutral Tandem’s equipment and facilities in Neutral
Tandem’s Collocation Space(s) prior to the activation of facilities and/or services between Neutral
Tandem’s equipment and equipment of AT&T. AT&T may conduct an inspection if Neutral
Tandem adds equipment and may otherwise conduct routine inspections at reasonable intervals
mutually agreed upon by the Parties. AT&T shall provide Neutral Tandem with a minimum of
forty-eight (48) hours or two (2) business days, whichever is greater, advance notice of all such
inspections. All costs of such inspections shall be borne by AT&T.
12 Securit and Safet Requirements
12.1 Unless otherwise specified, Neutral Tandem will be required, at its own expense, to conduct a
statewide investigation of criminal history records for each Neutral Tandem employee hired in the
past five (5) years being considered for work on an AT&T Premises, for the states/counties where
the Neutral Tandem employee has worked and lived for the past five (5) years. Where state law
does not permit statewide collection or reporting, an investigation of the applicable counties is
acceptable. Neutral Tandem shall not be required to perform this investigation if an affiliated
company of Neutral Tandem has performed an investigation of the Neutral Tandem employee
seeking access, if such investigation meets the criteria set forth above. This requirement will not
apply if Neutral Tandem has performed a pre-employment statewide investigation of criminal
history records of the Neutral Tandem employee for the states/counties where the Neutral Tandem
employee has worked and lived for the past five (5) years or, where state law does not permit a
statewide investigation, an investigation of the applicable counties.
12.2 Neutral Tandem will be required to administer to its personnel assigned to the AT&T Premises
security training either provided by AT&T, or meeting criteria defined by AT&T at AT&T’s

12.3 Neutral Tandem shall provide its employees and agents with picture identification, which must be
worn and visible at all times while in Neutral Tandem’s Collocation Space or other areas in or
around the AT&T Premises. The photo identification card shall bear, at a minimum, the
employee’s name and photo and Neutral Tandem’s name. AT&T reserves the right to remove from
an AT&T Premises any employee of Neutral Tandem not possessing identification issued by
Neutral Tandem or who has violated any of AT&T’s policies as outlined in the CLEC Security
Training documents. Neutral Tandem shall hold AT&T harmless for any damages resulting from
such removal of Neutral Tandem’s personnel from an AT&T Premises. Neutral Tandem shall be
solely responsible for ensuring that any Guest(s) of Neutral Tandem is in compliance with all
subsections of this Section.
12.4 Neutral Tandem shall not assign to the AT&T Premises any personnel with records of felony
criminal convictions. Neutral Tandem shall not assign to the AT&T Premises any personnel with
records of misdemeanor convictions, except for misdemeanor traffic violations, without advising
AT&T of the nature and gravity of the offense(s). AT&T reserves the right to refuse building access
to any of Neutral Tandem’s personnel who have been identified to have misdemeanor criminal
convictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Neutral Tandem chooses not to advise
AT&T of the nature and gravity of any misdemeanor conviction, Neutral Tandem may, in the
alternative, certify to AT&T that it shall not assign to the AT&T Premises any personnel with
records of misdemeanor convictions (other than misdemeanor traffic violations).
12.4.1 Neutral Tandem shall not knowingly assign to the AT&T Premises any individual who was a former
employee of AT&T and whose employment with AT&T was terminated for a criminal offense,
whether or not AT&T sought prosecution of the individual for the criminal offense.
12.4.2 Neutral Tandem shall not knowingly assign to the AT&T Premises any individual who was a former
supplier of AT&T and whose access to an AT&T Premises was revoked due to the commission of a
criminal offense, whether or not AT&T sought prosecution of the individual for the criminal offense.
12.5 For each Neutral Tandem employee or agent hired by Neutral Tandem within the last five (5)
years, who requires access to an AT&T Premises to perform work in Neutral Tandem Collocation
Space(s), Neutral Tandem shall furnish AT&T certification that the aforementioned background
check and security training were completed. This certification must be provided to and approved
by AT&T before an employee or agent will be granted such access to an AT&T Premises. The
certification will contain a statement that no felony convictions were found and certify that the
employee completed the security training. If the employee’s criminal history includes misdemeanor
convictions, Neutral Tandem will disclose the nature of the convictions to AT&T at that time. In the
alternative, Neutral Tandem may certify to AT&T that it shall not assign to the AT&T Premises any
personnel with records of misdemeanor convictions, other than misdemeanor traffic violations.
12.5.1 For all other Neutral Tandem employees requiring access to an AT&T Premises pursuant to this
Attachment, Neutral Tandem shall furnish AT&T, prior to an employee gaining such access, a
certification that the employee is not subject to the requirements of Section 12.5 above and that
security training was completed by the employee.
12.6 At AT&T’s request, Neutral Tandem shall promptly remove from the AT&T Premises any employee
of Neutral Tandem that AT&T does not wish to grant access to an AT&T Premises: 1) pursuant to
any investigation conducted by AT&T, or 2) prior to the initiation of an investigation if an employee
of Neutral Tandem is found interfering with the property or personnel of AT&T or another collocated
telecommunications carrier, provided that an investigation shall be promptly commenced by AT&T.

12.7 Security Violations. AT&T reserves the right to interview Neutral Tandem’s employees, agents,
suppliers, or Guests in the event of wrongdoing in or around an AT&T Premises or involving
AT&T’s or another collocated telecommunications carrier’s property or personnel, provided that
AT&T shall provide reasonable notice to Neutral Tandem’s Security representative of such
interview. Neutral Tandem and its employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests shall reasonably
cooperate with AT&T’s investigation into allegations of wrongdoing or criminal conduct committed
by, witnessed by, or involving Neutral Tandem’s employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests.
Additionally, AT&T reserves the right to bill Neutral Tandem for all reasonable costs associated
with investigations involving its employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests if it is established and
mutually agreed in good faith that Neutral Tandem’s employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests are
responsible for the alleged act(s). AT&T shall bill Neutral Tandem for AT&T property, which is
stolen or damaged, where an investigation determines the culpability of Neutral Tandem’s
employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests and where Neutral Tandem agrees, in good faith, with the
results of such investigation. Neutral Tandem shall notify AT&T in writing immediately in the event
that Neutral Tandem discovers one of its employees, agents, suppliers, or Guests already working
on the AT&T Premises is a possible security risk. Upon request of the other Party, the Party who is
the employer shall discipline consistent with its employment practices, up to and including removal
from AT&T’s Premises, any employee found to have violated the security and safety requirements
of this Section. Neutral Tandem shall hold AT&T harmless for any damages resulting from such
removal of Neutral Tandem’s personnel from an AT&T Premises.
12.8 Use of Supplies. Unauthorized use of equipment, supplies or other property by either Party,
whether or not used routinely to provide telephone service will be strictly prohibited and handled
appropriately. Costs associated with such unauthorized use may be charged to the offending
Party, as may be all associated investigative costs.
12.9 Use of Official Lines. Except for non-toll calls necessary in the performance of their work, neither
Party shall use the telephone(s) of the other Party on AT&T’s Premises. Charges for unauthorized
telephone calls may be charged to the offending Party, as may be all associated investigative
costs.
12.10 Accountability. Full compliance with the Security requirements of this Section shall in no way limit
the accountability of either Party to the other for the improper actions of its employees, agents,
suppliers, or Guests.
13 Destruction of Collocation Space
13.1 In the event a Collocation Space is wholly or partially damaged by fire, windstorm, hurricane,
tornado, flood or by similar force majeure circumstances to such an extent as to be rendered
wholly unsuitable for Neutral Tandem’s permitted use hereunder, then either Party may elect within
ten (10) days after such damage, to terminate occupancy of the damaged Collocation Space, and if
either Party shall so elect, by giving the other written notice of termination, both Parties shall stand
released of and from further liability under the terms hereof. If the Collocation Space shall suffer
only minor damage and shall not be rendered wholly unsuitable for Neutral Tandem’s permitted
use, or is damaged and the option to terminate is not exercised by either Party, AT&T covenants
and agrees to proceed promptly without expense to Neutral Tandem, except for improvements not
to the property of AT&T, to repair the damage. AT&T shall have a reasonable time within which to
rebuild or make any repairs, and such rebuilding and repairing shall be subject to delays caused by
storms, shortages of labor and materials, government regulations, strikes, walkouts, and causes
beyond the control of AT&T, which causes shall not be construed as limiting factors, but as
exemplary only. Neutral Tandem may, at its own expense, accelerate the rebuild of its Collocation
Space and equipment provided, however, that an AT&T Certified Supplier is used and the

necessary space preparation has been completed. If Neutral Tandem’s acceleration of the project
increases the cost of the project, then those additional charges will be incurred at Neutral
Tandem’s expense. Where allowed and where practical, Neutral Tandem may erect a temporary
facility while AT&T rebuilds or makes repairs. In all cases where the Collocation Space shall be
rebuilt or repaired, Neutral Tandem shall be entitled to an equitable abatement of rent and other
charges, depending upon the unsuitability of the Collocation Space for Neutral Tandem’s permitted
use, until such Collocation Space is fully repaired and restored and Neutral Tandem’s equipment
installed therein (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Collocation Space is fully
repaired and restored). Where Neutral Tandem has placed an Adjacent Arrangement pursuant to
Section 3.4 above, Neutral Tandem shall have the sole responsibility to repair or replace said
Adjacent Arrangement provided herein. Pursuant to this Section, AT&T will restore the associated
services to the Adjacent Arrangement.
14 Eminent Domain
14.1 If the whole of a Collocation Space or Adjacent Arrangement shall be taken by any public authority
under the power of eminent domain, then this Attachment shall terminate with respect to such
Collocation Space or Adjacent Arrangement as of the date possession shall be taken by such
public authority and rent and other charges for the Collocation Space or Adjacent Arrangement
shall be paid up to that day with a proportionate refund by AT&T of such rent and charges as may
have been paid in advance for a period subsequent to the date of the taking. If any part of the
Collocation Space or Adjacent Arrangement shall be taken under eminent domain, AT&T and
Neutral Tandem shall each have the right to terminate this Attachment with respect to such
Collocation Space or Adjacent Arrangement and declare the same null and void, by written notice
of such intention to the other Party within ten (10) days after such taking.
15 None clusi it
15.1 Neutral Tandem understands that this Attachment is not exclusive and that AT&T may enter into
similar agreements with other Parties. Assignment of Collocation Space pursuant to all such
agreements shall be determined by space availability and made on a first come, first serve basis.

AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY PRINCIPLES
The following principles provide basic guidance on environmental and safety issues when applying for and
establishing physical collocation arrangements.
1. General Principles
1.1 Compliance with Applicable Law. AT&T and Neutral Tandem agree to comply with applicable
federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations including U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations issued under the Clean Air Act (CAA),
Clean Water Act (CWA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and Occupational Safety
and Healthy Act (OSHA) regulations issued under the OSHA of 1970, as amended and National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA), NEC and NESC (Applicable Laws) requirements. Each Party
shall notify the other if compliance inspections are conducted by regulatory agencies and/or
citations are issued that relate to any aspect of this Attachment.
1.2 Notice. AT&T and Neutral Tandem shall provide notice to the other, including any Material Safety
Data Sheets (MSDSs), of known and recognized physical hazards or Hazardous Chemicals
existing on site or brought on site. A Hazardous Chemical inventory list is posted on an OSHA
Poster and updated annually at each Central Office. This Poster is normally located near the front
entrance of the building or in the lounge area. Each Party is required to provide specific notice for
known potential Imminent Danger conditions. Neutral Tandem should contact 1-800-743-6737 for
any AT&T MSDS required.
1.3 Practices/Procedures. AT&T may make available additional environmental control procedures for
Neutral Tandem to follow when working at an AT&T Premises (See Section 2, below). These
practices/procedures will represent the regular work practices required to be followed by the
employees and suppliers of AT&T for environmental protection. Neutral Tandem will require its
suppliers, agents, Guests, and others accessing the AT&T Premises to comply with these
practices. Section 2 below lists the Environmental categories where AT&T practices should be
followed by Neutral Tandem when operating in the AT&T Premises.
1.4 Environmental and Safety Inspections. AT&T reserves the right to inspect the Neutral Tandem
space with proper notification. AT&T reserves the right to stop any Neutral Tandem work operation
that imposes Imminent Danger to the environment, employees or other persons in or around an
AT&T Premises.
1.5 Hazardous Materials Brought On Site. Any hazardous materials brought into, used, stored or
abandoned at an AT&T Premises by Neutral Tandem are owned by and considered the property of
Neutral Tandem. Neutral Tandem will indemnify AT&T for claims, lawsuits or damages to persons
or property caused by these materials. Without prior written AT&T approval, no substantial new
safety or environmental hazards can be created by Neutral Tandem or different hazardous
materials used by Neutral Tandem at an AT&T Premises. Neutral Tandem must demonstrate
adequate emergency response capabilities for the materials used by Neutral Tandem or remaining
at an AT&T Premises.
1.6 Spills and Releases. When contamination is discovered at an AT&T Premises, either Party
discovering the condition must notify the other Party. All Spills or Releases of regulated materials

AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
will immediately be reported by Neutral Tandem to AT&T.
1.7 Coordinated Environmental Plans and Permits. AT&T and Neutral Tandem will coordinate plans,
permits or information required to be submitted to government agencies, such as emergency
response plans, spill prevention control and countermeasures (SPCC) plans and community
reporting. If fees are associated with filing, AT&T and Neutral Tandem will develop a cost sharing
procedure. If AT&T’s permit or EPA identification number must be used, Neutral Tandem must
comply with all of AT&T’s permit conditions and environmental processes, including environmental
“best management practices (BMP)” (see Section 2, below) and the selection of AT&T disposition
vendors and disposal sites.
1.8 Environmental and Safety Indemnification. AT&T and Neutral Tandem shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the other Party from and against any claims (including, without limitation, third-party
claims for personal injury or death or real or personal property damage), judgments, damages
(including direct and indirect damages and punitive damages), penalties, fines, forfeitures, costs,
liabilities, interest and losses arising in connection with the violation or alleged violation of any
Applicable Law or contractual obligation or the presence or alleged presence of contamination
arising out of the acts or omissions of the indemnifying Party, its employees, agents, suppliers, or
Guests concerning its operations at an AT&T Premises.
2. Categories for Consideration of En ironmental Issues
2.1 When performing functions that fall under the following Environmental categories on AT&T’s
Premises, Neutral Tandem agrees to comply with the applicable sections of the current issue of
AT&T’s Environmental and Safety Methods and Procedures (M&Ps), incorporated herein by this
reference. Neutral Tandem further agrees to cooperate with AT&T to ensure that Neutral
Tandem’s employees, agents, suppliers and/or Guests are knowledgeable of and satisfy those
provisions of AT&T’s Environmental M&Ps, which apply to the specific Environmental function
being performed by Neutral Tandem, its employees, agents, suppliers, and/or Guests.

AT&T9-STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
ACCESS TO NUMBERS AND NUMBER PORTABILITY
1. Non-Discriminator Access to Telephone Numbers
1.1 During the term of this Agreement, where Neutral Tandem is utilizing its own switch, Neutral
Tandem shall contact the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), or, where
applicable, the relevant Number Pool Administrator for the assignment of numbering resources.
1.2 Where AT&T provides resold services to Neutral Tandem, AT&T will provide Neutral Tandem with
online access to available telephone numbers as defined by applicable FCC rules and regulations
on a first come first served basis. Neutral Tandem acknowledges that such access to numbers
shall be in accordance with the appropriate FCC rules and regulations. Neutral Tandem may
designate up to a forecasted six (6) months supply of available numbers as intermediate(an
available number provided to Neutral Tandem) telephone numbers per rate center if the following
conditions are met:
1.2.1 Neutral Tandem must: (1) indicate that all of the intermediate numbers currently held by Neutral
Tandem in each rate center where Neutral Tandem will be requesting intermediate telephone
numbers have six (6) or less months to exhaust; (2) supply projectedmonthly telephone number
demand on a rate center basis for the coming twelve (12) months for each rate center where
Neutral Tandem will be requesting intermediate telephone numbers; and, (3) demonstrate that the
utilization level on current intermediate numbers held by Neutral Tandem in the rate center where
Neutral Tandem is requesting telephone numbers has reached at least seventy-five percent (75%).
1.2.2 The above information will be provided by Neutral Tandem by submitting to AT&T a fully completed
“CO Code Assignments Months To Exhaust Certification Worksheet – TN Level” (MTE Worksheet),
Appendix B to the Central Office Code (NXX) Assignments Guidelines, INC 95-0407-008 for each
rate center where Neutral Tandem will be requesting intermediate telephone numbers. The
utilization level is calculated by dividing all intermediate numbers currently assigned by Neutral
Tandem to customers by the total number of intermediate numbers held by Neutral Tandem in the
rate center and multiplying the result by one hundred (100).
1.2.3 If fulfilling Neutral Tandem’s request for intermediate numbers results in AT&T having to submit a
request for additional telephone numbers to a national numbering administrator (either NANPA CO
Code Administration or NeuStar Pooling Administration or their successors), AT&T will submit the
required numbering request to the national numbering administrator to satisfy Neutral Tandem’s
request for intermediate numbers. AT&T will also pursue all appropriate steps (including submitting
a safety valve request (petition) to the appropriate Commission if the numbering request is denied
by the national administrator) to satisfy Neutral Tandem’s request for intermediate numbers. In
these cases, AT&T is not obligated to fulfill the request by Neutral Tandem for intermediate
numbers unless, and until, AT&T’s request for additional numbering resources is granted.

4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
1.2.4 Neutral Tandem agrees to supply supporting information for any numbering request and/or safety
valve request that AT&T files pursuant to Section 1.2.3 above.
1.3 Neutral Tandem acknowledges that there may be instances where there is an industry shortage of
available telephone numbers in a number plan area (NPA). These instances occur where a
jeopardy status has been declared by NANPA and the industry has determined that limiting the
assignment of new numbers is the appropriate method to employ until the jeopardy can be
alleviated. In such NPA jeopardy situations where assignment of new numbers is restricted per the
jeopardy guidelines developed by the industry, AT&T may request that Neutral Tandem cancel all
or a portion of its unassigned intermediate numbers. Neutral Tandem’s consent to AT&T’s request
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
2. Local Number Portabilit
2.1 The Parties will offer LNP in accordance with rules, regulations and guidelines adopted by the
Commission, the FCC and industry fora.
2.2 Service Management System (SMS) Administration. The Parties will work cooperatively with other
local service providers to establish and maintain contracts for the LNP SMS.
2.3 Network Architecture. The Parties agree to adhere to applicable FCC rules and orders governing
LNP network architecture.
2.4 Signaling. In connection with LNP, each Party agrees to use SS7 signaling in accordance with
applicable FCC rules and orders.
2.5 N-1 Query. The Parties agree to adhere to applicable FCC rules and orders governing LNP N-1
queries.
2.6 Porting of Reserved Numbers and Suspended Lines. Customers of each Party may port numbers,
via LNP, that are in a denied state or that are on suspend status. In addition, customers of each
Party may port reserved numbers that the customer has paid to reserve. Portable reserved
numbers are identified on the Customer Service Record (CSR). In anticipation of porting from one
Party to the other Party, a Party’s customer may reserve additional telephone numbers and include
them with the numbers that are subsequently ported to the other Party. It is not necessary to
restore a denied number before it is ported.
2.7 Splitting of Number Groups. The Parties shall permit blocks of subscriber numbers (including, but
not limited to, Direct Inward Dial (DID) numbers and MultiServ groups) to be split in connection with
an LNP request. AT&T and Neutral Tandem shall permit customers who port a portion of DID
numbers to retain DID service on the remaining portion of numbers. If a Party requests porting a
range of DID numbers smaller than a whole block, that Party shall pay the applicable charges for
doing so as set forth in Attachment 2. In the event no rate is set forth in Attachment 2, then the
Parties shall negotiate a rate for such services.
2.8 The Parties will set Location Routing Number (LRN) unconditional or ten (10) digit triggers where
applicable. Where triggers are set, the porting Party will remove the ported number at the same
time the trigger is removed.

AT&T9-STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
2.9 A trigger order is a service order issued in advance of the porting of a number. A trigger order 1)
initiates call queries to the AIN SS7 network in advance of the number being ported; and 2)
provides for the new service provider to be in control of when a number ports.
2.10 Where triggers are not set, the Parties shall coordinate the porting of the number between service
providers so as to minimize service interruptions to the customer.
2.11 AT&T and Neutral Tandem will work cooperatively to implement changes to LNP process flows
ordered by the FCC or as recommended by standard industry foras addressing LNP.
2.12 Where Neutral Tandem utilizes AT&T’s LNP Query Service, AT&T shall bill and Neutral Tandem
shall pay the query charge associated with LNP Query Service as set forth in Attachment 2. To
receive the LNP Query Service charge set forth in Attachment 2, Neutral Tandem shall fill out and
submit the Interconnection data sheet for AT&T LNP Query Service. The form can be obtained on
AT&T’s Wholesale - Southeast Region Web site under AT&T LNP Query Service and click on
forms. Once the form has been filled out and submitted the LNP Query charge will take effect on
the approved date. This charge is not subject to the resale discount set forth in Attachment 1.
3. Ser ice Order Charges
3.1 The terms, conditions and rates for OSS utilized in connection with LNP are as set forth in
Attachment 6 and Exhibit A of Attachment 2.

within twenty-four (24) hours of a valid request, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
2.2.3 The Parties agree not to view, copy, or otherwise obtain access to the other Party’s customer
record information about any of the other Party’s customers without that customer’s permission.
Neutral Tandem will obtain access to customer record information only in strict compliance with
applicable laws, rules, or regulations of the state in which the service is provided. AT&T reserves
the right to audit Neutral Tandem’s access to customer record information. If AT&T has reason to
believe, through its audit or by any other means, that Neutral Tandem is accessing customer record
information without having obtained the proper customer authorization, AT&T upon reasonable
notice to Neutral Tandem may take corrective action, including but not limited to suspending or
terminating Neutral Tandem’s access to AT&T’s pre-ordering and ordering OSS, and the
provisioning of pending and existing services.
2.3 Ordering
2.3.1 AT&T will make available to Neutral Tandem electronic interfaces for the purpose of exchanging
order information, including order status and completion notification, for non-complex and certain
complex resale requests and certain network elements. Specifications for access and use of
AT&T’s electronic interfaces are set forth at AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. The
process by which the Parties will manage these electronic interfaces to include the development
and introduction of new interfaces will be governed by the change management process as
described in Section 2.7 below.
2.3.2 Neutral Tandem shall place orders for services by submitting a LSR to AT&T. AT&T shall bill
Neutral Tandem an electronic service order charge at the rate set forth in the applicable Attachment
to this Agreement for each LSR submitted by means of an electronic interface. AT&T shall bill

fax, courier, etc.). An individual LSR will be identified for billingpurposes by its PON.
2.3.2.1 Neutral Tandem may submit an LSR to request that a customer’s service be temporarily
suspended, denied, or restored. Alternatively, Neutral Tandem may submit a list of such customers
if Neutral Tandem provides a separate PON for each location on the list. AT&T will bill an electronic
or manual service order charge for each location.
2.3.2.2 AT&T will bill the electronic or manual service order charge, as applicable, for an LSR, regardless
of whether that LSR is later supplemented, clarified or cancelled.
2.3.2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T will not bill an additional electronic or manual service order
charge for supplements to any LSR submitted to clarify, correct, change or cancel a previously
submitted LSR.

2.3.2.4 AT&T shall return a Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) or LSR clarification in accordance with the
applicable performance intervals referenced in Attachment 9. Neutral Tandem shall provide to
AT&T a FOC within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt from AT&T of a complete and accurate
LSR, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Neutral Tandem shall provide to AT&T an
LSR clarification within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt from AT&T of an incomplete and
inaccurate LSR, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
2.4 Provisioning
2.4.1 AT&T shall provision services during its regular working hours. To the extent Neutral Tandem
requests provisioning of service to be performed outside AT&T’s regular working hours, or the work
so requested requires AT&T’s technicians or project managers to work outside of regular working
hours, overtime charges set forth in AT&T’s intrastate Access Services Tariff, Section E13.2, shall
apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such work is performed outside of regular working hours by
a AT&T technician or project manager during his or her scheduled shift and AT&T does not incur
any overtime charges in performing the work on behalf of Neutral Tandem, AT&T will not assess
Neutral Tandem additional charges beyond the rates and charges specified in this Agreement.
2.4.2 In the event AT&T must dispatch to the customer’s location more than once due to incorrect or
incomplete information provided by Neutral Tandem (e.g., incomplete address, incorrect contact
name/number, etc.), AT&T will bill Neutral Tandem for each additional dispatch required to
provision the circuit due to the incorrect/incomplete information provided. AT&T will assess the
applicable Maintenance of Service rates from BellSouth’s FCC No. 1 Tariff, Section 13.3.1.
2.4.3 Cancellation Charges. If Neutral Tandem cancels an LSR for network elements or resold services
subsequent to AT&T's generation of a service order, any costs incurred by AT&T in conjunction
with provisioning of Services as requested on the cancelled LSR will be recovered in accordance
with the cancellation methodology set forth in the Cancellation Charge Percentage Chart found on
AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast Region Web site. In addition, AT&T reserves the right to assess
cancellation charges if Neutral Tandem fails to respond within nine (9) business days to a Missed
Appointment order notification.
2.4.3.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Neutral Tandem places an LSR based upon AT&T’s loop makeup
information, and such information is inaccurate resulting in the inability of AT&T to provision the
network elements requested and another spare compatible facility cannot be found with the
transmission characteristics of the network elements originally requested, cancellation charges
described in this Section shall not apply. Where Neutral Tandem places a single LSR for multiple
network elements or services based upon loop makeup information, and information as to some,
but not all, of the network elements or services is inaccurate, if AT&T cannot provision the network
elements or services that were the subject of the inaccurate loop makeup information, Neutral
Tandem may cancel its request for those network elements or services without incurring
cancellation charges as described in this Section. In such instance, should Neutral Tandem elect to
cancel the entire LSR, cancellation charges as described in this Section shall apply to those
elements and services that were not the subject of inaccurate loop makeup.

2.6 Billing. AT&T will provide Neutral Tandem nondiscriminatory access to billing information as
specified in Attachment 7.
2.7 Change Management. The Parties agreethat the collaborative change management process
known as the Change Control Process (CCP) will be used to manage changes to existing
interfaces, introduction of new interfaces and retirement of interfaces. The Parties agree to comply
with the provisions of the documented CCP as may be amended from time to time and incorporated
herein by reference. The change management process will cover changes to AT&T’s electronic
interfaces, AT&T’s testing environment, associated manual process improvements, and relevant
documentation. The process will define a procedure for resolution of change management
disputes. Documentation of the CCP as well as related information and processes will be clearly
organized and readily accessible to Neutral Tandemat AT&T’s Wholesale – Southeast Region
Web site.
2.8 Rates. Unless otherwise specified herein, charges for the use of AT&T’s OSS, and other charges
applicable to pre-ordering, ordering, provisioning and maintenance and repair, shall be at the rates
set forth in the applicable Attachment of this Agreement.
2.9 The Commissions in some states have ordered per element manual additive nonrecurring charges
for Network Elements and Other Services ordered by means other than one of the interactive
interfaces. These ordered Network Elements and Other Services manual additive nonrecurring
charges will apply in these states, rather than the charge per LSR. The per element charges are
listed in Exhibit A of Attachment 2.
3. Miscellaneous
3.1 Pending Orders. To the extent that Neutral Tandem submits an LSR with incomplete, incorrect or
conflicting information, AT&T will return the LSR to Neutral Tandem for clarification. Neutral
Tandem shall respond to the request for clarification within thirty (30) days by submitting a
supplemental LSR. If Neutral Tandem does not submit a supplement LSR within thirty (30) days,
AT&T will cancel the original LSR and Neutral Tandem shall be required to submit a new LSR, with
a new PON.
3.2 Single Point of Contact. Neutral Tandem will be the single point of contact with AT&T for ordering
activity for network elements and other services used by Neutral Tandem to provide services to its
customers, except that AT&T may accept a request directly from another CLEC, or AT&T, acting
with authorization of the affected customer. Neutral Tandem and AT&T shall each execute a
blanket LOA with respect to customer requests so that prior proof of customer authorization will not
be necessary with every request (except in the case of a local service freeze). The Parties shall
each be entitled to adopt their own internal processes for verification of customer authorization for
requests, provided, however, that such processes shall comply with applicable state and federal
law and industry and regulatory guidelines. Pursuant to a request from another carrier, AT&T may
disconnect any network element being used by Neutral Tandem to provide service to that customer
and may reuse such network elements or facilities to enable such other carrier to provide service to
the customer. AT&T will notify Neutral Tandem that such a request has been processed but will not
be required to notify Neutral Tandem in advance of such processing.

3.2.1 Neither Party shall prevent or delay a customer from migrating to another carrier because of unpaid
bills, denied service, or contract terms.
3.2.2 Use of Facilities. When a customer of Neutral Tandem elects to discontinue service and to transfer
service to another local exchange carrier, including AT&T, AT&T shall have the right to reuse the
facilities provided to Neutral Tandem, regardless whether those facilities are provided as Network
Elements or as part of a resold service, and regardless of whether the end user served with such
facilities has paid all charges to Neutral Tandem or has been denied service for nonpayment or
otherwise. AT&T will notify Neutral Tandem that such a request has been processed after the
disconnect order has been completed.
3.3 Contact Numbers. The Parties agree to provide one another with toll-free nation-wide (50 states)
contact numbers for the purpose of ordering, provisioning and maintenance of services. Contact
numbers for maintenance/repair of services shall be staffed twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven
(7)days per week. AT&T will close trouble tickets after making a reasonable effort to contact
Neutral Tandem for authorization to close a ticket. AT&T will place trouble tickets in delayed
maintenance status after making a reasonable effort to contact Neutral Tandem to request
additional information or to request authorization for additional work deemed necessary by AT&T.
3.4 Subscription Functions. In cases where AT&T performs subscription functions for an IXC (i.e., PIC
and LPIC changes via Customer Account Record Exchange (CARE)), AT&T will in all possible
instances provide the affected IXCs with the OCN of the local provider for the purpose of obtaining
customer billing account and other customer information required under subscription requirements.
3.4.1 When Neutral Tandem’s customer, served by resale or loop and port combinations, changes its
PIC or LPIC, and per AT&T’s FCC or state tariff the interexchange carrier elects to charge the
customer the PIC or LPIC change charge, AT&T will bill the PIC or LPIC change charge to Neutral

amount billed prior to AT&T’s receipt of a properly completed exemption certificate, AT&T shall
assign to Neutral Tandem its rights to claim a refund of such taxes. If applicable law prohibits the
assignment of tax refund rights or requires the claim for refund of such taxes to be filed by AT&T,
AT&T shall, after receiving a written request from Neutral Tandem and at Neutral Tandem’s sole
expense, pursue such refund claim on behalf of Neutral Tandem, provided that Neutral Tandem
promptly reimburses AT&T for any costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in pursuing such refund
claim; and, provided further, that AT&T shall have the right to deduct any such outstanding costs
and expenses from the amount of any refund obtained prior to remitting such refund to Neutral
Tandem or to deduct any such outstanding costs and expenses from any amounts owed by AT&T
to Neutral Tandem if no refund is obtained. Neutral Tandem shall be solely responsible for the
computation, tracking, reporting and payment of all taxes and fees associated with the services
provided by Neutral Tandem to its customers.

Tandem shall complete the AT&T Credit Profile (AT&T form) and provide information to AT&T
regarding Neutral Tandem’s credit and financial condition. Based on AT&T’s analysis of the AT&T

of security deposit for Neutral Tandem’s account(s). If, in AT&T’s sole discretion, circumstances so
warrant and/or Neutral Tandem’s gross monthly billing has increased, AT&T reserves the right to
request additional security (or to require a security deposit if none was previously requested)
and/or file a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC-1) security interest in Neutral Tandem’s “accounts
receivables and proceeds”.
1.3.1 Security deposit shall take the form of cash, an irrevocable letter of credit (AT&T form), surety bond
(AT&T form) or, in AT&T’s sole discretion, some other form of security proposed by Neutral
Tandem and accepted by AT&T. Any such security deposit shall in no way release Neutral
Tandem from its obligation to make complete and timely payments of its bill(s). If AT&T requires
Neutral Tandem to provide a security deposit, Neutral Tandem shall provide such security deposit
prior to the inauguration of service or within fifteen (15) days of AT&T’s request, as applicable.
Security deposit request notices will be sent to Neutral Tandem via certified mail or overnight

or refunded in accordance with the terms in AT&T’s GSST.
1.3.2 Security deposits collected under this Section shall not exceed two (2) months’ estimated billing for
services pursuant to this Agreement. Estimated billings are calculated based upon the monthly
average of the previous six (6) months current billings, if Neutral Tandem has received service from
AT&T during such period at a level comparable to that anticipated to occur over the next six (6)
months. If either Neutral Tandem or AT&T has reason to believe that the level of service to be
received during the next six (6) months will be materially higher or lower than received in the
previous six (6) months, Neutral Tandem and AT&T shall agree on a level of estimated billings
based on all relevant information.
1.3.3 In the event Neutral Tandem fails to provide AT&T with a suitable form of security deposit or
additional security deposit as required herein, defaults on its account(s), or otherwise fails to make
any payment or payments required under this Agreement in the manner and within the time
required, service to Neutral Tandem may be Suspended, Discontinued or Terminated in
accordance with the terms of Section 1.5 below. Upon Termination of services, AT&T shall apply
any security deposit to Neutral Tandem’s final bill for its account(s). If no bill is rendered to Neutral
Tandem, AT&T shall, nevertheless, apply any security deposit to Neutral Tandem’s outstanding
balance.

security under this Agreement, Neutral Tandem shall renew such letter of credit or provide AT&T
with evidence that Neutral Tandem has obtained a suitable replacement for the letter of credit. If
Neutral Tandem fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T shall thereafter be authorized, in its sole
discretion, to draw down the full amount of such letter of credit and utilize the cash proceeds as
security for Neutral Tandem accounts(s). If Neutral Tandem provides a security deposit or
additional security deposit in the form of a surety bond as required herein, Neutral Tandem shall
renew the surety bond or provide AT&T with evidence that Neutral Tandem has obtained a suitable
replacement for the surety bond at least seven (7) days prior to the cancellation date of the surety
bond. If Neutral Tandem fails to comply with the foregoing, AT&T shall thereafter be authorized, in
its sole discretion, to take action on the surety bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for
Neutral Tandem’s account(s). If the credit rating of any bonding company that has provided Neutral

Tandem with a surety bond provided as security hereunder has fallen below B, AT&T will provide
written notice to Neutral Tandem that Neutral Tandem must provide a replacement bond or other
suitable security within fifteen (15) days of AT&T’s written notice. If Neutral Tandem fails to comply
with the foregoing, AT&T shall thereafter be authorized, in its sole discretion, to take action on the
surety bond and utilize the cash proceeds as security for Neutral Tandem’s account(s).
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, AT&T shall be authorized, in
its sole discretion, to draw down the full amount of any letter of credit or take action on any surety
bond provided by Neutral Tandem as security hereunder if Neutral Tandem defaults on its
account(s) or otherwise fails to make any payment or payments required under this Agreement in
the manner and within the time, as required herein and apply the cash proceeds to any outstanding

have been made when the payment and Remittance Information are received by AT&T. If the
Remittance Information is not received with payment, AT&T will be unable to apply amounts paid to
Neutral Tandem’s accounts. In such event, AT&T shall hold such funds until the Remittance
Information is received. If AT&T does not receive the Remittance Information by the payment due
date for any account(s), late payment charges shall apply.

upon resolution of the billing dispute.
3. Non-InterCompan Settlements
3.1 Direct Participants are Telecommunications carriers that exchange data directly with other Direct
Participants via the Centralized Message Distribution System (CMDS) Data Center (Direct
Participant) and may act as host companies (Host) for those Telecommunications carriers that do
not exchange data directly via the CMDS Data Center.
3.2 The Non-InterCompany Settlements (NICS) is the national system administered by Telcordia that is
used in the settlement of revenues for calls that are originated and billed by two (2) different local
exchange carriers (LEC) within a single Direct Participant’s territory to another for billing. NICS
applies to calls involving another LEC where the Earning Company and the Billing Company are
located within AT&T’s Southeast Region 9-State.
3.3 In association with message distribution service, AT&T will provide Neutral Tandem with associated
intercompany settlements reports as appropriate.
3.4 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no case shall either Party be liable to
the other for any direct or consequential damages incurred as a result of the obligations set out in
this Section 3.

4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
1.0 PURPOSE
In the unlikely event of a disaster occurring that affects AT&T’s long-term ability to deliver traffic to a CLEC,
general procedures have been developed by AT&T to hasten the recovery process in accordance with the
Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program established by the FCC to identify and prioritize
telecommunication services that support national security or emergency preparedness (NS/EP) missions. A
description of the TSP Program as it may be amended from time to time is available on AT&T’s Wholesale –
Southeast Region Web site. Since each location is different and could be affected by an assortment of
potential problems, a detailed recovery plan is impractical. However, in the process of reviewing recovery
activities for specific locations, some basic procedures emerge that appear to be common in most cases.
These general procedures should apply to any disaster that affects the delivery of traffic for an extended
time period. Each CLEC will be given the same consideration during an outage, and service will be restored
as quickly as possible.
This document will cover the basic recovery procedures that would apply to every CLEC.
2.0 SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT
When a problem is experienced, regardless of the severity, the AT&T Network Management Center (NMC)
will observe traffic anomalies and begin monitoring the situation. Controls will be appropriately applied to
insure the sanity of AT&T’s network; and, in the event that a switch or facility node is lost, the NMC will
attempt to circumvent the failure using available reroutes.
AT&T’s NMC will remain in control of the restoration efforts until the problem has been identified as being a
long-term outage. At that time, the NMC will contact AT&T’s ECC and relinquish control of the recovery
efforts. Even though the ECC may take charge of the situation, the NMC will continue to monitor the
circumstances and restore traffic as soon as damaged network elements are revitalized.
The telephone number for the AT&T Net ork Management Center in Atlanta, as published in
Telcordias National Net ork Management Director , is 404-321-2516.
3.0 IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM
During the early stages of problem detection, the NMC will be able to tell which CLECs are affected by the
catastrophe. Further analysis and/or first hand observation will determine if the disaster has affected CLEC
equipment only, AT&T equipment only or a combination. The initial restoration activity will be largely
determined by the equipment that is affected.
Once the nature of the disaster is determined and after verifying the cause of the problem, the NMC will
initiate reroutes and/or transfers that are jointly agreed upon by the affected CLECs’ Network Management
Center and the AT&T NMC. The type and percentage of controls used will depend upon available network
capacity. Controls necessary to stabilize the situation will be invoked and the NMC will attempt to re-
establish as much traffic as possible.
For long-term outages, recovery efforts will be coordinated by the ECC. Traffic controls will continue to be
applied by the NMC until facilities are re-established. As equipment is made available for service, the ECC
will instruct the NMC to begin removing the controls and allow traffic to resume.

AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
3.1 SITE CONTROL
In the total loss of building use scenario, what likely exists will be a smoking pile of rubble. This rubble will
contain many components that could be dangerous. It could also contain any personnel on the premises at
the time of the disaster. For these reasons, the local fire marshal with the assistance of the police will
control the site until the building is no longer a threat to surrounding properties and the companies have
secured the site from the general public.
During this time, the majority owner of the building should be arranging for a demolition contractor to
mobilize to the site with the primary objective of reaching the cable entrance facility for a damage
assessment. The results of this assessment would then dictate immediate plans for restoration, both short
term and permanent.
In a less catastrophic event, i.e., the building is still standing and the cable entrance facility is usable, the
situation is more complex. The site will initially be controlled by local authorities until the threat to adjacent
property has diminished. Once the site is returned to the control of the companies, the following events
should occur.
An initial assessment of the main building infrastructure systems (mechanical, electrical, fire and life safety,
elevators, and others) will establish building needs. Once these needs are determined, the majority owner
should lead the building restoration efforts. There may be situations where the site will not be totally
restored within the confines of the building. The companies must individually determine their needs and
jointly assess the cost of permanent restoration to determine the overall plan of action.
Multiple restoration trailers from each company will result in the need for designated space and installation
order. This layout and control is required to maximize the amount of restoration equipment that can be
placed at the site, and the priority of placements.
Care must be taken in this planning to ensure other restoration efforts have logistical access to the building.
Major components of telephone and building equipment will need to be removed and replaced. A priority for
this equipment must also be jointly established to facilitate overall site restoration. (Example: If the AC
switchgear has sustained damage, this would be of the highest priority in order to regain power, lighting, and
HVAC throughout the building.)
If the site will not accommodate the required restoration equipment, the companies would then need to
quickly arrange with local authorities for street closures, rights of way or other possible options available.

4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
In the worse case scenario, many environmental concerns must be addressed. Along with the police and
fire marshal, the state environmental protection department will be on site to monitor the situation.
Items to be concerned with in a large central office building could include:
1.Emergency engine fuel supply. Damage to the standby equipment and the fuel handling
equipment could have created “spill” conditions that have to be handled within state and federal
regulations.
2.Asbestos-containing materials that may be spread throughout the wreckage. Asbestos could be
in many components of building, electrical, mechanical, outside plant distribution, and telephone
systems.
3.Lead and acid. These materials could be present in potentially large quantities depending upon
the extent of damage to the power room.
4.Mercury and other regulated compounds resident in telephone equipment.
5.Other compounds produced by the fire or heat.
Once a total loss event occurs at a large site, local authorities will control immediate clean up (water placed
on the wreckage by the fire department) and site access.
At some point, the companies will become involved with local authorities in the overall planning associated
with site clean up and restoration. Depending on the clean up approach taken, delays in the restoration of
several hours to several days may occur.
In a less severe disaster, items listed above are more defined and can be addressed individually depending
on the damage.
In each case, the majority owner should coordinate building and environmental restoration as well as
maintain proper planning and site control.
4.0 THE ECC
The ECC is located in the Midtown 1 Building in Atlanta, Georgia. During an emergency, the ECC staff will
convene a group of pre-selected experts to inventory the damage and initiate corrective actions. These
experts have regional access to AT&T’s personnel and equipment and will assume control of the restoration
activity anywhere in the nine-state area.
In the past, the ECC has been involved with restoration activities resulting from hurricanes, ice storms and
floods. They have demonstrated their capabilities during these calamities as well as during outages caused
by human error or equipment failures. This group has an excellent record of restoring service as quickly as
possible.

PAGE 5 OF 9
AT&T-9STATE/Neutral Tandem
4Q07 STD ICA – 11/13/07
During a major disaster, the ECC may move emergency equipment to the affected location, direct recovery
efforts of local personnel and coordinate service restoration activities with the CLECs. The ECC will attempt
to restore service as quickly as possible using whatever means is available, leaving permanent solutions,
such as the replacement of damaged buildings or equipment, for local personnel to administer.
Part of the ECC’s responsibility, after temporary equipment is in place, is to support the NMC efforts to
return service to the CLECs. Once service has been restored, the ECC will return control of the network to
normal operational organizations. Any long-term changes required after service is restored will be made in
an orderly fashion and will be conducted as normal activity.
5.0 RECOVERY PROCEDURES
The nature and severity of any disaster will influence the recovery procedures. One crucial factor in
determining how AT&T will proceed with restoration is whether or not AT&T’s equipment is incapacitated.
Regardless of whose equipment is out of service, AT&T will move as quickly as possible to aid with service
recovery; however, the approach that will be taken may differ depending upon the location of the problem.
5.1 CLEC OUTAGE
For a problem limited to one CLEC (or a building with multiple CLECs), AT&T has several options available
for restoring service quickly. For those CLECs that have agreements with other CLECs, AT&T can
immediately start directing traffic to a provisional CLEC for completion. This alternative is dependent upon
AT&T having concurrence from the affected CLECs.
Whether or not the affected CLECs have requested a traffic transfer to another CLEC will not impact AT&T’s
resolve to re-establish traffic to the original destination as quickly as possible.
5.2 AT&T OUTAGE
Because AT&T’s equipment has varying degrees of impact on the service provided to the CLECs, restoring
service from damaged AT&T equipment is different. The outage will probably impact a number of Carriers
simultaneously. However, the ECC will be able to initiate immediate actions to correct the problem.
A disaster involving any of AT&T’s equipment locations could impact the CLECs, some more than others. A
disaster at a Central Office (CO) would only impact the delivery of traffic to and from that one location, but
the incident could affect many Carriers. If the CO is a Serving Wire Center (SWC), then traffic from the
entire area to those Carriers served from that switch would also be impacted. If the switch functions as an
Access Tandem, or there is a tandem in the building, traffic from every CO to every CLEC could be
interrupted. A disaster that destroys a facility hub could disrupt various traffic flows, even though the
switching equipment may be unaffected.
The NMC would be the first group to observe a problem involving AT&T’s equipment. Shortly after a
disaster, the NMC will begin applying controls and finding re-routes for the completion of as much traffic as
possible. These reroutes may involve delivering traffic to alternate Carriers upon receiving approval from
the CLECs involved. In some cases, changes in translations will be required. If the outage is caused by the
destruction of equipment, then the ECC will assume control of the restoration.

5.2.1 Loss of a CO
When AT&T loses a CO, the ECC will
a)Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
b)Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
c)Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken area, if
necessary;
d)Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other emergency agencies
or customers served by AT&T or CLEC in accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding
scheme entered in the AT&T Maintenance database prior to the emergency.
5.2.2 Loss of a CO ith SWC Functions
The loss of a CO that also serves as a SWC will be restored as described in Section 5.2.1.
5.2.3 Loss of a CO ith Tandem Functions
When AT&T loses a CO building that serves as an Access Tandem and as a SWC, the ECC will
a)Place specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
b)Inventory the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
c)Move containerized emergency equipment and facility equipment to the stricken area, if
necessary;
d)Begin reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other emergency agencies
or customers served by AT&T or CLEC in accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding
scheme entered in the AT&T Maintenance database prior to the emergency;
e)Re-direct as much traffic as possible to the alternate access tandem (if available) for delivery to
those CLECs utilizing a different location as a SWC;
f)Begin aggregating traffic to a location near the damaged building. From this location, begin re-
establishing trunk groups to the CLECs for the delivery of traffic normally found on the direct trunk
groups. (This aggregation point may be the alternate access tandem location or another CO on a
primary facility route.)

5.2.4 Loss of a Facilit Hub
In the event that AT&T loses a facility hub, the recovery process is much the same as above. Once the
NMC has observed the problem and administered the appropriate controls, the ECC will assume authority
for the repairs. The recovery effort will include
a)Placing specialists and emergency equipment on notice;
b)Inventorying the damage to determine what equipment and/or functions are lost;
c)Moving containerized emergency equipment to the stricken area, if necessary;
d)Reconnecting service on a parity basis for Hospitals, Police and other emergency agencies or
customers served by AT&T or CLEC in accordance with the TSP priority restoration coding
scheme entered in the AT&T Maintenance database prior to the emergency; and
e)If necessary, AT&T will aggregate the traffic at another location and build temporary facilities.
This alternative would be viable for a location that is destroyed and building repairs are required.
5.3 COMBINED OUTAGE (CLEC AND AT&T EQUIPMENT)
In some instances, a disaster may impact AT&T’s equipment as well as the CLECs’. This situation will be
handled in much the same way as described in Section 5.2.3. Since AT&T and the CLECs will be utilizing
temporary equipment, close coordination will be required.
6.0 T1 IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES
During the restoration of service after a disaster, AT&T may be forced to aggregate traffic for delivery to a
CLEC. During this process, T1 traffic may be consolidated onto DS3s and may become unidentifiable to the
Carrier. Because resources will be limited, AT&T may be forced to “package” this traffic entirely differently
than normally received by the CLECs. Therefore, a method for identifying the T1 traffic on the DS3s and
providing the information to the Carriers is required.

HurricaneInformation
During a hurricane, AT&T will make every effort to keep CLECs updated on the status of our network.
Information centers will be set up throughout AT&T. These centers are not intended to be used for
escalations, but rather to keep the CLEC informed of network related issues, area damages and dispatch
conditions, etc.
Hurricane-related information can also be found on AT&T’s Wholesale - Southeast Web site by clicking on
the link “Relief Information” in the special alert box located on the Web page. Additionally, information
concerning Mechanized Disaster Reports can also be found by clicking on the link “Click here for
information concerning Disaster Recovery Reports” on the Hurricane Relief page.
AT&T Disaster Management Plan
AT&T maintenance centers have geographical and redundant communication capabilities. In the event of a
disaster removing any maintenance center from service another geographical center would assume
maintenance responsibilities. The contact numbers will not change and the transfer will be transparent to
the CLEC.

BONA FIDE REQUEST AND NEW BUSINESS REQUEST PROCESS
1. Bona Fide Request
1.1 The Parties agree that Neutral Tandem is entitled to order any Network Element,
interconnection option or service option required to be made available by FCC or
Commission requirements pursuant to the Act. A Bona Fide Request (BFR) is to be used
when Neutral Tandem makes a request of AT&T to provide a new or modified Network
Element, interconnection option or other service option pursuant to the Act that was not
previously provided for in this Agreement.
1.2 A BFR shall be submitted in writing by Neutral Tandem and shall specifically identify the
requested service date, technical requirements, space requirements and/or such other
specifications that clearly define the request such that AT&T has sufficient information to
analyze and prepare a response. Such a request shall also include Neutral Tandem’s
designation of the request as being pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (i.e.,
a BFR). The request shall be sent to Neutral Tandem’s designated AT&T Sales contact
or Local Service Specialist (LSS).
1.3 Within two (2) business days of receipt of a BFR, AT&T shall acknowledge in writing its
receipt and identify a single point of contact responsible for responding to the BFR and
shall request any additional information needed to process the request to the extent
known at that time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T may reasonably request
additional information from Neutral Tandem at any time during the processing of the BFR.
1.4 Within thirty (30) business days of AT&T’s receipt of the BFR, if the preliminary analysis of
the requested BFR is not of such complexity that it will cause AT&T to expend
extraordinary resources to evaluate the BFR, AT&T shall respond to Neutral Tandem by
providing a preliminary analysis of the new or modified Network Element or
interconnection option not ordered by the FCC or Commission that is the subject of the
BFR. The preliminary analysis shall either confirm that AT&T will offer access to the new
or modified Network Element, interconnection option or service option or confirm that
AT&T will not offer the new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or
service option.
1.5 For any new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or service option not
ordered by the FCC or Commission, if the preliminary analysis states that AT&T will offer
the new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or service option, the
preliminary analysis will include an estimate of the costs of utilizing existing resources,
both personnel and systems, in the development including, but not limited to, request
parameters analysis, determination of impacted AT&T departments, determination of
required resources, project management resources, etc. (Development Rate) including a
general breakdown of such costs associated with the Network Element, interconnection
option or service option and the date the request can be met. If the preliminary analysis
states that AT&T will not offer the new or modified Network Element, interconnection
option or service option, AT&T will provide an explanation of why the request is not
technically feasible, does not qualify as a BFR for the new or modified Network Element,

interconnection option or service option, should actually be submitted as a New Business
Request (NBR) or is otherwise not required to be provided under the Act. If AT&T cannot
provide the Network Element, interconnection option or service option by the requested
date, AT&T shall provide an alternative proposed date together with a detailed
explanation as to why AT&T is not able to meet Neutral Tandem’s requested date.
1.6 For any new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or service option not
ordered by the FCC or Commission, if AT&T determines that the preliminary analysis of
the requested BFR is of such complexity that it will cause AT&T to expend extraordinary
resources to evaluate the BFR, AT&T shall notify Neutral Tandem within ten (10) business
days of AT&T’s receipt of BFR that a fee will be required prior to the preliminary
evaluation of the BFR. Such fee shall be limited to AT&T’s extraordinary expenses
directly related to the complex request that require the allocation and engagement of
additional resources above the existing allocated resources used on BFR cost
development which include, but are not limited to, expenditure of funds to develop
feasibility studies, specific resources that are required to determine request requirements
(such as operation support system analysts, technical managers, software developers),
software impact analysis by specific software developers; software architecture
development, hardware impact analysis by specificsystem analysts, etc. and the request
for such fee shall be accompanied with a general breakdown of such costs. If Neutral
Tandem accepts the complex request evaluation fee proposed by AT&T, Neutral Tandem
shall submit such fee within thirty (30) business days of AT&T’s notice that a complex
request evaluation fee is required. Within thirty (30) businessdays of AT&T’s receipt of
the complex request evaluationfee,AT&T shall respond to Neutral Tandem by providing
a preliminary analysis, consistent with Section 1.4 above.
1.7 Neutral Tandem may cancel a BFR at any time up until thirty (30) business days after
receiving AT&T’s preliminary analysis. If Neutral Tandem cancels the BFR within thirty
(30)business days after receipt of AT&T’s preliminary analysis, AT&T shall be entitled to
keep any complex request evaluation fee submitted in accordance with Section 1.6
above, minus those costs included in the fee that have not been incurred as of the date of
cancellation.
1.8 Neutral Tandem will have thirty (30) business days from receipt of preliminary analysis to
accept the preliminary analysis or cancel the BFR. If Neutral Tandem fails to respond
within this thirty (30) business day period, the BFR will be deemed cancelled. Acceptance
of the preliminary analysis must beinwriting and accompanied by theestimated
Development Rate for the new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or
service option quoted in the preliminary analysis.
1.9 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, AT&T shall propose a firm price
quote, including the firm Development Rate, the firm nonrecurring rate and the firm
recurring rate, and a detailed implementation plan within ten (10) business days of receipt
of Neutral Tandem’s accurate BFR application for a Network Element, interconnection
option or service option that is operational at the time of the request; thirty (30) business
days of receipt of Neutral Tandem’s accurate BFR application for a new or modified
Network Element, interconnection option or service option ordered by the FCC or

Commission; and within sixty (60) business days of receipt of Neutral Tandem’s accurate
BFR application for a new or modified Network Element, interconnection option or service
option not ordered by the FCC or Commission or not operational at the time of the
request. The firm nonrecurring rate will not include any of the Development Rate or the
complex request evaluation fee, if required, in the calculation of this rate. Such firm price
quote shall not exceed the estimate provided with the preliminary analysis by more than
twenty-five percent (25%).
1.10 Neutral Tandem shall have thirty (30) business days from receipt of firm price quote to
accept or deny the firm price quote and submit any additional Development or
nonrecurring rates quoted in the firm price quote.
1.11 Unless Neutral Tandem agrees otherwise, all prices shall be consistent with the
applicable pricing principles and provisionsof the Act.
1.12 If Neutral Tandem believes that AT&T’s firm price quote is not consistent with the
requirements of the Act, either Party may seek dispute resolution in accordance with the

2 Ne Business Request
2.1 Neutral Tandem also shall be permitted to request the development of new or modified
facilities or service options which may not be required by the Act. Procedures applicable
to requesting the addition of such elements, services and options are specified in this
Attachment. A NBR is to be used by Neutral Tandem to make a request of AT&T for a
new or modified feature or capability of an existing product or service, a new product or
service that is not deployed within the AT&T network or operations and business support
systems, or a new or modified service option that was not previously included in this
Agreement (Requested NBR Services) and is not required by the Act.
2.2 An NBR shall be submitted in writing by Neutral Tandem and shall specifically identify the
requested service date, technical requirements, space requirements and/or such
specifications that clearly define the request such that AT&T has sufficient information to
analyze and prepare a response. The request shall be sent to Neutral Tandem’s
designated AT&T Sales contact or LSS.
2.3 Within two (2) business days of receipt of an NBR, AT&T shall acknowledge in writing its
receipt and identify a single point of contact responsible for responding to the NBR and
shall request any additional information needed to process the request to the extent
known at that time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T may reasonably request
additional information from Neutral Tandem at any time during the processing of the NBR.
2.4 If the preliminary analysis of the requested NBR is not of such complexity that it will cause
AT&T to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the NBR, within thirty (30) business
days of its receipt of the NBR, AT&T shall respond to Neutral Tandem by providing a

preliminary analysis of such Requested NBR Services that are the subject of the NBR.
The preliminary analysis shall either confirm that AT&T will offer access to the Requested
NBR Services or confirm that AT&T will not offer the Requested NBR Services.
2.5 If the preliminary analysis states that AT&T willoffer the Requested NBR Services, the
preliminary analysis will include an estimate of the Development Rate including a general
breakdown of costs and the date the request can be met. If AT&T cannot provide the
Requested NBR Service by the requested date, it shall provide an alternative proposed
date together with a detailed explanation as to why AT&T is not able to meet Neutral
Tandem’s requested date.
2.6 If AT&T determines that the preliminary analysis of the requested NBR is of such
complexity that it will cause AT&T to expend extraordinary resources to evaluate the NBR,
AT&T shall notify Neutral Tandem within ten (10) business days of AT&T’s notice that a
complex request evaluationfee is required prior to the evaluation of the NBR. Such fee
shall be limited to AT&T’s extraordinary expenses directly related to the complex request.
If Neutral Tandem accepts the complex request evaluation fee amount proposed by
AT&T, Neutral Tandem shall submit such complex request evaluation fee within thirty (30)
business days of AT&T’s notice that a complex request evaluation fee is required.
2.7 Within thirty (30) business days of AT&T’s receipt of the complex request evaluation fee,
AT&T shallrespond toNeutral Tandem by providing a preliminary analysis of such
Requested NBRServices.
2.8 Neutral Tandem may cancel an NBR at any time. If Neutral Tandem cancels the request
more than ten (10) business days after submitting it, Neutral Tandem shall pay AT&T’s
reasonable and demonstrable costs of processing and/or implementing the NBR up to the
date of cancellation in addition to any fee submitted in accordance with Section 1.6 above.
2.9 Neutral Tandem will have thirty (30) business days from receipt of the preliminary analysis
to accept the preliminary analysis or cancel the NBR. If Neutral Tandem fails to respond
within this thirty (30) business day period, the NBR will be deemed cancelled.
2.10 Acceptance ofthe preliminary analysismust be in writing and accompanied by the
estimated Development Rate for the Requested NBR Services quoted in the preliminary
analysis.
2.11 AT&T shall propose a firm price quote including the firm Development Rate, the firm
nonrecurring rate, and the firm recurring rate, and a detailed implementation plan within
ten (10) business days of receipt of Neutral Tandem’s accurate NBR application for a
Requested NBR Service that is operational at the time of the request and within sixty (60)
business days of receipt ofNeutral Tandem’s accurate NBR application for the Requested
NBR Services not operational at the time of the request. The firm nonrecurring rate will
not include any of the Development Rate or the complex request evaluation fee, if
required, in the calculation of this rate. Such firm price quote shall not exceed the
estimate provided with the preliminary analysis by more than twenty-five percent (25%).

2.12 Neutral Tandem shall have thirty (30) business days from receipt of the firm price quote to
accept or deny the firm price quote and submit any additional nonrecurring, non-
refundable fees quoted in the firm price quote. If the firm price quote is less than the
preliminary analysis’ estimate of the Development Rate, AT&T will credit Neutral
Tandem’s account for the difference.
2.13 Upon agreement to the rates,terms and conditionsof a NBR, an amendment to this
Agreement, or a separate agreement, may be required and the Parties shall negotiate
such agreement or amendment in good faith.
