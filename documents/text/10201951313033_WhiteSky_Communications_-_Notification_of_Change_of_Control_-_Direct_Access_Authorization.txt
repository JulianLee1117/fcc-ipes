Re: WC Docket No. 20-160, Interconnected VoIP Numbering Authorization –
WhiteSky Communications, LLC
Dear Ms. Dortch:
WhiteSky Communications, LLC (“WhiteSky”), the holder of an interconnected VoIP
numbering authorization issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau (“Bureau”) of the Federal
Communications Commission on September 21, 2020, see DA 20-1117, respectfully submits this
letter to notify the Bureau of a change in its ownership. Specifically, on December 31, 2020, RP
Newco XXXIV LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealPage, Inc. (“RealPage”) acquired all of
the outstanding membership interests of WhiteSky. RealPage is a Delaware corporation whose
stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock market. Out of an abundance of caution, and
based on informal guidance of Bureau staff, WhiteSky is submitting this notification to request
that the Bureau update its records to the extent necessary to reflect this ownership change.
Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned with any questions regarding this matter.
Sincerely,
/s/ Karen L. Milne
Karen L. Milne
Counsel to the Parties
