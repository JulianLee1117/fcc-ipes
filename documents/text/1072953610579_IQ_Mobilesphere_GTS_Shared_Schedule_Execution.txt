GTS Service Schedule (Shared)
This GTS Service Schedule (Shared) (this “Service Schedule”) is made between MobileSphere LLC
(“Customer”) and Onvoy LLC, d/b/a Inteliquent (“Carrier”). This Service Schedule is made under the
terms of the Master Services Agreement between Customer and Carrier dated 12/07/2007 (as amended, the
“MSA”).
Under the MSA and this Service Schedule, Customer will receive and Carrier will provide the “Services” as
more specifically described in Sections 2 and 3 below. In the event of a conflict between a term in this Service
Schedule and a term in the MSA, the term in this Service Schedule will govern with respect to the Services. The
definitions in the MSA apply to any term that is not defined in this Service Schedule. This Service Schedule is
effective on August 1, 2020 (“Effective Date”).
1. List of market(s); Traffic Types. Carrier will provide the Services in the LATAs mutually agreed to by
the parties. Customer may only use the Services under this Service Schedule for traffic to its own end users.
Customer may not use the Services for wholesale traffic (e.g., traffic from other carriers or communication
service providers).
2. The Services; and Certain Definitions.
2.1 For the purposes of this Service Schedule:

ILEC. “Local Traffic” includes traffic originating from a third party that the ILEC treats as local transit

On-net carrier. “Local Transit Traffic” excludes Local Traffic.
g. “Off-net carrier” or “Off-net IXC carrier” means a third party carrier to which Carrier is not directly
connected.

b. Local Traffic originating from a non-ILEC subscriber transited by the ILEC via the ILEC’s local transit
service.
2.3 Customer will receive from Carrier Local Transit Traffic that originates from Carrier’s third party
provider customers and terminates to Customer via Carrier’s tandem.
2.4 Customer will populate Carrier’s access tandem as the originating and terminating FGD Tandem for
Customer’s NPA/NXX’s so that Switched Access Traffic will be terminated from IXCs via Carrier’s access
homing tandem service.
2.5 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Service Schedule to the contrary, if the serving ILEC in any
LATA refuses to route traffic in the manner set out in the LERG, then either party may terminate the receipt or
provision of the Services in such LATA.
3. Transport Services. Carrier will receive Local Traffic, Local Transit Traffic and Switched Access Traffic
calls and transport all such traffic (the “Transport Service”) to Customer using the interconnection facilities set
out in Section 4.
4. Interconnection. The parties plan to connect using a public IP connection. If the parties subsequently
elect to interconnect using a GigE transport facility, Customer will pay Carrier the charges mutually agreed to by
the parties in writing for such interconnection. Separate trunk groups will be used for any other service provided
by Carrier, such as Carrier’s DID service.
5. Term: The initial term of this Service Schedule will commence on the Effective Date and expire two
years thereafter. The initial term will automatically renew for successive monthly periods, unless either Party
sends written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may terminate this Service Schedule on 30 days’ notice if Carrier
exercises its right to adjust the rates and fees (as set forth in Section 6 or in Exhibit 1).
6. Monthly Charges. In exchange for the Services, Customer will pay the charges set forth on Exhibit 1.
Charges are currently billed in arrears. Carrier may adjust the prices by providing Customer with 30 days’ prior
written notice.
7. Customer Responsibilities.
7.1 Customer will: (a) (i) enter into and maintain any interconnection agreements or traffic exchange
documents required by ILECs serving the local calling area in which the Host Switch is located or (ii) operate in
connection with this Service Schedule as an interconnected VoIP provider (as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §
9.3) to which telephone numbers have been assigned, (b) meet all 911 requirements, including 911
interconnections or waivers, (c) meet any local number portability (LNP/LRN) requirements, (d) obtain a POI
CLLI (common language location identifier) code in the serving LATA to home its NPA/NXX’s, (e) populate
Carrier’s end-office switch in the LERG as the ‘Actual SW ID’ for purposes of receiving Local Traffic and Local
Transit Traffic over the ILEC interconnection trunks and populate Carrier’s access tandem as the originating and
terminating FGD Tandem in the LERG with an effective date that has been agreed to by Carrier, and (f) meet any
other responsibility normally associated with operating as a facilities based local service provider in the state in

7.3 In each calendar month after the Ramp Period, if Customer obtains the Services from Carrier in a market,
Customer must exclusively use Carrier (and no other party) to provide the Services in such market. If Customer
fails to do so in any month, then Carrier may, at its election, terminate this Service Schedule by providing 60
days’ written notice to Customer.
7.4 All third-party Inbound Traffic destined to telephone numbers associated with the Service must be
delivered through Inteliquent. No direct peering (bypassing Carrier’s tandem) will be allowed.
7.5 In each month, on a LATA by LATA basis, for every three-minutes of Switched Access Traffic that
terminates to Customer’s TNs under this Service Schedule, Customer must send one minute of non-local traffic
to Carrier from the same TNs for termination under separate service schedule. For example: If 3,000,000 minutes
of Switched Access Traffic terminates to Customer’s TNs in a LATA during a month, Customer must originate
at least 1,000,000 minutes of non-local traffic from those same TNs in such month. If Customer fails to meet this
ratio requirement, Carrier may impose (and Customer will pay) a $0.0005 per minute surcharge for all Switched
Access Traffic minutes terminating Customer in that LATA for that month.
7.6 In addition to the above, Customer must use Carrier for all required emergency services (9-1-1) and
messaging services (SMS and MMS) for telephone numbers (“TNs”) associated with the Service. These services
will be provided under separate service schedules/orders.
8. Carrier Responsibilities. If applicable, Carrier will provide Customer with a letter of authorization (LOA)
allowing Customer to use Carrier’s Host Switch as the Actual Switch in the LERG. Upon the completion of
installation and testing of interconnection facilities and implementation of the Services using a Host Switch in a
LATA, Carrier will notify Customer, in writing or email, that the Service is available for use.
9. Third Parties. Customer will not charge Carrier any amounts in connection with Local Traffic, Local
Transit Traffic and Switched Access Traffic or otherwise under this Service Schedule. Customer will be
responsible for and indemnify Carrier against any and all charges levied by any third party telecommunications
provider in connection with the Local Traffic, Local Transit Traffic and Switched Access Traffic, including any
intercarrier compensation or termination charges. Customer will be responsible for Carrier’s expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred in successfully collecting any such amounts from Customer.
10. Violations. If Customer violates the no wholesale provision set forth in Section 1, Carrier may (a)
terminate this Service Schedule without any liability by providing Customer with 30-days written notice; or (b)
in addition to the amounts set forth on Exhibit 1, charge Customer an additional per TN fee of $0.08 per TN
(which Customer agrees to pay) from and after the date in which the violation commenced.
11. Limitation of Liability. IF CARRIER IS EVER HELD LIABLE IN RELATION TO THIS SERVICE
SCHEDULE AND WHETHER THE CLAIM IS UNDER CONTRACT, LAW OR ANY OTHER THEORY
OF LIABILITY, CARRIER’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SERVICE SCHEDULE IS LIMITED TO PROVEN
DIRECT DAMAGES AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF (i) THE TOTAL AMOUNT INVOICED
BY CARRIER FOR THE THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR EVENTS IN QUESTION; OR (ii)
$10,000.
