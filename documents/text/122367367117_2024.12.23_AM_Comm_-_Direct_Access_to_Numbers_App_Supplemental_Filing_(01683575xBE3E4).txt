Re: Supplement Number 1 to AM Communication Labs, Inc. Application for
Direct Access to Numbering Resources, with Confidentiality Request for Exhibit D
Dear Ms. Dortch:
Following discussion with Commission Staff, AM Communication Labs, Inc. (“AM Comm”)
hereby supplements its October 30, 2024 Application for Authorization to Obtain Numbering Resources
in the following three respects:
First, Section (K) § 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(K) is amended to replace the final sentence in that section
with this sentence:
AM Comm further warrants that neither the applicant nor any of the identified personnel are
being or have been investigated by the Commission, law enforcement, or any regulatory agency
for failure to comply with any law, rule, or order, including the Commission's rules in this
chapter applicable to unlawful robocalls or unlawful spoofing.
Second, the Certification in Section (L) § 52.15(g)(3)(ii)(L) is amended to state as follows:
AM Comm certifies that it is not itself, and is not affiliated with, a foreign carrier, and that there
are no interlocking directorates with a foreign carrier.
Third, Confidential Exhibit D is amended to include a diagram of the applicant’s vertical
ownership structure. That information is confidential for the same reasons that the original Exhibit D
is confidential, as explained in my October 30, 2024 letter seeking confidential treatment for, inter alia,
that Exhibit under Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459,
and we therefore seek confidential treatment for the supplemental Exhibit D for the reasons given
therein.
Mr. Jantz’s supporting Verification of this supplemental material is enclosed.
