Dear Ms. Dortch:
GetGo Communications LLC (“GetGo Communications”), hereby encloses for filing its
Application to Obtain Numbering Resources (“Application”) and corresponding Attachment A, an
interconnection agreement between GetGo’s carrier partner and a local exchange carrier
(“Interconnection Agreement”). The Application and Interconnection Agreement are sent to you
for filing pursuant to Section 52.15(g)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules.
GetGo Communications respectfully requests that, pursuant to Sections 0.457 and 0.459 of the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.457 and 0.459, the Commission withhold from public
inspection and accord confidential treatment to the Interconnection Agreement. This document
contains trade secrets and commercial, technical and financial information that fall within
Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).1
Exemption 4 of FOIA provides that the public disclosure requirement of the statute “does not
apply to matters that are . . . (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential.”2 GetGo Communications is voluntarily providing
this trade secret and commercial and financial information “of a kind that would not customarily
be released to the public”; therefore, this information is “confidential” under Exemption 4 of
FOIA.3 Moreover, GetGo Communications would suffer substantial competitive harm if the
Interconnection Agreement were disclosed.4
In support of this request and pursuant to Section 0.459(b) of the Commission’s rules,5 GetGo
Communications hereby states as follows:
