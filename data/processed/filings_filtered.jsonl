I work as a social worker and am concerned for my clients as well. I\u2019m writing to urge you to vote NO on 25-208 to ultimately allow AT&T to leave its Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) responsibilties and eliminate copperline landlines in California. This is a gross violation of the The Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA) in California. Removing landlines from elderly and dependent adults constitutes: \n\n\u2013 Neglect by not providing medical care via access landlines during emergencies when cell phones are down\n\n\u2013 Neglect by not protecting the elder and disabled from safety and health hazards\n\n\u2013 Abandonment of the elder and disabled\n\n\u2013 Isolation of the individual\n\n\u2013 Engagement in treatment leading to pain, mental suffering, or physical harm. \n\nIf you approve the removal of landlines, you will be acting with \"oppression, recklessness, malice\" towards the elderly and dependent adults and will be guilty of elder and dependent adult abuse. The California Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act is one of the most powerful acts in California. If a dependent adult or elderly launches a suit for abuse and wins, they automatically are entitled to have all of their attorney fees paid and damages by the opposing side:\n\nThe Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act, provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to, and the recovery of damages by, a plaintiff when it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable for physical abuse or neglect, and the defendant has also been found guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of that abuse.\n\nWhy is this ieven up for a vote after over 5,000 letters poured in from around that state last year objecting to the removal of landlines and they had to extend the hearings because there were so many objections. It\u2019s OUTRAGEOUS that you would even consider putting yourself, your families, and everyone in California at great risk of death during emergencies like earthquakes, fires, and medical emergencies when the power is out.\n\nCopperline landlines are essential infrastructure, providing reliable telephone service and 911 access through most disasters and in power outages. Voice quality is high, and it provides exact location data for callers -- essential in an emergency such as a heart attack, stroke, choking incident, or home invasion. In fires and for evacuation notices, landlines are the difference between life and death. Many Californians require 24/7 access to family and medical personnel due to health conditions, and no other service provides that dependability.  For those disabled by electromagnetic sensitivity -- as many as one million or more Californians, according to a state public health survey -- these landlines are the safest and only telephone service they can use.\n\nOther systems are fragile and undependable. In a power outage, when the batteries die, there is no telephone service at all and no access to 911. Cell phones drop calls and often have difficult-to-understand voice quality.\n\nCOLR means that everyone in AT&T's service territory gets telephone service without discrimination. There is no substitute. Without COLR, there will be a haves and have nots system, which is unacceptable and going backward in time to when only a few enjoyed telephone service.\n\nVote NO on 25-208! This is yet another example of corporate greed and shortsightedness attempting to override public safety!\n\nSincerely, ", "date_last_modified": "2025-09-30T14:10:47.035Z", "authors": [], "_index": "filings.2025.9", "exparte_or_late_filed": "N"}

Keeping it locked is nothing but  unfair and something that keeps people tied down when they should be free to take their business elsewhere. Is this not the land of the free and the home of the brave?! \n\nThere\u2019s no good reason for this. Seriously\nThe carriers already recover their money through service fees, extra lock-in only LIMITS competition and gouges customers. Other countries don\u2019t allow this kind of endless lock and we shouldn\u2019t either. We are America! \n\nIf a phone is paid off, it should be unlocked automatically! No waiting, no runaround, no fine print, it\u2019s common sense! Please put clear rules in place to stop carriers from holding our devices hostage once we\u2019ve paid in full!

Go to this link\n2. For \"Proceeding\" put 23-320\n3. Fill out the form\n4. In \"brief comments\" register your thoughts on net neutrality. We recommend this, which you can copy and paste or edit for yourself:\n\nNet neutrality is the principle that all internet service providers treat all traffic coming through their networks without discrimination. The effect of this principle is that customers decide for themselves how they\u2019d like to experience the internet. The Commission\u2019s rules as currently written leave open the door for positive discrimination of content, that is, the supposed creation of fast lanes where some content is sped up relative to others. This isn\u2019t how the internet works, but in any case, whether an ISP is speeding up or slowing down content, the end result is the same: the ISP picks the winners and losers on the internet. As such the Commission must create bright line rules against all forms of discrimination, speeding up or slowing down, against apps or classes of apps on general traffic in the internet.\n\nFurther, while the Commission currently finds state net neutrality rules, like California\u2019s, to not be preempted because they \u201cgenerally track\u201d its own rules, it makes it easy to rule otherwise at a future date. But just as we received net neutrality in 2015 only to have it taken away in 2017, there is no guarantee that the Commission will continue to find state net neutrality laws passed post-2017 to be consistent with the rules. To safeguard net neutrality, the Commission must find that California\u2019s law is wholly consistent with their rules and that preemption is taken as a floor, not a ceiling, so that states can go above and beyond the federal standard without it being considered inconsistent with the federal rule.\n\nTAKE ACTION NOW", "date_last_modified": "2024-04-17T19:57:22.477Z", "authors": [], "_index": "filings.2024.4", "exparte_or_late_filed": "N"}

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies the ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.", "authors": [], "_index": "filings.2017.11", "exparte_or_late_filed": "N"}
